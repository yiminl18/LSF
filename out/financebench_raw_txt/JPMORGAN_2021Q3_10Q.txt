Firmwide overview 
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $11.7 billion for 
the third  quarter of 2021 , or $3.74 per share, on net 
revenue of $29.6 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 18% 
and ROTCE of 22%. The Firm's results for the third  quarter 
of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses of $2.1 billion and an income tax benefit of $566 
million related to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax 
return. The tax benefit included state and local impacts of 
federal tax method changes and a reduction in the valuation 
allowance for U.S. foreign tax credits.
•Net income was $11.7 billion, up $2.2 billion.
•Total net revenue was up 1%.
–Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 2%, driven 
by higher Investment Banking fees in CIB and asset 
management fees in AWM, predominantly offset by ne t 
investment securities losses in Corporate compared to 
net gains in the prior year, and lower revenue in Home 
Lending.–Net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 1%, driven 
by balance sheet growth and higher market rates, 
predominantly offset by change in balance sheet mix 
and lower net interest income in CIB Markets.
•Noninterest expense was $ 17.1 billion, up 1%, driven by 
continued investments in the business, including 
marketing and technolog y, and higher volume- and 
revenue-related expense, predominantly offset by lower 
legal expense and structural expense . Noninterest 
expense for the prior year included an impairment  on a 
legacy investment.
•The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.5 
billion, reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for 
credit losses of $2.1 billion, driven by improvements in 
the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and $524 million of 
net charge-offs. 
–The net reserve release in the current period consisted 
of $1.2 billion in Wholesale and $874 million in 
Consumer, driven by $850 million in Card.
–Net charge-offs of $524 million declined $656 million, 
predominantly driven by Card.

reflecting $1.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net

•The total allowance for credit losses was $20.5 billion at 
September 30, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.86%, 
compared with 2.02% in the second quarter of 2021, 
and 3.26% in the prior year.
•The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.9 billion at 
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the 
prior year, driven by: 
–paydowns and upgrades in the wholesale portfolio, 
across CB, CIB and AWM, and
–lower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the consumer 
portfolio due to sales in CIB. 
Nonperforming assets were down $920 million from June 
30, 2021, driven by lowe r nonaccrual loans in the 
wholesale and consumer portfolios, reflecting improved 
credit performance and paydowns .
•Firmwide average loans o f $1.0 trillion were up 5% 
driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM, partially offset by  
lower loans in CB and CCB.
•Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 19%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily 
driven by the effect of certain government actions in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business Developments 
COVID-19 Pandemic
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has remained 
focused on serving its clients, customers and communities, 
as well as the well-being of its employees.
The Firm continues to actively monitor the health and 
safety situations at local and regional levels as more of the 
Firm's global workforce returns to the office, and will adapt 
its plans as these situations evolve .

Form 10-K for a discussion of U.S. government actions 
impacting  the Firm and U.S. government facilities and 
programs in which  the Firm has participated.  Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority 
("FCA") confirmed that the publication of the principal 
tenors of the U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate 
("LIBOR") (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-
month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease immediately 
following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The 
scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, 
Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and two-
month ten ors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31, 
2021 . The Firm continues to prioritize thos e currencies and 
tenors of LIBOR for contract remediati on and is finalizing its 
operational readiness to support rate fallback mechanisms 
across all products that reference IBORs  for which 
publication will cease on  December 31, 2021 .
The Firm continues to engage with clients to arrange for the 
remediation of in-scope IBOR-linked contracts, and to 
amend contracts with clients that are prepared to do so. For 
example, substantially all  of the notional amount s of the 
Firm’s derivatives exposures that are documented under 
bilateral agreements now contain  IBOR fallback provisions 
by virtue of counterparty adherence to the 2020 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.’s 
("ISDA") IBOR Fallbacks Protocol. The Firm is also prepared 
for the conversion to alternative reference rates at various 
central counterparties ("CCPs") scheduled for th e fourth 
quarter of 2021.
The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have 
encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that 
use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 
2021 , and in connection with this, the Firm now offers  
various floating rate products, and provides and arranges 
various types of floating rate debt financings, that reference 
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) across its 
businesses . 
The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being 
considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the 
tax implications of reference rate reform and the legislative 
progress associated with contracts or instruments that do 
not have satisfactory rate fallback mechanisms and that 
cannot easily be amended (e.g., certain floating rate debt 
securities, securitizations and adjustable rate mortgages) .

(b)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
Quarterly results
Investment  banking fees  increased across products in CIB, 
primarily reflecting:
•higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and  
wallet share gains , and
•higher equity underwriting fees due to wallet share gains 
and increased activity i n the IPO market .
Refer to C IB segment results on pages 29-34  and Note 5 for 
additional information.
Principal  transactions revenue  decreased,  reflecting:
•lower revenue in  CIB Fixed Income Markets across 
products, particularly in Commodities, Rates and Credit 
compared to a strong prior year, including an adjustment 
to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio; and
•net losses on certain legacy private equ ity investments in 
Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year,
partially offset by
•higher rev enue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong 
performance across prime brokerage, derivatives and 
Cash equities.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its 
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34   and Note 5 
for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees  increased larg ely as a 
result of higher cash management fees in CIB and CB.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34  and CB on 
pages 35-38 , and Note 5 for additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue  increased driven by higher asset management fees 
in AWM as a result of  cumulative net inflows into long-term 
products and higher average market levels, net of liquidity 
fee waivers; and in CCB related to the higher level of client 
investment assets on higher average market levels  and net 
inflows.
Refer to AWM and CCB segment results on pages 39-43 , 
and pages 24-28 , respectively, and Note 5 for additional 
information on asset management, administration and 
commissions revenue.
Investment  securities gains/(losses)  reflected net losses  
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio, 
compared with net gains in the prior year  from the sales of 
U.S. GSE and government agency mortgage-backed 
securities ("MBS") . Refer to  Corporate segment results on 
pages 44-46  and Note 9 for additional information on 
investment securities gains/(losses).
Mortgage fees and related income  decreased due to:
•lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net 
loss in MSR risk management r esults  driven by u pdates to 
model inputs, com pared with a net gain in the prior 
period, and
10
•lower mortgage production revenue reflecting  lower 
production margins, partially offset by higher volumes .
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28 , Note 5 and 
14 for additional information.
Card income  decreased  reflecting the amortization of 
higher account origination costs, including  promotional 
offer s. Net interchange w as relatively flat as the increase in 
debit and credit card sales volume was offset by an increase 
to the rewards liability . Refer to CCB segment results on 
pages 24-28 , Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88 , 
and Note 5 for additional information.
Other income  increased reflecting: 
•higher gains  on several investments, predominantly in  
CIB, and
•the absence of losses in the prior year related to 
derivatives in Other Corporate and the early termination 
of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and 
CIO, 
partially offset by
•lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of 
the decline in volume .
Net interest income  increased driven by balance sheet 
growth and higher market rates, primarily offset by change 
in balance sheet mix and lower net interest income in CIB 
Markets.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $345 billion, primarily driven by higher deposits 
with banks, and the yield was 1.80%, down 25 basis points 
(“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 
1.62%, a decrease of 20 bps. The net yield excluding CIB 
Markets was 1.91%, down 14 bps.
Net yield on an FTE basis, and n et yield excluding CIB 
Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the 
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates 
schedule on page 183  for further details; and the 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21  for a further 
discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.
Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees  increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting:
•higher advisory fee s driven by  increased M&A activity and 
wallet share gains
•higher equity under writing fees due to increased activity 
and wallet share gains  in the IPO market, and
•higher debt underwriting fees  driven by an active 
leveraged loan market primarily related to acquisition 
financing.
Principal transactions revenue  decreased driven by CIB, 
reflecting:
•lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets, primarily in 
Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Commodities 
compared to a strong prior year,  and an increase in 
Securitized Products,partially offset by
•higher revenue in Equity Markets driven by strong 
performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and 
Cash Equities,
•favorable results in Credit Adjustments & Other, with a 
net gain of $338 million largely driven by valuation 
adjustments related to derivatives, compared with a 
$272 million net loss, in the prior year, predominantly 
driven by losses on certain components of fair-value 
option elected liabilities, as well as the impact of funding 
spread widening on derivatives; and
•the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash 
deployment transactions in the prior year, which were 
more than offset by the related net interest income earned 
on these transactions.
Lending- and deposit-related fees  increased as a result of:
•higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher 
lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees 
in CIB,  
predominantly offset by
•lower overdraft fees in CCB.
Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue  increased driven by:
•higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of 
strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity 
products  and higher average market levels, net of 
liquidity fee waivers; and in CCB related to the higher 
level of client investment assets on higher average 
market levels  and net inflows, and
•higher custody  fees  in CIB Securities Services, primarily 
associated with the higher level of assets under custody .
Investment se curities gains/(losses)  reflected net losses  
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio, 
compared with net gains in the prior year from the sales of 
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.
Mortgage fees and related income  decreased due to:
•lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net 
loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to 
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior year,
partially offset by
•higher mortgage production revenue reflecting  higher 
production volumes.
Card income  increased due to higher net interchange 
income and merchant processing fees reflecting the 
acceleration of debit and credit card sales volume above 
pre-pandemic levels, and lower  amortization costs related 
to new account originations .
Other income  increased reflecting:
•gains on several investments compared with losses in the 
prior year, primarily in CIB, and higher gains in AWM, and
•the absence of losses in the prior year related to the early 
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in 
Treasury and CIO, and derivatives in Other Corporate,
11
predominantly offset by
•lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of 
the decline in volume, and
•increased amortization on a higher level of alternative 
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment 
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more 
than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits. Additionally, the first quarter of 
2021 included weather-related write-downs on certain 
renewable energy investments.
Net interest income  decreased predominantly driven by the 
impact of lower market rates and change in balance sheet 
mix, partially offset by balance sheet growth. 
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $454 billion, predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield 
was 1.82%, down 65 bps. The net yield on these assets, on 
an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease of 40 bps. The net 
yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.92%, down 49 bps.

The decrease in wholesale  reflected a net reduction of $1.2 
billion in the  allowance for credit losse s, predominantly in 
CIB and CB . The prior year included a $270 million net 
reduction in the allowance for credit losses.
The decrease in consumer  was driven by:
•an $874 million reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, in partic ular $850 million in Card reflecting 
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and
•lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card as consumer 
cash balances remained elevated benefiting from the

The decrease in consumer  was driven by:
•an $8.0 billion reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, including $6.2 billion in Card reflecting 
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and 
$1.2 billion in Home Lending primarily due to continued 
improvements in Home Price Index ("HPI") expectations,

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks  
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in 
deposits and limited deployment opportunities in Treasury 
and CIO. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements 
of its excess cash with various central banks, including the 
Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements  decreased driven by:
•lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and lower 
client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets,
partially offset by
•higher demand for securities to cover short positions in 
CIB Markets.
Securities borrowed  increased reflecting higher client-
driven activities, and an increase in the demand for 
securities to cover short positions in CIB Markets.
Refer Note 10 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading assets  increased reflecting;
•client-driven market-making activities in equity 
instruments, predominantly in CIB prime brokerage,
partially offset by
•lower derivative receivables, primarily driven by 
maturities of certain trades in CIB, and
•lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.  
Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.Investment securities  increased due to purc hases and 
paydowns in held-to-maturity  ("HTM") securities, partially 
offset by paydowns and net purchases i n available-for-sale 
("AFS") securities. In the second quarter of 2021, AFS 
securities of $104.5 billion were transferred to the HTM 
portfolio for capital management purposes. Refer to 
Corporate segment results on pages 44-46 , Investment 
Portfolio Risk Management on page 77 , and Notes 2 and 9 
for additional information.
Loans  increased, reflecting :
•higher secured lending in CIB Markets; and  higher 
securities-based lending, mortgages, as well as custom 
lending in AWM,
partially offset by
•lower loans in C BB and CB primarily driven by the impact 
of PPP forgiveness;  and lower retained residential real 
estate loans in Home Lending primarily due to net 
paydowns .
The allowance for loan losses  decreased, consisting of:
•a $7.9 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and in the residential real 
estate portf olio, primarily due to continued 
improvements in HPI expectations , and
•a $2.3 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook.
There was a $104 million net reduction in the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, driven by both wholesale and 
consumer. This allowance is included in other liabilities on 
the consolidated balance sheets. The total  net reduction in 
16
the allowance for credit losses was $10.3 billion, as of 
September 30, 2021.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
59-77 , and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable  increased due to 
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities 
primarily in CIB  prime brokerage.Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles  increased reflecting:
•higher MSRs as a result of net additions, partially offset 
by the realization of expected cash flows; and
•an increase in Goodwill as a result of the acquisitions  of 
Nutmeg, OpenInvest, Frank and Campbell Global.  
Refer  to Note 14 for additional information.
Other assets  increased due to the higher cash collateral 
placed with central counterparties ("CCPs") in CIB, and 
higher tax receivables . Refer to Note 10 for additional 
informati on on securities financing transactions.

Deposits  increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the 
effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID 19 pandemic. I n CCB, the increase was also driven by 
growth from existing  and new accounts across both 
consumer and small business customers . Refer to Liquidity 
Risk Management on pages 54-58  and Notes 2 and 15 for 
additional information. 
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements  increased reflecting:
•the impact of client activities and secured financing of 
trading assets in CIB Markets,
partially offset by
•lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-58  and 
Note 10 for additional information.
Short-term borrowings increased predominantly as a result 
of higher financing of prime brokerage activities in CIB. 
Refer to pages 54-58  for information on changes in 
Liquidity Risk Management. 
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which 
resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt 
instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables 
largely as a result of market movements.  Refer to Notes 2 
and 4 for additional information.Accounts payable and other liabilities  increased reflecting 
higher client payables related to client-driven activities 
primarily in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10 for 
additional information on securities financing transactions.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs  decreased  
driven by maturities of credit card securitizations in 
Treasury and CIO , as well as lower issuances of commercial 
paper as a result of lower loan balances in the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits in CIB . Refer to Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 19 and Notes 13 and 
22 for additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and 
loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt  increased driven by net issuances, partially 
offset by  fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to 
higher rates. Refe r to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
54-58  for additional information. 
Stockholders’ equity  increased reflecting net income, 
partially offset by the net impact of capital actions, and a  
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of 
higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow 
hedges. Refer to page 94  for information on changes in 
stockholders’ equity, Capital actions on pages 51-52 , and 
Note 19 for additional information on AOCI.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that 
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 
Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities 
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). 
The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts 
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.
The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions 
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. 
The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements 
can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 91-95 .
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
l e v e l .   T h e s e  n o n - G A A P  m e a s u r e s  i n c l u d e :
•Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 
overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” 
basis)•Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 
less total noninterest expense
•Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets
•TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS
•Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 
excluding Firmwide legal expense
•Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 
excluding trade finance and conduits.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.
The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21  for a 
definition of managed basis.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses 
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an 
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business 
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and 
analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm 
allocates interest income and expense to each business 
segment and transfers the primary interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and CIO within Corporate. 
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate 
risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements on a product-
by-product basis within each business segment.
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and 
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refer to Line of business equity on  page 51 , and  page 98 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on capital allocation.
Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66  of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for a further discussion 
of those methodologies.

Quarterly results  
Net income was $4.3 billion , up 12% , driven by a decrease 
in the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $12.5 billion , a decrease of 3%. 
Net interest income was $8.4 billion , up 4%, driven by:
•growth in deposits  net of margin compression as well as  
the impacts from PPP including the accelerated 
recognition of deferred processing fees due to loan 
forgiveness in CBB, lower  prepayments in Home Lending, 
higher auto loans, a nd lowe r funding costs in Card,  
partial ly offset by
•lower revolving loans in Card due to the impact of higher 
payments and lower cumulative sales volume throughout 
2020 .Noninterest revenue was $4.1 billion , down 15% , driven 
by:
•lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net 
loss in MSR risk management results  driven by updates to 
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior 
period,
•lower auto operating lease income as a result of the 
decline in volume,
•lower  card income reflecting the amortization of higher 
account origination costs, including promotional offers, 
while net interchange was relatively flat as the increase in  
debit and credit card sales volume was offset by an 
increase to the rewards liability, and
•lower mortgage production revenue reflecting  the net 
impact of lower production margins and higher volumes, 
24
partially offset by
•higher asset management fees related to the higher level 
of client investment assets on higher average market 
levels and net inflows.
Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Critical 
Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88 , and Note 5 for 
additional information on card income. 
Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion , up 5%, driven by:
•continued investments in the business, including 
marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing 
campaigns and travel-related benefits,
•higher expense reflecting growth across the businesses,  
including performance-related compensation ,
partially offset by 
•lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and the 
impact of higher vehicle collateral values.
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $459 
million , compared with an expense of $795 million  in the 
prior year, driven by:
•a $950 million reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, reflecting improvements in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook consisting of $850 m illion  in 
Card and $100 million in CBB, and
•lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting 
from the residual impact of government stimulus and 
payment assistance programs.
The prior year included a $300 million reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
59-77  and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76  for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

and growth in CBB ,
largely offset by
•lower funding costs in Card related to changes in portfolio 
mix and the impacts from PPP including the accelerated 
recognition of deferred processing fees due to loan 
forgiveness in CBB.Noninterest revenue was $13.5 billion , up 2%, driven by:
•higher card income due to higher net interchange income  
reflecting the acceleration of debit and credit c ard sales 
volume in 2021, above pre-pandemic levels, and lower  
amortization costs related to new account originations ,
•higher asset management fees related to the higher level 
of client investment assets on higher average market 
levels and net inflows, and 
•higher mortgage production reve nue re flecting higher 
production volumes,
offset by
•lower net mortgage servicing revenue as a result of a net 
loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to 
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior 
period,
•lower auto operating lease income as a result of the 
decline in volum e, and
•lower overdraft fees.

•continued investments in the business , including 
marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing 
campaigns and travel-related benefits,

including performance-related compensation,
largely offset by
•lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and the 
impact of higher vehicle collateral values
•lower structural expenses.
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $5.9 
billion , compared with an expense of $12.4 billion  in the 
prior year, driven by: 
•an $8.2 billion reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, driven by improvements in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook, consisting of $6.2 billion in 
Card, $1.2 billion in Home Lending, primarily due to 
continued improvements in HPI expectations, $575 
million in CBB and $225 million in Auto, and 
•lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting 
from the  impact of government stimulus and payment 
assistance programs.
The prior year included an $8.7 billion addition to the 
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets 
revenue on page 74 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K 
for further information.
For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.4 billion , up 30% , largely driven by a 
decrease in the provision for credit losses. 
Net revenue was $2.5 billion , up 10%. Net interest income 
was $1.5 billion , up 1%, driven by the impact of lower 
funding costs on loans and higher deposit balances, largely 
offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest revenue 
was $988 million , up 30% , driven by higher investment 
banking revenue and wholesale payments revenue. 
Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion , up 7%, 
predominantly driven by higher investments in the business 
and higher volume- and revenue- related expense .      
The provision for credit losses  was a net benefit of $363 
million , driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with a net benefit  of $147 million in the 
prior year.

losses, compared with an expense of $265 million  in the 
prior year.Asset Management has two high-level measures of its 
overall fund performance.
Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer group 
quartile rankings of its funds from Lipper to Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled 
funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor” funds, for which the source 
remains Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds. AWM evaluates fund 
performance utilizing this peer group ranking and believes that it provides 
investors with comparability across the industry. This change resulted in 
positive impacts on the quartile rankings shown in the following table, and 
both positive and negative impacts on the quartile rankings for prior periods, 
as compared to how they would have been ranked by Lipper. In addition, 
AWM has changed its selection of the “primary share class” for certain non-
U.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent 
approach across these products. Prior periods in the following table have 
been revised to conform to the current presentation.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- 
or 5-star:  Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best 
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-
star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-
star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-
wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a 
weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- 
and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share 
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted 
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not 
rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned 
peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are 
sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the 
fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The 
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for 
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the 
star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides 
ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if 
all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked 
in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years) : All quartile 
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive 
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile 
rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where 
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. 
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and 
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, 
at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., 
Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other 
funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes 
had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
“Primary share class ” means the C share class for European funds and Acc 
share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not 
available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $817 million  compared with a net loss of $699 
million  in the prior year.
Net revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion , down $957 million, 
driven by:
•limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth 
continued,
•net investment securities losses related to repositioning 
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net 
gains in the prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS, and
•net losses on certain legacy private equity investments, 
compared with net gains in the prior year,
partially offset by
•the absence of losses in the prior year related to 
derivatives in Other Corporate and the early termination 
of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and 
CIO
Noninterest expense of $160 million  was down $559 
million primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on 
a legacy investment in the prior year and lower structural 
expense.The current period income tax benefit was predominantly 
driven by an income tax benefit of $383 million related to 
finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax return and the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal and state and local taxes.
Year-to-date results
Net loss was $2.6 billion  compared with a net loss of $1.4 
billion  in the prior year.
Net revenue was a loss of $2.9 billion , compared with a loss 
of $927 million  in the prior year, primarily driven by lower 
net interest income on limited deployment opportunities as 
deposit growth continued.
Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to:
•net investment securities losses related to repositioning 
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net 
gains in the prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS,
predominantly offset by
•the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash 
deployment transactions in the prior year, which were 
44
more than offset by the related n et interest income 
earned on th ese transactions, and
•the absence of losses in the prior year related to the early 
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in 
Treasury and CIO and derivatives in Other Corporate
Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion  was up $539 million  
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's 
Foundation a nd higher legal and technology expense, 
partially offset by the absence of an impairment on a legacy 
investment in the prior year.
The current period income tax benefit was driven by the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, the impact of the 
Firm's estimated full-year expected tax rate relative to the 
level of year-to-date pretax income, as well as an income 
tax benefit of $383 million related to finalizing the Firm's 
2020 U.S. federal tax return.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm.  
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 
•Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 
•Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 
•Firmwide structures for risk governance. 
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 
Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.

for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management 
governance and oversight.Risk governance and oversight functions

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 
The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. 
Refer to pages 91-101  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and 
stress testing.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S.  Bank Holding Companies 
("BHCs ") and banks, including the Firm and its insured 
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries,  including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of 
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), 
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive 
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a 
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an 
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the 
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is 
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approac hes compared to their respective 
minimum capital ratios.  
The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios.  
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the  SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding 
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios . Refer to 
SLR on page 51  for additional information.
Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition delay . As part of their 
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided 
the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of 
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022  
(“CECL capital transition provisions”). 
The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended 
September 30, 2021, the capital metrics of  the Firm 
exclud e $ 3 . 3   b i l l i o n, which is the $2.7 billion  day 1 impact 
to retained earnings and 25% of the $ 1 . 9   b i l l i o n increase 
in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 
(excluding allowances on PCD loans).   
The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have 
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, and total leverage exposure.  Refer to Capital Risk 
Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL 
capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting 
guidance.  
PPP.  On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued 
an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 
2020) to neutralize  the regulatory capital effects of 
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by 
applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated 
under the program. The Firm does not expect to realize 
material credit losses on PPP loans  because the loans are 
guaranteed by the SBA. As of September 30, 2021, the 
Firm had approximately $13 billion of loans remaining 
under the program.  
Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them 
under the final rule.  
TLAC Holdings rule . On October 20, 2020, the federal 
bank ing agencies issued a final rule prescribing the 
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain 
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing 
capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital 
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC 
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking 
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 
and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based 
capital metrics.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108  of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR 
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s 
website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk 
Management.
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible  HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress.  Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible 
HQLA held by  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of 
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that 
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded 
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.  The LCR  for both 
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%.  Refer to page 103  of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports 
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, June 30, 2021 and S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,

securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(d)Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 
The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months 
ended September 30, 2021, compared with the three-
month period ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in cash from long-term debt issuances during the 
second quarter 2021.
The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months 
ended September 30, 2021, compared with the prior year 
period primarily due to the relative impact on net cash 
outflows from the significant increase in deposits.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during 
the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared 
with both the three month periods ended June 30, 2021 
and Sep tember  30, 2020 primarily due to growth in 
deposits. Deposits continued to increase in the third quarter 
primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in 
excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded 
from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.
The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR 
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity.  
Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable 
securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm 
believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes 
excess eligible HQLA securities  at JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair 
value of these securities was approximately $878 billion  
and $740 billion  as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively , although the amount of 
liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on 
prevailing market conditions.  The fair value increased 
compared to December 31, 2020, due to an increase in 
excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which 
was primarily a result of higher deposit s as well as an 
increase in CIB trading assets .
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity a t the 
Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral 
pledged by the Firm to such banks of approxima tely $303 
billion  and $307 billion  as of  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively. This borrowing capacity 
excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the 
Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that 
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and other central banks.  Although available, the 
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal 
Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks 
as a primary source of liquidity.
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and 
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year 
horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies 
54
issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking 
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% 
on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule became effective 
on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly 
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually 
beginning in 2023. As of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. are compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR, 
based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule.
Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity.  Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from  the 
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company 
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily 
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by  Treasury and CIO  in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term 
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity 
risk characteristics.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.  
The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of

market disruption those trends could be affected.
Average deposits increased for the three and nine months 
ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three and nine 
months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting significant 
inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of 
certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth 
from  existing and new accounts across both consumer and 
small business customers.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.  
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 
at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, compared with D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020 , reflecting the impact of client activities and secured 
financing of trading assets in CIB Markets,  partially offset by  
lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO.
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist 
of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale 
commercial paper.  The decrease in commercial paper at 
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 was due to 
lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity 
management.
The increase in unsecured o ther borrowed funds a t 
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, and for 
the average three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  
2021  compared to the prior y ear period, was primarily due 
to net issuances of structured notes and higher overdrafts 
in CIB Markets.
56
Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable 
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, 
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, 
including  TLAC . Long-term funding objectives include 
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various 
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its 
optimal long-term funding plan.  The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured 
funding is issued by  the Parent Company to provide 
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary 
funding needs.  The Parent Company advances substantially 
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC.  The IHC 
does not issue debt to external counterparties.  The 
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance 
and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine 
months ended  September 30, 2021 and 2020 . Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108  and Note 20 
of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K for additional

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 19 , and 
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 
4 for additional information on the impact of a credit 
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, 
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1,

amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 
In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans 
from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory 
guidance.
The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. 
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan 
modifications have not been considered troubled debt 
restructurings ( “TDRs ”). Assistance provided in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of 
delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for 
those customers and clients who would have otherwise 
moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Refer to

of PPP loans remaining, including $11 billion  and $19 
billion, respectively, in the consumer portfolio, and $2 
billion  and $8 billion, respectively, in the wholesale 
portfolio. Since inception of the Program , the Firm funded 
approximately $40 billion of loans. The PPP ended on May 
31, 2021 for new applications . 
The Firm continues to process forgiveness applications, and 
through S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately $ 27 billion  of 
loans were forgiven by the SBA. This resulted in accelerated 
recognition in interest income of the associated deferred 
processing fees , primarily in CCB .

Consumer assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals. During the 
third quarter of 2021, there were approximately $390 
million of new enrollments in consumer payment deferral 
programs .
As of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm had approximately $3.7 
billion of retained consumer loans under payment deferral 
programs, a decrease of approximately $24.6 billion from  
June 30, 2020.  The loans under deferral were predominantly 
in residential real estate.  Predominantly all borrowers that 
exited payment deferral programs are current . The Firm 
continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans 
subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period 
and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to 
resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers 
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these 
loans in its allowance for credit losses.
Of the $3.7 billion of retained loans still under payment 
deferral programs as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately 
$1.6 billion were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment 
deferral and approximately $100 million were accounted for 
as TDRs because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not

provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 driven by higher 
residential real estate loans at fair value, partially offset by 
lower retained residential real estate loans.
Residential real estate:  The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans a nd 
home equity lines of credit.
Retained loans declined from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 due to 
paydowns outpacing originations of prime mortgage loans 
in Home Lending, largely offset by growth in AWM. Retained 
nonaccrual loans decreased  from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 
reflecting improved credit performance . The three and nine 
month periods ending S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 reflected net 
recoveries benefiting from further improvement in HPI and 
higher reversals of prior write-downs due to loan 
prepayments as a result of the low rate environment 
compared to net charge-offs for the three months ended 
September 30, 2020 , and lower net recoveries for the nine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 0.  In addition, the nine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 0 included a recovery on 
a loan sale.
Loans at fair value increased from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
reflecting loan purchase activity in CIB driven by higher 
client demand, as well as increased originations in Home 
Lending due to the continued low rate environment . 
Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 
31, 2020 due to sales in CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $19.8 billion  at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1. This 
amount included $6.6 billion  of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $6.4 billion  of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.
At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the 
carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans 
were $27.8 billion  and $25.6 billion , respectively. These 
loans have an interest-only payment period generally 
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing 
payment period to maturity and are typically originated as 
higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, 
predominantly in AWM. Net recoveries and charge-offs for 
the three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, 
respectively, were not material, as the credit performance 
of this portfolio is generally in line with the performance of 
the broader prime mortgage portfolio.The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information relating to 
modified retained residential real estate loans for which 
concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified 
PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table 
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions and, 
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has 
elected to apply the option to suspend the application of 
accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act 
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Refer 
to Note 11 for further information on modifications for the 
three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and

pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to 
foreclosure. Refer to Note 13 for additional information about sales of 
loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae.
(b)At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, nonaccrual loans

were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020 Form 10-K for additional information about loans modified in a 
TDR that are on nonaccrual status.
63
Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio was relatively flat  when 
compared with D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 due to growth in the 
scored auto portfolio predominantly offset by a decrease in 
business banking loans. The increase in the scored auto 
portfolio was predominantly driven by loan originations 
largely offset by paydowns. Business Banking loans declined 
due to PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns largely offset by 
loan originations.  Net charge offs for the three months 
ended September 30, 2021 increased when compared to 
the same period in the prior year primarily due to 
overdrafts. Net charge offs for the nine months ended 
September 30, 2021 decreased when compared to the 
same period in the prior year primarily due to lower auto 
charge-offs as the current year had a greater benefit from 
government stimulus, payment assistance programs, and 
higher vehicle collateral values. The scored auto portfo lio 
net charge-off rates were 0.03%  and 0.04%  for the three 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020, 
respectively, and 0.01%  and 0.28%  for the nine months

Credit card
Total credit card loans were relatively flat from 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 reflecting higher payments, offset by 
strong sales volume in the second and third quarters of 
2021.  The S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 1.00%  and 0.49% , respectively, 
decreased compared to the D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68%  and 0.92% , 
respectively. The delinquency rates continue to be 
positively impacted by government stimulus and support 
provided to borrowers who participated in payment 
assistance programs. Net charge-offs decreased for the 
three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 
compared with the  prior year periods reflecting lower 
charge-offs and higher recoveries as consumer cash 
balances remained elevated benefiting from the impact of 
government stimulus and payment assistance programs.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and

Modifications of credit card loans
At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm had $1.1 billion  of credit 
card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, 
which does not include loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs, 
compared to $1.4 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. Refer to 
Note 11 for additional information about loan modification 
programs to borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 68-71  for further information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated 
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto 
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the credit 
environment continued to improve follo wing the broad-
based deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
As of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, retained loans increased $17.8 
billion driven by CIB and AWM pa rtially  offset by decreases 
in CB and CCB. In CB, the decrease was largely driven by a 
net decrease in PPP loans. Lending-related commitments 
increased $49.4 billion, predominantly driven by net 
portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held 
for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.
In the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the 
investment-grade percentage of the credit portfolio 
decreased from 71%  to 70%  driven by net portfolio 
activity, including new commitments. Criticized exposure 
was $41.6 billion  at both S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. Nonperforming exposure decrea sed 
$814 million driven by lower nonperforming loans, largely 
in Oil & Gas and Individuals and Individual Entities, with net 
portfolio activity and select upgrades being partially offset 
by select downgrades. The decrease in nonperforming loans 
was partially offset by an increase in nonperforming 
derivatives. N et charge-offs were $100 million.Wholesale credit portfolio

predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form 
of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
As of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm had approximately $ 177 million of retained loans under payment deferral, which decreased 
from $16.8 billion at  June 30, 2020 . Predominantly all clients that exited deferral are current or have paid down their loans . The 
Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an 
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of 
principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.
In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment deferrals 
and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant or they 
qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit 
risk management framework. As of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, substantially all of these loans were considered performing.
Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings pr ofile

2021 , and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/
Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal 
risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk 
ratings.

conditions.
67
Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the 
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, was $41.6 billion at both S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, representing approximately 3.8% and 4.0% 
of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively, as select downgrades were offset by select upgrades and net portfolio activity.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.
The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  
2021  and 2020 . Since September 30, 2020, nonaccrual 
loan exposure decreased $1.7 billion, largely in Oil & Gas

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of 
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is 
generally held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty 
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the 
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives 
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter 
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed 
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the 
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from 
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable 
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative 
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding 
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically 
covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily 
— was approximately 88%  at both S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, 
and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. Refer to Note 4 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. 
Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative 
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $67.9 billion  and $75.4 
billion  at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
respectively, with decreases primarily driven by maturities 
of certain trades in CIB. Derivative receivables represent the 
fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to 
legally enforceable master netting agreements and the 
related cash collateral held by the Firm. 
In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and 
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s 
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the 
definition of liquid securities is consistent with the 
definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR 
rule. 
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but 
that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral 
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net 
derivative receivables for the counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative 
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains 
credit protection against certain loans in the retained 
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related 
notes. Information on credit portfolio management 
activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and
•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is 
reflected within Investment Securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 
was $20.5 billion , a decrease from $30.8 billion  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The decrease in the allowance for 
credit losses reflected:
•an $8.0 billion  reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and
•a $2.3 billion  net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook.  
The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many  macroeconomic 
variables (“MEVs”) used in the Firm's allowance estimate 
which has created challenges in the use of modeled credit 
loss estimates, increased the reliance on management 
judgment, and resulted in adjustments to appropriately 
address the economic circumstances. These adjustments 
continued through the third quarter of 2021, although to a 
lesser extent than experienced during 2020 .
The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the 
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse 
scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including the 
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may 
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of 
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government 
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in 
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on 
certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm 
retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in 
the third quarter of 2021, in line with the second quarter of 
2021, but to a lesser extent than the fourth quarter of 
2020. These adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive 
macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions 
outlined below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rate near 7% into the first quarter of 2022 and falling below 6% in the third quarter of 2022, and a 
weighted average cumulative change in U.S. gross domestic 
product ("GDP") of 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022 .
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows : 
Assumptions at September 30, 2021
4Q21 2Q22 4Q22
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 5.1 %  4.4 %  4.1 %
Cumulative change in U.S. real

Cumulative change in U.S. real

(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates 
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future 
periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held non-traded financial 
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. 
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended 
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for 
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, 
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $593.0 billion , and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 44-46  and Note 9 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 78-82  for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
54-58  for further information on related liquidity risk.Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-
traded financial instruments representing ownership 
interests or other forms of junior capital and span multiple 
asset classes. These investments are made by dedicated 
investing businesses or as part of a broader business 
strategy. In general, principal investments include tax-
oriented investments and investments made to enhance or 
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those 
that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. The 
Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in line with its 
strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support 
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.  
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the 
principal investment portfolios have not been significantly 
affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of 
the principal investment portfolios as S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 135–142  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities 
that give rise to market risk. 
Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures 
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 85 .
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time.  Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”),  a statistical 
risk measure , to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.  
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events.  The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.
Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K 
for further information regarding VaR, including the 
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,  for 
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR decreased by $7 million  for the three 
months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 when compared with 
June 30, 2021. This was due to volatility rolling out of the 
one-year historical look-back period impacting exposures in 
commodities, as well as risk reductions  in equities.Year over year results
Average total VaR decreased by $54 million  for the three 
months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, compared with the 
same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by 
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical look-back 
period, predominantly impacting exposures in fixed income 
and commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. As noted previously, average total VaR 
decreased by $54 million  for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the same period in the prior year. 
Daily Risk Management VaR has returned to pre-pandemic levels, as the volatility which occurred in late March of 2020 at the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled out of the one-year historical look-back period.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily  VaR model backtesting , which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the 
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of 
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income.  These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset 
backtesting gains and losses on a particular day.  The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
For the 12 months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 157 of the 259 days, and observed eight 
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 44 of the 
66 days, and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions.
The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding 
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point 
intervals.  A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily  Risk Management VaR for the prior 
day. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent.  The results in the 
chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s  Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and 
issuing debt as well as from the investment securities 
portfolio.  Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.
One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk 
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures  as described on page 
136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:
•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any 
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts do not currently include assumptions to 
account for the reversal of Quantitative Easing in the 12-
month horizon for earnings-at-risk.
•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ 
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and 
other factors.The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 8  for additional information).

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets 
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.
Based upon current and implied market rates as of 
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, scenarios reflecting lower rates could 
result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never 
experienced an interest rate environment where the 
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. In a 
negative interest rate environment, the modeling 
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require 
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual 
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net 
revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to 
the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, as the movement in market 
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these 
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.
Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries.
Refer to pages 143-144  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.
Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
their comparative exposures as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows.
The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased 
cash placements with the central bank of Australia  in the 
first quarter of 2021, predominantly driven by client 
activity following policy dec isions in the country and growth 
in client deposit s.Top 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.)(a)

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems; Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates.  Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147  of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 
148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk 
Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples 
of operational risks are provided below.
Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected 
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism 
and health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees 
and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide 
resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover 
its critical business functions and supporting assets (e.g., 
people, technology, data and facilities) in the event of a 
business interruption. The program includes governance, 
awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as 
well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, 
and manage business interruption and public safety risks. 
The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency 
program has played an integral role in maintaining the 
Firm’s business operations during and after various events.Cybersecurity Risk
Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the Firm continues 
to leverage use of remote access and video conferencing 
solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote 
work. As a result, the Firm has deployed additional 
precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.
Payment Fraud Risk
The risk of payment fraud has normalized since the 
heightened levels experienced during earlier stages of the 
COVID-19 pandemic . The Firm continues to  employ various 
controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as 
providing employee and client education and awareness 
trainings. 
84
ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.
The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- 
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
and making business decisions.
While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly 
different from the historical macroeconomic environments 
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than 
in typical periods.   
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 86-88  and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations 
and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorgan Chase ’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),
•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and
•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for further information on these 
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies 
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; 
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 75-76  and 
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across 
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily 
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific 
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled 
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.
•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices 
and HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market 
and weak overall economic conditions that affected 
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale 
lending portfolios. 
The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the 
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook , particular ly in the adverse 
scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including the 
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may 
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of 
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government 
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in 
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on 
certain sectors. J udgment is still required to estimate the 
speed and trajectory of the economic recovery. 
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 
approximately 2.3% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, 
with a peak difference of approximately 3.7% in the first 
quarter of 202 2; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower 
recovery, remaining nearly 2.7% lower at the end of the 
86
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 5.9% in the first quarter of 2022; and l ower 
national HPI with a peak difference of nearly 14.4% and 
forecasted trough, both in the first quarter of 2023.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:
•the Firm continues to place meaningful weighting on its 
adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit 
losses as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and accordingly, the 
existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond 
those estimated under the central scenario
•the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables
•the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in 
the Firm's allowance estimate, which has created 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimations 
•significant changes in the expected severity and duration 
of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, effects of government support and customer 
assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent 
recovery  could significantly affect the Fi rm’s estimate of 
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated 
sensitivities describ ed below.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the 
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering the additional weight the Firm has placed on its 
adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated 
effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s 
allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures, the 
comparison between these two scenarios reflects the 
following differences:
•An increase of approximately $350 million  for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments
•An increase of approximately $2.6 billion  for credit card 
loans
•An increase of approximately $2.1 billion  for wholesale 
loans and lending-related commitments 
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1.
Fair value  
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for

based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The 
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including 
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more 
significant than those required when estimating the fair 
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.Goodwill impairment

goodwill for impairment. Refer  to Goodwill impairment on 
page 154  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.

including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1.
Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $9.4 billion  and $7.7 
billion  at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase  
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards 
points earned on accelerated spend and promotional offers 
outpacing redemptions throughout 2021, and to a lesser 
extent adjustments to redemption rate assumptions . Refer 
to page 154  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, 
associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021
Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements
Reference Rate
Reform
Issued March
2020 and 
updated 
January 2021•Provides optional expedients and exceptions to 
current accounting guidance when financial 
instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and 
other transactions are amended due to reference 
rate reform.
•Provides an election to account for certain 
contract amendments related to reference rate 
reform as modifications rather than 
extinguishments without the requirement to 
assess the significance of the amendments.  
•Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge 
accounting relationship without automatic 
termination of that relationship. Provides various 
practical expedients and elections designed to 
allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted 
during the transition period.  
•Provides a one-time election to transfer securities 
out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain 
criteria are met.
•The January 2021 update provides an election to 
account for derivatives modified to change the 
rate used for discounting, margining, or contract 
price alignment (collectively “discounting 
transition”) as modifications. •Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 
7, 2021 update was effective when issued. 
•The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical 
expedients related to contract modifications and 
hedge accounting relationships, and discounting 
transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. 
The discounting transition election was applied 
retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical 
expedients is to ease the administrative burden of 
accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate 
reform. These elections did not have a material 
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
89
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-
looking statements. These statements can be identified by the 
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current 
facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as 
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” 
“goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-
looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current 
expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, 
results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this 
Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the 
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in 
its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In 
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-
looking statements orally to investors, analysts, 
representatives of the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to 
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm’s 
control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may differ 
materially from those set forth in its forward-looking 
statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks 
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in

COVID-19 pandemic;

conditions and geopolitical events;
•Changes in laws and regulatory requirements, including 
capital and liquidity requirements affecting the Firm’s

environment;•Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its 
counterparties or competitors;
•The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;
•Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue products and 
services, and the extent to which products or services 
previously sold by the Firm require the Firm to incur 
liabilities or absorb losses not contemplated at their 
initiation or origination; 
•Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products and 
services by the marketplace and the ability of the Firm to 
innovate and to increase market share;
•Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified and 
diverse employees;
•Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

over financial reporting;

diseases, pandemics or outbreaks of hostilities, or the 
effects of climate change, and the Firm’s ability to deal 
effectively with disruptions caused by the foregoing;
•Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its financial, 
accounting, technology, data processing and other 
operational systems and facilities;
•Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that may be

Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and JPMorgan 
Chase does not undertake to update any forward-looking 
statements. The reader should, however, consult any further 
disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firm may make in 
any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly 
Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Chase  and its subsidiaries conform to  U.S. GAAP. 
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by 
regulatory authorities.  
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared 
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual 
results could be different from these estimates. In the 
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments 
have been included such that this interim financial 
information is fairly stated.
These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should 
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated 
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in  
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020 Form 10-K.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been 
reclassified to conform with the current presentation,  
including certain deferred investment tax credits.  In the 
first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred 
investment tax credits from accounts payable and other 
liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying 
value of the associated tax-oriented investments. The 
reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax 
expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with 
no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been 
revised to conform with the current presentation, including  
the Firm’s effective income tax rate.  The reclassification did 
not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed 
basis.Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which  the Firm has 
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
balances and transactions  have been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  
the Firm are not assets of  JPMorgan Chase and are not 
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial 
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is 
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  
Refer to Notes  1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form  
10-K for a further description of  JPMorgan Chase’s 
accounting policies regarding consolidation.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables 
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the 
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net 
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP 
also permits securities financing activities to be presented 
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including 
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting 
agreement.  The Firm has elected to net such balances when 
the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note  1 of 
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020 Form 10-K  for further information 
on offsetting assets and liabilities.   
Income tax expense
The Firm’s effective tax rate was 17.2%  and 19.1%  for the 
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, 
respectively , and 19.8%  and 17.7%  for the three and nine 
months ended September 30, 2020, respectively . The 
effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended 
September 30, 2021 reflects the recognition of an income 
tax benefit of $ 5 6 6   m i l l i o n related to finalizing the Firm’s 
2020 U.S. federal tax return, which reduced the Firm’s 
effective tax rate by 4.0%  and 1.2%  respectively . The tax 
benefit included state and local impacts of federal tax 
method changes and a reduction in the valuation allowance 
for U.S. foreign tax credits . Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information.

mortgage-related.
(b)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. 
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not 
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities 
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further 
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have 
been included in each period presented.

(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).

classified in the fair value hierarchy. At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge 
funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $813 million  and $670 million , respectively. Included in these balances at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  
2021 , and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, were trading assets of $56 million  and $52 million , respectively, and other assets of $757 million  and $618 million , 
respectively.
(e)At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, included $27.2 billion  and $15.1 billion , respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $8.1 
billion  and $6.3 billion , respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with 
the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $13.1 billion  and $8.4 billion , respectively.
(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid 
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit 
associated with cash collatera l.
(g)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Level 3 valuations 
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
further information on the  Firm’s valuation process and a 
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for 
individual financial instruments.  
The following table presents the  Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the 
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for 
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of 
such inputs.  While the determination to classify an 
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the 
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, 
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable 
components (that is, components that are actively quoted 
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the 
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs 
are not included in the table. In addition, the  Firm manages 
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial 
instruments using securities and derivative positions that 
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The range of values presented in the table is representative 
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the 
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted 
averages of the input values presented in the table are 
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that 
the input is being used to value.  
In the  Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic 
average values do not reflect the degree of input 
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the  
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the 
characteristics of the various instruments held by  the Firm 
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range 
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation 
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied 
volatility levels because the option contracts have different 
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and 
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by the  Firm at each 
balance sheet date.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued 
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $299 million , nonagency securities of $24 million  and non-trading loans of $838 million .
(c)Comprises nonagency securities of $19 million , trading loans of $41 million  and non-trading loans of $420 million .
(d)Comprises trading loans of $941  million and non-trading loans of $813  million.
(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain 
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The 
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f)Includes equity securities of $1.0 billion  including $379 million  in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is 
generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant 
both individually and in aggregate.
(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-
based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100 .
(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i)Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K f or a 
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in 
unobservable inputs and the relationships between 
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of 
the underlying instruments and external market factors that 
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the  Firm’s 
positions.  
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the 
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in 
fair value) for financial instruments classified by  the Firm 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the  three and 
nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . When a 
determination is made to classify a financial instrument 
within level 3, the determination is based on the 
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair 
value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments 
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 
components, observable components (that is, components 
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external 
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table 
below include changes in fair value due in part to 
observable factors that are part of the valuation 
methodology. Also,  the Firm risk-manages the observable 
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities 
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 
risk management instruments are not included below, the 
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the 
effect of  the Firm’s risk management activities related to 
such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis 
Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets 
since  December 31, 2020, for those items measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on  page 109 
for further information on changes impacting items 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 
Level 3 assets were $17.1 billion  at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, 
reflecting an increase of $1.2 billion  from June 30, 2021 
and an increase of $697 million  from December 31, 2020.
The increase for the three months ended September 30, 
2021 was largely driven by an $ 8 0 2   m i l l i o n increase in 
MSRs. 
The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 
2021 was predominantly driven b y:
•a $ 2 . 1   b i l l i o n increase in MSRs.
    partially offset by
•$ 4 4 4   m i l l i o n decrease in gross interest rate derivative 
receivables due to settlements net of gains and 
$ 4 4 3   m i l l i o n decrease in gross equity derivative 
receivables due to settlements and transfer s net of gains.

nonrecurring basis as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, $1.1 billion  related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity 
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.
(b)Of the $314 million  in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, $208 million  related to residential real 
estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as 
they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s 
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 12%  to 45%  with a weighted average of 25% .

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or 
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in 
other income.  
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes,  the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed 
necessary to arrive at  the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different 
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with  the Firm’s valuation techniques for 
private equity direct investments.  
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of  
September 30, 2021 and 2020 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded 
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the 
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, 
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and 
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying 
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected 
life.  The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including 
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 
The majority of  the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,  the Firm 
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without 
notice. Refer to  page 173  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related 
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option 
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, 
financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.  
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement 
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that 
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted 
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.  
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:  
•Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed 
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments  
•Certain securities financing agreements  
•Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise 
be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument  
•Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives that are issued as part 
of client-driven activities  
•Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by  CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are 
carried at fair value  
Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the  three and nine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss 
information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related

(c)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected 
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for 
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors 
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. 
(d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if 
applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients 
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk 
exposures. Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the  Firm’s use of and 
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.  
The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting 
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited 
number of  the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the 
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net 
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge 
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are 
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and 
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as 
derivatives used in  the Firm’s market-making businesses or 
for other purposes.
The following table outlines  the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure 
category.

the notional amounts significantly exceed, in  the Firm’s 
view, the possible losses that could arise from such

Derivatives netting  
The following tables present, as of  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, gross and net derivative receivables and 
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the 
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where  the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal 
opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, 
amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are 
shown separately in the tables below.  
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and 
payables,  the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate 
counterparty credit risk associated with  the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure 
amount . For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality 
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
•the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of 
the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and  
•collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not 
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of  JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries , predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered 
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be 
triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a 
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in 
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), 
nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the 
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset  
In certain instances  the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure 
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The 
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note  10, but in limited 
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers 
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.

securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b)Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net 
interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate 
swaps and the related hedged items.
(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses 
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were 
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net 
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. 
(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward 
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis sprea ds. Excluded components may impact earnings either through 
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-
currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus 
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income 
in future periods.
(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not 
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the carrying amount excluded for AFS 
securities is $12.6 billion  and $14.5 billion , respectively, and for long-term debt is $11.8 billion  and $6.6 billion , respectively.
(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
(d)Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value 
hedging relationships.
(e)Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive

(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of no n-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of 
gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.  
The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the  three and nine months ended  September 
30, 2021 and 2020 .
Over the next 12 months,  the Firm expects that approximately  $812 million  (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been 
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is 
approximately  eight years , corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.  For open cash flow 
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately  seven years . The Firm’s 
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

(b)Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. The amount reclassified for the three and nine months 
ended September 30, 2021 was not material. During the nine months en ded September 30, 2020, the Firm reclassified pre-tax losses of $ 8   m i l l i o n to 
other income related to the liquidation of certain legal entities and the amount was not material for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Refer 
to Note 19 for further information.
Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk 
management purposes

activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in 
principal transactions revenue.
(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains 
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making 
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the 
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain 
risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not 
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk 
management categories above are included in this 
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are 
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer 
to Note  5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables 
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the  Firm sold and purchased as of  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary 
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of 
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic 
hedges, each of which reduces, in  the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. 
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. 
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual 
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt 
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b)Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years  or more, based on contractual maturity. The 
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years  for agency residential MBS, 4 years  for agency 
residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years  for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note  11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for 
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities 
financing activities. Refer to Note  3 for further information 
regarding securities borrowed and securities lending 
agreements for which the fair value option has been 
elected. Refer to Note  23 for further information regarding 
assets pledged and collateral received in securities 
financing agreements.
The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of  
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. When  the 
Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect 
to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and 
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are 
met,  the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the 
balances outstanding under its securities financing 
agreements with the same counterparty. In addition,  the 
Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its 
counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net 
Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where  the Firm 
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to 
the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, 
along with securities financing balances that do not meet all 
these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is 
presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on 
the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net 
amounts” presented.  Where a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances 
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.  In 
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
secu rities-for-securities  lending agreement and receives 
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm 
recognizes the securities received a t fair value within other 
assets and the obligation to return those securities within 
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets.

At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the Firm held $484 million  and $598 million , respectively,  of financial 
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are 
recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan.  The Firm accounts for loans based on the following 
categories:
•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
•Loans held-for-sale
•Loans at fair value
Refer to Note  12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer 
to Note  3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on  the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. 
Refer to Note  2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.  
Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into  three  portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the  Firm to determine 
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the  
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.  
Consumer, excluding 
credit cardCredit card Wholesale(c)(d)
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)• Credit card loans • Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)
(a)Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM,  and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and  Corporate .
(b)Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer loans for which the 
wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d)The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, 
purpose, and type of borrower.
(e)Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to 
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for 
more information on SPEs.
The following tables summarize  the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

2020 . The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance 
with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.
(c)Excludes purchases of retained loans of $7.3 billion  and $3.1 billion  for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively, and $19.3 
billion  and $10.5 billion  for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the 
correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.
Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related 
commitments (including adjustments to record loans and 
lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of 
cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the 
three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 was 
$31 million  and $225 million , respectively, of which 
$ 3 0   m i l l i o n and $ 2 1 1   m i l l i o n, respectively, related to 
loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-
related commitments for the three and nine months ended 
September 30, 2020 was $113 million  and $(75) million , 
respectively, of which $ 2 4   m i l l i o n and $ ( 7 6 )   m i l l i o n, 
respectively, related to loans.  In addition, the sale of loans 
may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the 
allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.Loan modifications
The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. 
The majority of  the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan 
modifications have not been considered TDRs because:  
•they represent short-term or other insignificant 
modifications, whether under  the Firm’s regular loan 
modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory 
guidance, or  
•the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the 
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided 
by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act.
To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of 
the above criteria,  the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.   
As permitted by regulatory guidance,  the Firm does not 
place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on 
nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise 
reportable as nonaccrual.  The Firm considers expected 
losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all 
COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for 
credit losses.  
Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual 
status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would 
have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.
138
Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equit y 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, 
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. 
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by 
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only 
payment period and certain payment-option loans that may 
result in negative amortization.

consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
(c)At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $31

(d)Purchased loans are included in the y ear in which they were originated.
(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Approximately  36%  of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien 
position the  Firm holds is considered in the  Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to 
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the 
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available 
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, 
in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower 
(“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately 7% of Chapter 7 
residential real estate loans were 30 days  or more past due.
(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-
dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying 
collateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.
(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $41 million  and $39 million  and $127 million  and $119 million  for the three and nine 
months ended S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively.
(d)Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes  loans to customers that have exited 
COVID-19 payment related  deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of 
exit.
(e)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is 
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not 
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.
(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a 
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent 
available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien 
positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(i)Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(j)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1.
(k)At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $72 million  and $76 million , respectively . 
These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the  Firm 
grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported 
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions are not 
TDRs nor are loans for which  the Firm has elected to apply 
the option to suspend the application of accounting 
guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and 
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The 
carrying value of new TDRs was  $116 million  and $199 
million  for the  three months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 
and 2020 , respectively , and $674 million  and $537 million  
for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , 
respectively . There were no additional commitments to lend 
to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been 
modified in TDRs.  Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, 
generally provide various concessions to financially 
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest 
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of 
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise 
have been required under the terms of the original 
agreement.  The following table provides information about 
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs 
under the  Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above 
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of 
debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions, and 
loans for which  the Firm has elected to apply the option to 
suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as 
provided by the CARES Act and extended by the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act.

Financial effects of modifica tions and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of 
residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans 
modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications 
and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter  7 loans where 
the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not 
considered concessions, and loans for which  the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting 
guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred 
within one year  of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such 
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments 
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. 
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months  may no t be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified 
in TDRs were  four years . The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and 
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).  
Active and suspended foreclosure
At S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. 
government agencies, with a carrying value of  $693 million  and $846 million , respectively, that were not included in REO, but 
were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,  the Firm has temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This could delay 
recognition of foreclosed properties until the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification 
programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers 
who are experiencing financial difficulty. The  Firm grants 
concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-
term programs. These modifications involve placing the 
customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for  60 months, 
and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit 
card. Substantially all modifications under the  Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with 
short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not 
considered concessions are not TDRs.  
If the cardholder does not comply with the modified 
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age 
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with  the 
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases,  the Firm 
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial 
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans

consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified 
credit card loans remain in the modification program and 
continue to be charged off in accordance with the  Firm’s 
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to 
small businesses and high-net-worth individuals.  The 
primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating  assigned to each loan. Refer to Note  12 
of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for further 
information on these risk ratings .

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as 
they provide various concessions to borrowers who are 
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or 
other insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which  the Firm 
has elected to apply the option to suspend the application 
of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES 
Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. 
The carrying value of TDRs was  $928 million  and 
$ 9 5 4   m i l l i o n as of  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and December 31, 
2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was  
$180 million  and $ 1 8 8   m i l l i o n for the  three  months ended 
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively,  and 
$ 8 3 2   m i l l i o n and $ 3 5 2   m i l l i o n for the nine months ended  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively. New  TDRs for 
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 
reflected deferral of principal and interest payments, 
extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial 
satisfaction of the loan predominantly in Other and 
Commercial and Industrial loan classes.  The impact of 
these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material 
to the Firm for the  three and nine months ended  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The a llowance for credit losses as of S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 
was $20.5 billion , a decrease from $30.8 billion  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The decrease in the allowance for 
credit losses reflected:
•an $8.0 billion  reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and
•a $2.3 billion  net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many  MEVs used in 
the Firm's allowance estimate which has created challenges 
in the use of modeled credit loss estimates, increased the 
reliance on management judgment, and resulted in 
adjustments to appropriately address the economic 
circumstances.  These adjustments continued through the 
third quarter of 2021, although to a lesser extent than 
experienced during 2020 .
The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the 
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic outlook , particularly in the adverse 
scenarios.  However, uncertainties remain, including  the 
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may 
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of 
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government 
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in 
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on 
certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm 
retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in 
the third quarter of 2021, in line with the second quarter of 
2021, but to a lesser extent than the fourth quarter of 
2020. These adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive 
macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions 
outlined below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rate near 7% into the first quarter of 2022 
and falling below 6% in the third quarter of 2022, and a 
weighted average cumulative change in U.S. GDP of 3.8% in 
the fourth quarter of 2022 .The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows : 
Assumptions at September 30, 2021
4Q21 2Q22 4Q22
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 5.1 %  4.4 %  4.1 %
Cumulative change in U.S. real 
GDP from 12/31/2019  3.3 %  5.0 %  6.2 %
Assumptions at December 31, 2020

Cumulative change in U.S. real 
GDP from 12/31/2019  (1.9) %  0.6 %  2.0 %
(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates 
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future 
periods.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal 
amount of assets held in  Firm-sponsored private-label 
securitization entities, including those in which  the Firm has 
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by  
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the 
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests 
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, 
and derivative contracts. In certain instances,  the Firm’s 
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The  
Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and 
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

In the normal course of business,  JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.  The Firm held 
$12.5 billion  and $13.5 billion  of the commercial paper 
issued by  the Firm -administered multi-seller conduits at  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
respectively,  which have been eliminated in consolidation.  
The Firm’s investments reflect  the Firm’s funding needs and 
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.  Other 
than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules,  the Firm is not obligated under any 
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and 
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been 
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related 
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were  
$12.5 billion  and $12.2 billion  at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively,  and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other 
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note  22 
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments.  
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are 
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB 
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.  
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB 
transactions.

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, 
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”.  The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of 
JPMorgan Chase . Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $2.7 billion  and $5.2 billion  at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, 
and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively. 
(f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by 
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a 
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider , investor , 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee 
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the 
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying assets. Where  the Firm does not 
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a 
variable interest that could potentially be significant,  the 
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance 
sheets in the same manner it would record and report 
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.  
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm  holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit 
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities 
that own and operate affordable housing , energy, and other  
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A 
third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the 
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly  the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles.  The Firm generally invests in 
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the 
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by 
equity investments and funding commitments, was  $24.7 
billion  and $23.6 billion , of which  $8.6 billion  and $8.7 
billion  was unfunded at  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively.  The prior-period 
maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to 
conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses 
each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold 
varying amounts of its capital investment until the project 
qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note  25 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for further information on 
affordable housing tax credits  and Note 22 of this Form 10-
Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments.  
158
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB 
trusts, including  remarketing agent, liquidity or tender 
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,  the 
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a 
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.  
In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,  
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders 
for any shortfall.  The Firm does not have any intent to 
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the 
underlying municipal bonds.  The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since  the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.  The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to 
customer TOB trusts at   S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 was $6.9 billion  and $6.7 billion , 
respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 was $10.6 
billion  and $10.5 billion , respectively.  
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, 
and commercial mortgages.
Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to  the Firm’s securitization activities for the  three and nine months ended  
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , related to assets held in Firm -sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by  
the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored 
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to 
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization 
activity tables above,  the Firm, in the normal course of 
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans 
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, 
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs 
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the 
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans).  The Firm also sells loans 
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae 
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed 
by another U.S. government agency.  The Firm does not 
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these 
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a 
limited number of loan sales,  the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note  22 of this Form 10-Q for 
additional information about  the Firm’s loan sales- and 
securitization-related indemnifications and Note  14 for 
additional information about the impact of  the Firm ’s sale

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to  the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain 
loans due to material breaches of representations and 
warranties as discussed in Note  22, the Firm also has the 
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government 
agencies under certain arrangements . The Firm typically 
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan 
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the 
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable 
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or 
guaranteed. When  the Firm’s  repurchase option becomes 
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding 
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.  
The following table presents loans  the Firm repurchased or 
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and

(b)Primarily foreign currency adjustments and adjustments to goodwill 
related to prior period acquisitions.Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter 
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or 
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business 
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.  Refer to 
Note  15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of  the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing .
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases 
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse 
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the 
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated 
fair values of the  Firm’s reporting units to decline in the 
future, which could result in a material impairment charge 
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill.  
As of  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm reviewed current 
economic conditions, including the potential impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on business performance, estimated 
market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and 
projections of business performance . The Firm has 
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of 
S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, or D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, nor was 
goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 or 2020 .
161
Mortgage servicing right s
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value 
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally 
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing 
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage 
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Note s 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for a further description of the 
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.  
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the  three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .

advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right 
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if 
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements .

generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the 
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change 
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be 
linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular 
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without 
changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one 
factor may result in changes in another, which would either 
magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

Note 21 – Regulatory capita l 
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized requirements, for the 
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC 
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and 
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. 
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines 
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to 
maintain minimum ratios  for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, 
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR . Failure to meet 
these minimum requirements  could cause the Federal 
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to 
these capital requirements  established by their respective 
primary regulators.  
The following table presents the minimum and well-
capitalized risk-based ratios to which the Firm and its IDI 
subsidiaries were subject as of  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.

CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios each include a 
respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of  3.5%  as 
calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.3%  SCB for Basel III Standardized 
ratios and  a fixed  2.5%  capital conservation buffer for Basel III 
Advanced ratios.  The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by 
the federal banking agencies.
(b)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The 
CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a fixed 
capital conservation buffer requirement of  2.5%  that is applicable to 
the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB 
surcharge.  
(c)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to 
regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.  
(d)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations

CECL regulatory capital transition delay
As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule 
that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to 
delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two 
years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning 
January 1, 2022 . 
The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended 
September 30, 2021, the capital metrics of  the Firm 
exclude $ 3 . 3   b i l l i o n, which is the $2.7 billion  day 1 impact 
to retained earnings and 25% of the $ 1 . 9   b i l l i o n increase 
in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 
(excluding allowances on PCD loans).   
The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have 
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, and total leverage exposure.  Refer to Note 27 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for further information 
on CECL capital transition provisions.

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and other 
commitments
JPMorgan Chase  provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address 
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The 
contractual amount of these financial instruments 
represents the maximum possible credit risk to  the Firm 
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment 
or the Firm  be required to fulfill its obligation under the 
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most 
of these commitments and guarantees have historically 
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total 
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in  the 
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit 
exposure or funding requirements.  Refer to Note  28 of 
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for a further discussion 
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the  
Firm’s related accounting policies.  
To provide for expected  credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 
is maintained. Refer to Note  12 for further information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments .The following table summarizes the contractual amounts 
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments 
at S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The 
amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and 
certain scored business banking lending-related 
commitments represent the total available credit for these 
products.  The Firm has not experienced, and does not 
anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these 
products will be utilized at the same time.  The Firm can 
reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business 
banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, 
in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In 
addition,  the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the 
borrower is  60 days  or more past due.  The Firm may reduce 
or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the 
value of the underlying property, or when there has been a 
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the 
borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally 
consist of commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support 
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event 
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new 
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing 
organizations.  The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in 
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of 
credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are 
conditional lending commitments issued by  the Firm to 
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a 
173
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial 
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, 
trade financings and similar transactions.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have 
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to 
Note  28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for further 
information on these derivatives.  
The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying 
as guarantees as of  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, and

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee,  the Firm is both a purchaser 
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives 
market. Refer to Note  4 for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives.  Merchant charge-backs   
Under the rules of payment networks,  the Firm, in its role as 
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for 
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that 
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is 
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will 
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the 
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the 
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable 
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services 
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the 
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by 
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve 
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant 
Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the 
payment or performance risk to  the Firm related to charge-
backs.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with  the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with GSEs  the Firm has made 
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet 
certain requirements, and that may require  the Firm to 
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan 
purchaser if such representations and warranties are 
breached by  the Firm. 
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with 
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the  
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note  24 
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.  
Sponsored member repo program  
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the 
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing 
Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become 
sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The  Firm also 
guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and 
performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective 
obligations under the FICC’s rules. The  Firm minimizes its 
liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities 
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house 
therefore the  Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The  
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into 
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the 
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments 
line on  page 173 . Refer to Note  11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020  Form 10-K  for additional information on credit risk 
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of 
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.  
Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt 
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan 
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100% -owned 
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and 
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees 
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity 
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 173  of 
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 
10-K for additional information.Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note  29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for 
a discussion of the  Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.  
Pledged assets 
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain 
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with 
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and 
FHLBs. Additionally, the  Firm pledges assets for other 
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other 
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to 
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits . Certain of 
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise 
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically 
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets 
pledged.

Collateral 
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is 
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This 
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other 
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related 
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative 
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and 
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales 
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of September 30, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries 
and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous 
legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, 
government investigations or regulatory enforcement 
matters. The litigations range from individual actions 
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with 
potentially millions of class members. Investigations and 
regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and 
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and 
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are 
at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or 
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of 
business and several geographies and a wide variety of 
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and 
statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection 
claims), some of which present novel legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.5 billion  at September 30, 2021. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
was based upon information available as of that date for 
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an 
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For 
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an 
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate 
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
involves significant judgment, given:
•the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
•the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability 
(if any) has yet to be determined, 
•the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
•the attendant uncertainty of the various potential 
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm 
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the 
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or 
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, 
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be 
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may 
vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal 
proceedings.
Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in 
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by 
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase 
entities into residential housing projects developed by the 
A m r a p a l i  G r o u p  ( “ A m r a p a l i ” ) .   I n  2 0 1 7 ,  n u m e r o u s  c r e d i t o r s  
filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions 
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or 
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ 
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India 
and is ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order 
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately 
$31.5 million . The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. 
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued 
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and 
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities 
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, 
violated certain currency control and money laundering 
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry 
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) 
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”).  In May 
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million  from J.P. 
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the 
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and 
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.   
Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the 
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major 
international oil companies. The account held 
approximately $1.1 billion  in connection with a dispute 
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the 
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid 
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in 
accordance with directions received from its clients. In 
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) 
commenced a claim in the English High Court for 
approximately $875 million  in payments made out of the 
accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the 
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a 
complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but 
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on 
notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was 
unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been 
scheduled to commence in February 2022.
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm 
previously reported settlements with certain government 
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and 
trading activities and controls related to those activities. 
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In 
January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment 
176
entered thereafter and a term of probation which ended in 
January 2020, with the Firm remaining in good standing 
throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor 
granted the Firm a five-year  exemption of disqualification 
that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on 
the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) 
until January 2023. The Firm will need the Department of 
Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the 
remainder of the ten-year  disqualification period. A South 
Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-
related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending 
before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.
In August 2018, the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York granted final approval to the 
Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by 
U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of 
federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to 
manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought 
damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures 
and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement 
class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the 
class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm 
and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A 
number of these actions remain pending. Further, a 
putative class action has been filed against the Firm and 
other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain 
consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly 
inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought 
against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on 
behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. 
In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 
11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $10 
million . In addition, some FX-related individual and putative 
class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct 
have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, 
Brazil and Australia.
Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . The Firm 
has been responding to requests for information and other 
material from certain of its regulators concerning its 
compliance with records preservation requirements in 
connection with business communications sent over 
electronic messaging channels that have not been approved 
by the Firm.  The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries 
and is currently engaged in certain advanced resolution 
discussions. There is no assurance that the discussions will 
result in a resolution.
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging 
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, 
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card 
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of 
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases 
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card 
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card 
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that 
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York for further proceedings consistent with the 
appellate decision.
The original class action was divided into two separate 
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other 
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the 
parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized 
an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior 
settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the 
defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 
million  to the approximately $5.3 billion  previously held in 
escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, 
the amended agreement was approved by the District 
Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s 
approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on 
the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended 
class settlement, $700 million  has been returned to the 
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with 
the settlement agreement. The class action seeking 
primarily injunctive relief continues separately, and in 
September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ 
motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion 
in part.
In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as 
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those 
actions remain pending.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 
various governmental agencies and entities around the 
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s 
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for 
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s 
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss 
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to 
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, 
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission 
issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding 
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to 
EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with 
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along 
with other banks in various individual and putative class 
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar 
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the 
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has 
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain 
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims 
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the 
defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative 
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was 
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District 
Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm,  
to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have 
177
appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual 
plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging 
that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an 
unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired 
to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans 
and credit cards. In November 2020 and May 2021, 
plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction each 
seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR 
and to prohibit defendants from enforcing any financial 
instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The court held a 
hearing to address these motions in September 2021. The 
Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss 
franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the 
Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill 
Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.
Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and 
Related Inquiries.  The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions 
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, 
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective 
investigations relating to historical trading practices by 
former employees in the precious metals and U.S. 
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 
2016.
The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a 
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with 
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain 
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms 
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after 
three years , provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully 
comply with all of their obligations. 
Across the three  resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary 
amount of approximately $ 9 2 0   m i l l i o n. A portion of the 
total monetary amount includes victim compensation 
payments.
Several putative class action complaints have been filed in 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York against the Firm and certain former employees, 
alleging a precious metals futures and options price 
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity 
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust 
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the 
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court 
consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, 
and the consolidated action is stayed through December 
2021. In July 2021, the parties informed the Court that 
they have entered into a settlement to resolve the action. In 
Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class 
action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative 
class actions were filed in the United States District Courts 
for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of 
New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. 
Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the 
Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also 
allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern 
District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern 
District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative 
class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their 
consolidated amended complaint in April 2021. In May 
2021, the parties informed the Court that they have 
entered into a settlement to resolve the action.
In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were 
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New 
York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on 
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the 
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the 
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not 
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these 
putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their 
second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally 
alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures 
contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during 
the putative class period were materially false and 
misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.  
Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, 
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are 
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York.  The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust 
law and New York State common law in connection with an 
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous 
exchange trading for securities lending transactions. 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. 
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which 
defendants are opposing.
Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have 
been investigating a series of transactions entered into by 
senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) 
during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure 
their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 
Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a 
number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. cooperated with the investigation. The 
investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi  in 
November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to 
the French tribunal correctionnel  for alleged complicity in 
tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued 
a decision cancelling the mise en examen  of JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, 
ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen  is a 
prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi  and in January 
178
2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi 
referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal 
correctionnel . The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 
that it had no power to take further action against 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. following the Court of 
Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers 
of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel  
directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further 
investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., pending which the trial was postponed. In April 
2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of 
the tribunal correctionnel  at this stage of the proceedings. In 
August 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a 
Convention Judicaire d’Intérêt Public  with the French 
criminal authorities, under which it agreed to pay a fine of 
€25 million  to resolve the potential legal proceedings.  The 
resolution, which did not contain any admissions, was 
approved by the Presiding Judge of the tribunal judiciaire , 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid the fine in September 
2021. In addition, a number of the managers have 
commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different 
allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.
*     *     *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as 
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has 
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to 
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may 
be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with 
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm 
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its 
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its 
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $76 million  and 
$524 million  for the three months ended September 30, 
2021 and 2020 , respectively, and $289 million  and $839 
million  for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 
2020 . There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation 
reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome 
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek 
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters 
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of 
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot 
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of 
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase 
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial 
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the 
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no 
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently 
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among other 
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level 
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are 
determined based on the products and services provided, or 
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in 
which financial information is currently evaluated by the 
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented 
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and 
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of JPMorgan Chase ’s business segments.
Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
segment results as of or for the three and nine months 
ended  September 30, 2021 and 2020 , on a managed basis. 
The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the 
reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE 
basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the 
Firm’s managed basis. 
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the 
“Firm”) as of September 30, 2021, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
and changes in stockholders’ equity for the three-month 
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 
2020 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the 
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, 
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
“interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we 
are not aware of any material modifications that should be 
made to the accompanying interim financial statements for 
them to be in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of 
the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year 
then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated 
February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing 
a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on 
certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial 
statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those 
consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the 
information set forth in the accompanying consolidated 
balance sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is 
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the 
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.  Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Firm’s management.  We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB.  We conducted our review in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB.  A review of interim financial 
information consists principally of applying analytical 
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the 
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements 
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an 
opinion.

Client assets : Represent assets under management as well 
as custody, brokerage, administration and deposit accounts.
Client deposits and other third-party liabilities: Deposits, 
as well as deposits that are swept to on-balance sheet 
liabilities (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased 
and securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements) as part of client cash management programs. 
CLTV : Combined loan-to-value  
CMT:  Constant Maturity Treasury
Collateral-dependent : A loan is considered to be collateral-
dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be 
provided substantially through the operation or sale of the  
collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial 
difficulty, including when foreclosure is deemed probable 
based on borrower delinquency.  
Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment 
services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide 
through the commercial card products. Services include 
procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense 
management services, and business-to-business payment 
solutions.
Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value is 
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a 
third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one 
party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to 
another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence 
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, 
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its 
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the 
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the 
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to 
the protection seller for the difference between the face 
value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of 
settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as 
to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by 
the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.
Criticized : Criticized loans, lending-related commitments 
and derivative receivables that are classified as special 
mention, substandard and doubtful categories for 
regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a

criteria
Embedded derivatives:  are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of 
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner 
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms 
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of 
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid 
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument 
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the 
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a 
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, 
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a 
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio” : For residential real estate 
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between 
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of 
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.
Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination 
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual 
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the 
origination date.
Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current 
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated 
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home 
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area 
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist 
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data 
where actual data is not available. As a result, the 
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do 
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; 
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise 
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.
Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well 
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV 
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.
Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide 
financial results that includes reclassifications to present 
revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management 
also uses this financial measure at the segment level, 
because it believes this provides information to enable 
investors to understand the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the particular business segment 
and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with 
the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement:  A single agreement with a 
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed 
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and 
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the 
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a 
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral 
or margin when due).

without readily determinable fair values at cost less 
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes 
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

Mortgage product types :
Alt-A  
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A 
lending characteristics may include one or more of the 
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; 
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) 
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial 
proportion of  the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a 
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his 
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.
Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the 
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only 
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option 
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the 
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually 
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed 
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once 
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and 
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The 
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is 
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. 
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan 
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date 
triggers.
187
Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related 
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage 
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have 
reliable payment histories.
Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or 
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a 
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the 
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) 
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

sources of funds.
NFA:  National Futures Association
NM: Not meaningful
Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is not 
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status 
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and 
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more 
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of 
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically 
maintained on nonaccrual status.Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain 
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real 
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

total net revenue.
Parent Company:  JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: represents unvested share-based 
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, 
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share 
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase 
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees 
under its share-based compensation programs, which 
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the 
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested 
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under 
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and 
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock 
and participating securities, based on their respective rights 
to receive dividends.
PCD:  “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent 
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition 
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in 
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.

less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this 
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a 
lending institution to generate income in excess of its

188
Principal transactions revenue : Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer 
spread, which is the difference between the price at which  
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and 
the price at which  the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. 
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or 
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and 
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and 
losses on financial and other instruments (including those 
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in 
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity 
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities,  the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue 
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and 
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives 
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships 
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign 
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk 
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and 
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a 
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which 
include capital requirements for  credit risk, market risk, and 
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk.  Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally 
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced.

reference pool of loans or other market variables. The notes 
typically contain embedded (but not separable or 
detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for 
principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing 
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional 
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates 
or indexes.  
Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure 
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are 
currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss 
mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. 
Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, 
the total net revenue for each of the business segments and 
the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax

Global Funds:  clients include financial intermediaries and 
individual investors.
Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall 
fund performance:
Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services rank 
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over 
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and 
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the 
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating 
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is 
derived from a weighted average of the performance 
associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled 
funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual 
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on 
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with 
fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence 
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer 
192
categories and the asset values used to derive these 
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers 
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage 
of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for 
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for 
Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. 
The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not 
indicative of future results.
Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and 
five years):  All quartile rankings, the assigned peer 
categories and the asset values used to derive these 
rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. 
Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute 
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating 
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The 
percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and 
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and 
Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. 
The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not 
indicative of future results.
“Primary share class ” means the C share class for 
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and 
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the 
oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 
Market Risk.
Refer to the Market Risk Management section of 
Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 135–142  
of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for a discussion of 
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market 
risk.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an 
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with 
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial 
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, 
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls 
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of 
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, 
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all 
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls 
may occur from time to time, and there can be no 
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in 
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal 
control in the future and collateral consequences 
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal 
control over financial reporting” on page 158  of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for further information. There was 
no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, that has materially 
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.Part II – Other Information

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk
factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:
Risk Factors on pages 8-32  of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 
10-K . The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, 
sets forth the material risk factors that could affect 
JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. 
Readers should not consider any descriptions of such 
factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could 
affect the Firm.
Ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could harm 
the global economy and negatively affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s businesses. 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization 
declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus 
disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 
pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic, 
which included the institution of social distancing and 
shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. 
and other countries, have resulted in adverse impacts on 
global economic conditions, including:
• significant disruption and volatility in the financial 
markets 
• significant disruption of global supply chains, and 
• closures of many businesses, leading to loss of 
revenues and increased unemployment.  
The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic 
have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s 
businesses and results of operations, including:
• reduction in demand for certain products and services 
from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting 
in lower revenue, and
• increases in the allowance for credit losses.
Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with 
the determination of the allowance for credit losses have 
experienced heightened performance risk in the economic 
environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no 
assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to 
model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize 
unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that 
has resulted from these developments. 
Although global economic conditions have been improving 
despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, any 
ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the 
pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the 
pandemic, including as a result of additional waves or 
194
variants of the COVID-19 disease or the emergence of other 
diseases that have similar outcomes, could have significant 
adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of 
operations and financial condition, including:
• recognition of charge-offs and increases in the 
allowance for credit losses, including any delayed 
recognition of charge-offs  due to the impact of 
government stimulus actions or payment assistance 
provided to clients and customers 
• material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives 
and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase 
owns or in which it makes markets
• downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings
• constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels 
of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) 
related to supporting client activities, downgrades in 
client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, 
any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to 
take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise 
would under its liquidity and capital management 
strategies, and
• the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan 
Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, 
including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-
place arrangements, government actions or other 
restrictions in connection with the pandemic.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively 
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations 
and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and 
liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are 
uncertain and cannot be fully predicted, including: 
• the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic
• the availability, effectiveness and acceptance of 
vaccines
• actions taken by governmental authorities and other 
third parties in response to the pandemic, and
• the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or 
worsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of labor markets, 
particularly in light of the expiration of government 
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in 
consumer behavior that could have longer-term 
impacts on certain sectors. 
In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or 
indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or 
by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed 
to support individuals, households and businesses impacted 
by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase 
to:
• increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny
• negative publicity, and 
• increased exposure to litigation, 
any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s 
operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its 
reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic 
adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of 
operations and financial condition, it may also have the 
effect of heightening many of the other risks described in 
Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K. 
Supervision and regulation
Refer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 3–
7 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for information on 
Supervision and Regulation.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of 
Proceeds.  
The Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity 
securities during the three months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  
2021 . 
Repurchases under the common share repurchase 
program
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53  of this 
Form 10-Q and pages 91-101  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  
Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases under the 
Firm’s common share repurchase program.
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share 
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021.  Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized 
a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total  net repurchases and 
common stock dividends in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the 
Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.
On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire on 
June 30, 2021  as a result of the Firm remaining above its minimum risk-based capital requirements  under the 2021  CCAR 
stress test . Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the 
regulatory capital framework.  The Firm continues to be authorized to repurchase common shares under its existing common 
share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors.

Shares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r   3 0 ,  2 0 2 1,
