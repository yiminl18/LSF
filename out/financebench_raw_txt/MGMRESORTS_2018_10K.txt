Overview
 
MGM
 Resorts  International  is  a  Delaware  corporation  incorporated  in  1986  that  acts  largely  as  a  holding  company  and,  through  subsidiaries,  owns  andoperates integrated 
casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau. 
MGM
 Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company which completed its initial public offering in April 2016, is organized asan
 umbrella  partnership  REIT  (commonly  referred  to  as  an  UPREIT)  structure  in  which  substantially  all  of  its  assets  are  owned  by  and  substantially  all  of  itsbusinesses are
 conducted through MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). Pursuant to a master lease agreement between asubsidiary
 of  the  Company  (the  “tenant”)  and  a  subsidiary  of  the  Operating  Partnership  (the  “landlord”),  the  tenant  leases  the  real  estate  assets  of  The  Mirage,Mandalay
 Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM (which was branded as Monte Carlo prior to May 2018), Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGMGrand
 Detroit,  Beau  Rivage,  Borgata,  and  MGM  National  Harbor  from  the  landlord.  See  Note  1  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  forinformation
 regarding  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  which  we  consolidate  in  our  financial  statements,  and  Note  17  in  the  accompanying  consolidatedfinancial statements for informatio
n regarding the master lease with MGP. 
We
 believe  we  own  or  invest  in  several  of  the  finest  casino  resorts  in  the  world  and  we  continually  reinvest  in  our  resorts  to  maintain  our  competitiveadvantage.
 We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as othernew
 features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premierresorts in their respe
ctive markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. 
Business
Developments
 
In
 August  2016,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata,  at  which  time  Borgatabecame a consolidated subsidiary of
 ours. Subsequently, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from us.  In December 2016, we opened MGM National Harbor and,in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long
-term leasehold interest and real property associated with MGM National Harbor from us. 
In
 February 2018, we opened MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau, and in August 2018, we openedMGM Springfield in Springfield, Massa
chusetts. 
In
 July 2018, MGP completed its previously announced acquisition of the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohiolimited liability company that owns the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Roc
ksino Northfield Park from Milstein Entertainment LLC for a purchaseprice
 of approximately $1.1 billion (“Northfield Acquisition”). Simultaneously with the close of the transaction, MGP entered into a new agreement with an affiliateof Hard Rock Café Internationa
l (STP), Inc. to continue to serve as the manager of the property. 
In
 September  2018,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  with  MGP  to  acquire  all  of  the  operating  assets  of  Northfield  (“Northfield  OpCo”)  from  MGP  forapproximately
 $275  million,  subject  to  customary  purchase  price  adjustments.  Northfield  will  be  added  to  the  existing  master  lease  between  us  and  MGP.  Thetransaction is expect
ed to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. 
In
 December  2018,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  with  MGP  whereby  MGP  will  pay  us  consideration  of  approximately  $638  million  for  renovationsundertaken by us regarding the Park MGM and No
Mad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”). Additionally, at closing, the parties will enter intoan amendment to the exis
ting master lease. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. 
In
 January 2019, we completed our previously announced acquisition of the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's race track andcasino
 ("Empire City") for consideration of approximately $864 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. Subsequently, MGP acquiredEmpire City’s real prope
rty from us for fair value of consideration of1

 approximately
 $634 million. In connection with this transaction, we entered into an amendment to the existing master lease for our  subsidiary to lease back the realestate
 assets of Empire City from the landlord. In addition, pursuant to the master lease amendment, we agreed to provide MGP a right of first offer with respect tocertain undeveloped land 
adjacent to the property to the extent that we develop additional gaming facilities and choose to sell or transfer such property in the future. 
Resort
Operations
 
General
 
Most
 of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily onthe
 ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments,and repay debt financings.
 
Our
 results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing ofmajor conventions, the amoun
t and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, includingNew
 Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end
 gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and thefinancial health of 
customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. 
All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a
 day, every day of the year, with the exception of our newly acquired Empire City Casino which operates 20 hoursa
 day, every day of the year. At our domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be ownedand
 operated  by  us,  owned  by  us  but  managed  by  third  parties  for  a  fee,  or  leased  to  third  parties.  We  utilize  third-party  management  for  specific  expertise  inoperations of restauran
ts and nightclubs. We lease space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities. 
Las
Vegas
Strip
Resorts
and
Regional
Operations
Las

Vegas
Strip
Resorts.
At  December 31, 2018, our Las Vegas Strip Resorts consisted of the following casino resorts: Bellagio,  MGM Grand Las Vegas(including
 The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including the Park), Excalibur, ParkMGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus L
as Vegas.Regional
Operations.
At  December 31, 2018, our Regional Operations consisted of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan;Beau
 Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’sCounty, Maryland; and MGM Springfield in Spring
field, Massachusetts. 
Over
 half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and othernon-gaming
 amenities. We market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy andcustomer
 volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turnaffects the price we 
can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. 
Our
 casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge expe
riences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. 
MGM
China
 
We
 own  approximately  56%  of  MGM  China,  which  owns  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  S.A.  (“MGM  Grand  Paradise”),  the  Macau  company  that  owns  andoperates
 the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGMChina
 plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destinationin terms of revenue and we exp
ect future growth in the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. 
Our
 current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily fromgaming operations which are 
conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessionsand
 each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogos de Macau,S.A., and expires in 2020. The Macau g
overnment currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinosor
2

 gaming areas operated by 
the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require g overnment approval prior to commencing operations. 
Corporate
and
Other
 
We 
have  additional  business  activities  including  our  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  and  certain  other  corporate  and  management  operations,including MGP’s Northfield. CityCenter Hold
ings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.

Customers
and
Competition
 
Our casino
 resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the marketsin which we
 operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations competeto
 a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States andinternationally.
 For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business.” Weface
 significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure tocompete effectively could materially a
dversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.” 
Our primary methods of success
ful competition include: 
• Locating our resorts in desi rable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets; 
• Constructing  and  maintaining  high-quality  resorts  and  facilities,  including  luxurious  guestrooms,  state-of-the-art  convention  facilities  and  premierdining, entertainment, retail a
nd other amenities; 
• Recruiting, training and r etaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service; 
• Providing unique, “must-see” en tertainment attractions; and 
• Developing distinctive and m emorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

and
Regional
Operations
 
Our
 customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions,trade
 associations, and small meetings. We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure andvalue-oriented
 tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts duringmid-week and off-peak per
iods. 
Our
 Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on ornear the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the do
wntown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinoselsewhere in the
 Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recentlyexpanded
 their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside LasVegas has increased the comp
etition faced by our operations in Las Vegas. 
Outside
 Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, wherelocation is a criti
cal factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. 
MGM
China
 
The three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operati
ons.VIP
 gaming  play  is  sourced  both  internally  and  externally.  Externally  sourced  VIP  gaming  play  is  obtained  through  external  gaming  promoters  who  offer  VIPplayers
 various  services,  such  as  extension  of  credit  as  well  as  complimentary  hotel,  food  and  beverage  services.  Gaming  promoters  are  compensated  throughpayment
 of revenue-sharing  arrangements  and rolling chip turnover-based  commissions.  In-house VIP players also typically  receive  a commission  based on theprogram in
 which they participate. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution fromthe
 main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grownsignificantly
 in recent years and we believe this customer base represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future. To target premium main floorplayers in
 order to grow revenue and improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which includeboth table games and slots, to 
the main floor gaming area. The amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players.  VIP
 gaming at MGM China is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chipsand in turn they sell these 
chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the4

 amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gami
ng promoter commissions are bas ed on a percentage of
 the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of thetable
 games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, foo d  and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. Gaming promotercommissions
 are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as areduction of cas 
ino revenue.  
Our
 key  competitors  in  Macau  include  five  other  gaming  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  grant  additionalconcessions
 or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations orcash
 flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the CotaiStrip.
 
We
 encounter  competition  from  major  gaming  centers  located  in  other  areas  of  Asia  and  around  the  world,  including  Singapore,  Korea,  Australia,  NewZealand, Malaysia, Vietna
m, Cambodia, the Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region. 
Marketing
 
Our
 marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and innewspapers and magazines
 in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We alsoadvertise
 through  our  regional  marketing  offices  located  in  major  U.S.  and  foreign  cities.  Our  direct  marketing  efforts  utilize  advanced  analytic  techniques  thatidentify
 customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, andhelp build lasting custome
r relationships.  
M
 life Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in bothgaming

Employees
and
Management
 
We
 believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees are a primary success factor in the hospitality industry. Therefore, we invest heavily inrecruiting,
 training, motivating and retaining exceptional employees, and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible. We have numerousprograms,
 both at the corporate and business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives. We believe our internal development programs, such as the MGMResorts University and various le
adership and management training programs, are best in class among our industry peers. 
Corporate
Social
Responsibility
 
We
 believe  that  profitability  and  social  responsibility  can  be  linked  for  long-term  sustainability  and  profitability  in  furtherance  of  value  t o  all  ourstakeholders
 –  our  shareholders,  our  employees,  our  customers  and  our  communities.  Whether  we  refer  to  our  philosophy  as  Corporate  Social  Responsibility(“CSR”) or associated Environmen
tal and Social Governance (“ESG”) metrics, we strive to further two fundamental principles ‒ ethical, legal conduct in the way weconduct our business, and integra
tion of social responsibility as a distinct, strategic discipline into the fabric of our culture and sustainable business operations.   
Through
 investment of many years of dedicated effort and resources, our evolving CSR approaches – grounded in prudent fiscal management and long-termfocused strategies – have 
advanced us beyond leadership in the gaming and hospitality industry to national recognition for our accomplishments. 
Our
 core values of integrity, inclusion, teamwork and excellence shape our character and culture, the way we do business, and our CSR practices.  Fourstrategic pillars gu
ide our work. 
Fostering
diversity
and
inclus
ion.
Our commitment  to inclusion translates diversity as a fundamental paradigm of the 21st century global economy into long-term
 human capital leadership, customer market expansion and competitive business advantage.  Inclusion is an important, multi-dimensional business imperativethat
 attracts  top  talent;  drives  our  culture  of  respect  for  humanity;  leverages  the  broad  diversity  of  our  employees’  talents  to  drive  excellence  in  collaboration,innovation and financial p
erformance; fuels expansion of our customer markets and supply chain; and forges stronger ties with our communities around the world. 
Investing

in
community.
  The communities in which we operate, and our employees live, work and care for their families, are cornerstones of our businessand
 our CSR system.  We create economic opportunity for local residents, collaborate to promote educational and develop skills of local workforces, engage localbusinesses,
 and stimulate economic development in our communities.  We promote responsible gaming practices and tools, such as GameSense, that keep gamingsafe
 and entertaining.  Beyond our tax support of public education, infrastructure and services, we make philanthropic and development-related investments in long-term institutions tha
t benefit our employees and customers and elevate the quality of life and culture in our communities. 
Caring

for
one
another.
  We believe caring for less fortunate community neighbors is a deep-rooted part of our culture, and our actions help uplift thecommunities in
 which we operate, while simultaneously instilling employee pride and engagement in our business. Through three primary channels – our employee-driven
 MGM Resorts Foundation, our Employee Volunteer Program and our Corporate Giving Program, we contribute leadership, funding and manpower to anextensive
 array  of  nonprofit  organizations  that  provide  services,  goods  and  resources  indispensable  to  our  communities’  well-being,  development  andstability.
  Significantly,  in  2018,  our  U.S.  employees  invested  more  than  123,000  hours  of  voluntary  service  with  community  non-profits  and  achieved  a  71%participation leve
l in giving through our MGM Resorts Foundation.     
Environmental

sustainability.
We  continue  to  gain  recognition  for  our  comprehensive  environmental  responsibility  initiatives  in  energy  and  waterconservation,
 recycling and waste management, sustainable supply chain and green construction. Certain of our casino resorts in Nevada and our casino resort inMichigan
 were the first in each state to earn certification from Green Key, one of the largest international programs evaluating environmental sustainability in hoteloperations.
 We received certifications at all of our domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, Delano, Mandalay Bay, and MGMGrand
 Detroit  have  all  received  “Five  Green  Key,”  the  highest  possible  rating.  Many  major  travel  service  providers  recognize  the  Green  Key  designation  andidentify our resorts for 
their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.  
In
 addition,  we  believe  that  incorporating  the  tenets  of  environmental  sustainability  in  our  business  decisions  advances  a  platform  for  innovation  andoperational
 efficiency. CityCenter (Aria, Vdara and Veer) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six LEED ® Gold certifications fromthe U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council
”), CityCenter serves as the6

 standard
 for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scale hospitality industry. Also, MGM National Harbor, The Park, and T-MobileArena have all been awarded LEED 
® Gold certification by the Council. 
At
 MGM  China,  we  incorporate  the  same  commitment  to  environmental  preservation.  Our  efforts  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  indoor  air  quality,  andenvironmental
 stewardship  have resulted  in MGM China being included  in the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability  Benchmark  Index on the Hong Kong StockExchange. MGM Cotai has achieved the Chin
a Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and Energy Saving (Macau) Association. 
Development
and
Leveraging
Our
Brand
and
Management
Assets
 
In
 allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending on strategic developments orinitiatives
 and repaying long-term debt or returning capital to shareholders. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at ourcurrent resorts that will 
provide profitable returns. 
We
 regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets. Opportunities we evaluate may include theownership,
 management  and  operation  of  gaming  and  other  entertainment  facilities  in  Nevada,  or  in  states  other  than  Nevada,  or  outside  of  the  United  States,accessing
 new markets for sports and interactive, as well as online gaming. We leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategicpartnerships
 and  international  expansion  opportunities.  We  feel  that  several  of  our  brands  are  well-suited  to  new  projects  in  both  gaming  and  non-gamingdevelopments. We may under
take these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties. 
During
 2018, we entered into an agreement with GVC Holdings PLC to form Roar Digital LLC, a world-class sports betting and online gaming platform inthe United States.
 The 50/50 venture will be capitalized with initial commitments of $100 million per partner. Under the agreement, the venture will benefit from theeconomics
 of our existing race and sports books and online gaming operations and will have exclusive access to certain U.S. land-based and online sports betting,online
 real  money  and  free-to-play  casino  gaming,  major  tournament  and  online  poker,  and  other  similar  future  interactive  businesses.  The  commencement  ofoperations is subject to ga
ming regulatory approvals. 
Intellectual
Property
 
Our
 principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGMResorts International,
 Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus, Beau Rivage and Empire City, all of which have been registered or allowed in variousclasses
 in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities anddevelopment
 projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties andservices.
 We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the namerecognition,
 reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration solong
 as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand developmentand identification, and 
enforcement of our trademark rights. 
Employees
and
Labor
Relations
 
As
 of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 55,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically, of which approximately 6,000 and 3,000,respectively,
 support  the  Company’s  management  agreements  with  CityCenter.  In  addition,  we  had  approximately  11,000  employees  at  MGM  China.  We  hadcollective
 bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 39,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2018. Collective bargaining agreements withthree
 unions covering a substantial number of our employees in Las Vegas are scheduled to expire in the first half of 2019. We anticipate negotiations for successorcontracts
 with all three of those unions will begin in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, in our regional properties, new collective bargaining agreements will benegotiated
 in 2019 at MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield. As of December 31, 2018, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union andthe resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. In January 2019, we acquire
d operations in New York that employ approximately 1,000 employees,a
 portion of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We anticipate several of these agreements will be negotiated in 2019. Also, in July 2018, MGPacquired its
 property in Northfield, Ohio, which continues to be operated (on behalf of MGP) by an affiliate of Hard Rock International (STP), Inc. MGM expects toacquire these operat
ions in the first half of 2019, subject to certain customary closing conditions. The Ohio operation has employees covered by collective bargainingagreements, several o
f which we anticipate will be negotiated in 2019. 
Regulation
and
Licensing
 
The
 gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subjectto extensive regulation und
er the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located.7

 These laws, rules and regulat
ions generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest inthe gaming operations. Viola
tions of laws in one jurisdiction could result in dis ciplinary action in oth er jurisdictions.   
A
 more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, whichExhibit is incorporated he
rein by reference. 
Our businesses are subject to va
rious federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include,but
 are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes(including
 regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations  to meet certain federal requirements related to accessand
 use by persons with disabilities) ,  construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and aresubject
 to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or newlaws
 and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authoritiescould adversely affec
t our operating results. 
In
 addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean WaterAct,
 the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.Under
 various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation ofcertain hazardous or
 toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, thepresence
 of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effecton us or the results of our opera
tions.

RISK
FACTORS  
You should
 be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SECcould
 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, amongother things, the risks descr
ibed below.
Risks
Relating
to
Our
Substantial
Indebtedness

 
• Our
substantial
indebtedness
and
significant
financial
commitments,
including
the
fixed
component
of
our
rent
payments
to
MGP,
could
adversely
affectour
operations

and
financial
results
and
impact
our
ability
to
satisfy
our
obligations
. As  of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $15.3 billion ofprincipal
 amount of indebtedness outstanding, including $750 million of borrowings outstanding and $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity underour
 senior  secured  credit  facility,  and $2.4 billion  and $2.8 billion  of debt outstanding  under the MGM China and the Operating  Partnership  creditfacilities, respectively. In
 addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Operating Partnership had $1.9 billion of senior notes outstanding. Any increase in theinterest
 rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund ourother
 liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM China’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to theextent
 MGM  China  or  the  Operating  Partnership  were  to  cease  to  produce  cash  flow  sufficient  to  service  their  indebtedness,  our  ability  to  makeadditional investments 
into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility. 
In addition, our substantial 
indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including: 
 
• increasing our exposure to gen eral adverse economic and industry conditions; 
• limiting our flexibi lity to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 
• limiting our  ability  to  borrow  additional  funds  for  working  capital  requirements,  capital  expenditures,  debt  service  requirements,execution of our business stra
tegy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements; 
• making it more diffi cult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or 
• placing us at a competitive  disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors. 
Moreover,
 our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodicallyinvest
 significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished (and, under the master lease we are required to spend anaggregate
 amount  of  at  least  1%  of  actual  adjusted  net  revenues  from  the  properties  subject  to  the  master  lease  on  capital  expenditures  at  thoseproperties).
 Such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations,funds
 must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort inJapan, and acquisitio
ns could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrenceof contingent liabili
ties, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 and  investments  depends  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash  flow  in  the  future,  receive  distributions  from  our  unconsolidated  affiliates  orsubsidiaries,
 including  CityCenter,  MGM  China  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  borrow  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  or  incur  newindebtedness.
 If  regional  and  national  economic  conditions  deteriorate  we  could  experience  decreased  revenues  from  our  operations  attributable  todecreases
 in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and otherrestrictive
 covenants in our debt instruments. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or continue toreceive
 distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including CityCenter, MGM China and the Operating Partnership. We cannotassure
 you  that  future  borrowings  will  be  available  to  us  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  enable  us  to  pay  ourindebtedness
 or  to  fund  our  other  liquidity  needs.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  we  will  be  able  to  access  the  capital  markets  in  the  future  to  borrowadditional indebtedness on t
erms that are favorable to us. 
We
 have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2020, and thereafter. Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in thefuture
 will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis,we
 might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is noassurance
 that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or onterms that would not requir
e us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.

as
well
as
significantly
affect
our
liquid
ity, 
and
therefore
could
adversely
affect

. Covenants governing our senior secur
ed credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to: 
 
• pay dividends or distributions, r epurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments; 
• incur additional debt;  
• incur liens on assets;  
• sell assets or consolidat e with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets; 
• enter into transact ions with affiliates; 
• allow certain subsidiaries  to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and 
• enter into sale and le ase-back transactions. 
Our
 ability  to  comply  with  these  provisions  may  be  affected  by  events  beyond  our  control.  The  breach  of  any  such  covenants  or  obligations  nototherwise
 waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which inturn could
 trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, our senior secured credit facility requires usto
 satisfy certain financial covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interestcoverage
 ratio. Any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, ourfinancial condition, our 
results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt. 
In
 addition, MGM Grand Paradise and MGM China are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the Operating Partnership is aborrower
 under  its  senior  secured  credit  facility,  all  of  which  contain  covenants  that  restrict  the  respective  borrower’s  ability  to  engage  in  certaintransactions.
 In particular, these credit agreements require MGM China and the Operating Partnership to satisfy certain financial covenants and imposecertain
 operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries (including, with respect to MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise).These
 restrictions  include,  among  other  things,  limitations  on  their  ability  to  pay  dividends  or  distributions  to  us,  incur  additional  debt,  makeinvestments or engage in oth

• We
are
required
to
pay
a
significant
portion
of
our
cash
flows
as
fixed
and
percentage
rent
under
the
master
lease,
which
could
adversely
affect
ourability

to
fund
our
operations
and
growth,
service
our
indebtedness
and
limit
our
ability
to
react
to
competitive
and
economic
changes
.  For the thirdlease
 year which commenced on April 1, 2018, we were required to make annual rent payments of $770 million under the master lease. The masterlease
 also provides for fixed annual escalators of 2% on the base rent in the second through sixth years and the possibility for additional 2% increasesthereafter
 subject to the tenant meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as well as potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every fiveyears
 thereafter based on a percentage of average actual annual net revenue during the preceding five year period. As a result, our ability to fund ourown
 operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes maybe adversely affect
ed. For example, our obligations under the master lease may: 
 
• make it more diffi cult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;  
• increase our vulnerabi lity to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business; 
• require  us  to  dedicate  a  substantial  portion  of  our  cash  flow  from  operations  to  making  rent  payments,  thereby  reducing  theavailability
 of  our  cash  flow  to  fund  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  development  projects  and  other  general  corporatepurposes;
 
• limit our flexibil ity in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  
• restrict our ability to make ac quisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and 
• cause  us to lose our rights with respect to all of the properties leased under the master lease if we fail to pay rent or other amounts orotherwise default on the master lease, given that all of the properties we lease from MGP under the master lease are effectively cross-
collateralized as a result of the
 master lease being a single unitary lease. 
Any of the above factors could hav
e a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Risks
Related
to
our
Business
 
 
• We
face
significant
competition
with
respect
to
destination
travel
locations
generally
and
with
respect
to
our
peers
in
the
industries
in
which
wecompete,
and

failure
to
compete
effectively
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations
and
cash
flow
. The hotel,
 resort and casino industries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel,resort
 and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel roomcapacity
 is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may alsoexpand their hotel room capacity, expand their
 range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in thedomestic
 regional  markets  in  which  we  operate,  all  of  which  could  attract  our  customers.  Also,  the  growth  of  gaming  in  areas  outside  Las  Vegas,including California, has
 increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. While we believe our principal competitors aremajor
 gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peerinventory
 sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners. We expect that we will continue to faceincreased
 competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travelindustry that could impac
t our ability to attract and retain business. 
In
 addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of  new  gamingestablishments
 located closer to our customers than our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos locatedelsewhere in or
 near Asia, certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) maylegalize
 casino  gaming  (or  online  gaming)  in  the  future  (including,  for  example,  a  recent  proposal  by  China  to  allow  gambling  on  Hainan  Island).Furthermore,
 currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos inMacau.
 If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if currentconcessionaires and subconcess
ionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition.   
Most
 jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses.Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign cou
ntries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases newgaming
 operations  may be  restricted  to  specific  locations  and  we  expect  that  there  will be  intense  competition  for  any attractive  new  opportunities(which
 may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including Nevada and New Jersey, have alsolegalized
 forms  of  online  gaming  and  other  jurisdictions,  including  Illinois,  have  legalized  video  gaming  terminals.  Additionally,  in  May  2018,  theUnited
 States Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting that had prohibited single-game gambling in most states, raising the potentialfor
 increased competition in sports betting should additional states pass legislation to legalize it.  The expansion of online gaming, sports betting, andother
 types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casinoresorts.
 
In
 addition  to  competition  with  other  hotels,  resorts  and  casinos,  we  compete  with  destination  travel  locations  outside  of  the  markets  in  which  weoperate.
 Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flow. 
 
• Our
businesses
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
and
the
cost
of
compliance
or
failure
to
comply
with
such
regulations
may
adversely
affect
ourbusiness

and
results
of
operations
.  Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities  is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states andprovinces
 in which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,financial
 stability  and  character  of  the  owners  and  managers  of  gaming  operations  as  well  as  persons  financially  interested  or  involved  in  gamingoperations.
 As  such,  our  gaming  regulators  can  require  us  to  disassociate  ourselves  from  suppliers  or  business  partners  found  unsuitable  by  theregulators
 or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreignunconsolidated
 affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. Theregulatory
 environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our resultsof
 operations. For  example, recently the U.S. Department of Justice reversed a 2011 opinion that had concluded that the Wire Act of 1961 was limitedto gaming relating to
 sports; the Department of Justice concluded instead that certain of the Wire Act’s provisions apply also to other forms of wageringactivity.
 This may impact our ability to engage in online gaming in the future. In addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject topossible
 increase at any time by various federal, state, local and foreign legislatures and officials. Increases in gaming taxation could also adverselyaffect
 our results. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see “Regulation and Licensing” and Exhibit 99.2 to thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.
13

  
Further,
 our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  and  investors  in  our  properties  must  meet  approval  standards  of  certain  state  and  foreign  regulatoryauthorities.
 If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with thatperson or
 the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into theconduct or
 associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and privateissuances of securities a
nd other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities. 
In
 Macau, current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent onthe
 interpretation of these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in thefuture
 render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, whichcould
 have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, MGM China’s activities in Macau aresubject
 to  administrative  review  and  approval  by  various  government  agencies.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  China  will  be  able  to  obtain  allnecessary
 approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress tothe courts with respect to 
administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues. 
In
 addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general.These
 laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking,employees,
 currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal,state
 and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation RecoveryAct,
 the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state andlocal
 environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certainhazardous
 or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsiblefor, the
 presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws andregulations
 could be enacted. For example, Illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants, work places,schools
 and  casinos.  In  addition,  effective  January  1,  2019,  smoking  in  casinos  in  Macau,  including  MGM  Macau  and  MGM  Cotai,  will  only  bepermitted inside
 specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation inother
 jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financialperformance.
 
We
 also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money
 laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970,commonly
 known as the “Bank Secrecy Act,” which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currencytransactions
 in  excess  of  $10,000  that  occur  within  a  24-hour  gaming  day,  including  identification  of  the  individual(s)  involved  in  the  currencytransaction.
 We  are  also  required  to  report  certain  suspicious  activity  where  we  know,  suspect  or  have  reason  to  suspect  transactions,  among  otherthings,
 involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawfulpurpose. In addition,
 under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention.Our
 compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could beinterpreted
 differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including theBank Secrecy Act, or regulations by 
any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
• Our
business
is
affected
by
economic
and
market
conditions
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
and
in
the
locations
in
which
our
customers
reside
. Our
 business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  andbusiness development. Economic 
contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions maycause
 a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition, changes indiscretionary
 consumer  spending  or  consumer  preferences  could  be  driven  by  factors  such  as  the  increased  cost  of  travel,  an  unstable  job  market,perceived
 or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other acts ofviolence.
 Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted inrecent
 growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers andtimely react to
14

  
these  trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas in particular may beaffected
 by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada  resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United States, and Californiain
 particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely tocause
 a reduction i n  visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results. For example, the prior recession and downturn inconsumer and corporate spend
ing had a negative impact on our results of operations. 
In
 addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai from mainland China, general economic andmarket conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slo
wdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on traveland
 currency  conversion  or  movements,  including  market  impacts  resulting  from  China’s  recent  anti-corruption  campaign  and  related  tightening  ofliquidity
 provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals andother
 ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas  imposed by the government), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland China and/or theamounts
 they are willing to spend in the casino. Most recently, in July 2017, the Chinese government, along with Macau authorities, implemented newfacial
 recognition  technology  on  ATM  machines  in  Macau  to  strictly  enforce  the  “know  you r
 customer”  regulations  for  mainland  Chinese  bankcardholders
 and in November 2017 new rules were adopted to control the cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments. It isunclear whether these
 and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments havehad,
 and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainlandChina, which could adversely impa
ct tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.Furthermore,
 our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources. Our success in Macau will be impacted by ourability
 to retain and hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that suchcompetition
 will grow in light of new developments in Macau. While we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts, certainMacau government policies
 limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hireMacau residents
 as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs toincrease.
 Finally,  because  additional  casino  projects  have  commenced  operations  and  other  projects  are  under  construction,  existing  transportationinfrastructure
 may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate tomeet
 the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the resultsof operations at our develop
ment in Cotai, Macau, could be negatively impacted.

We  have undertaken an initiative to reduce costs, improve efficiencies andfurther
 position us for growth. While we believe these initiatives will result in approximately $200 million of annual Adjusted EBITDA benefit by theend
 of 2020 and an additional $100 million by the end of 2021, our efforts may fail to achieve expected results. Our MGM 2020 Plan is subject tonumerous
 risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual Adjusted EBITDA benefit may differ materially from what weanticipate.

 or discontinue  the payment  of dividends  entirely.  In addition,  our ability  to pay dividends  is restricted  by certain  covenants  in our creditagreement,
 and  because  we  are  a  holding  company  with  no  material  direct  operations,  we  are  dependent  on  receiving  cash  from  our  operatingsubsidiaries
 to  generate  the  funds  from  operations  necessary  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock.  We  expect  our  subsidiaries  will  continue  togenerate significant
 cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock; however, their ability to generate funds will besubject
 to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of fundsavailable

 and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our corporatechain
 must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these variouslimitations

 We  lease eleven of our destination resorts and The Park from a subsidiary of MGP pursuant to the master lease. Themaster lease has a term of ten
15

  
years  with up to four additional five-year extensions, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The master lease is commonly known as a triple-netlease. Accor 
dingly,  in addition to rent, we are required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance requiredin
 connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied o n or  with respect to the leased properties(other
 than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leasedproperties and
 the business conducted on the leased pr operties.  We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of thebenefits received
 in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to MGP as owner of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of our leased facilitiess 
hould prove to be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations, or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particularproperty,
 we would remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease even if  we decided to cease operations at thoselocations
 unless we are able to transfer the rights with respect to a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the master lease. Ourability
 to transfer our obligations under the master lease to a  third-party with respect to individual properties, should we decide to withdraw from aparticular
 location, is limited to non-Las Vegas properties and no more than two Las Vegas gaming properties, and is subject to identifying a willingthird-party
 who m eets  the requirements for a transferee set forth in the master lease. We may be unable to find an appropriate transferee willing   toassume
 the obligations under the master lease with respect to any such property. In addition, we could incur special charges relating  to the closing ofsuch
 facilities including sublease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have amaterial
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of ope rations.  Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costsdescribed
 above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rentin leases that now place t

We  own the singleoutstanding
 Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits orlosses
 or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of thevoting
 power of MGP’s shares so long as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownershipof
 the  combined  economic  interests  in  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership  does  not  fall  below  30%.  We,  therefore,  have  the  ability  to  exercisesignificant control ove

MGP’s
 operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (otherthan

As
 a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit tous
 may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from aconflicts
 committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. Thefailure to obtain such r
equisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.

 has  the  right  to  unilaterally  terminate  the  subconcession  in  the  event  of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  withapplicable
 Macau laws or MGM Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity toremedy
 any  such  non-compliance  with  its  fundamental  obligations  under  the  subconcession  contract  within  a  period  to  be  stipulated  by  the  Macaugovernment.
 Upon  such  termination,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  area  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  would  be  transferredautomatically
 to  the  Macau  government  without  compensation  to  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  and  we  would  cease  to  generate  any  revenues  from  theseoperations.
 We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfiesthe requirements of th

Furthermore, under
 the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau governmentmight
 promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that theselaws
 and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses. If any disagreement arises between MGMGrand
 Paradise  and  the  Macau  government  regarding  the  interpretation  of,  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  compliance  with,  a  provision  of  thesubconcession
 contract,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  relying  on  a  consultation  and  negotiation  process  with  the  Macau  government.  During  anyconsultation or
 negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macaugovernment.
 Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession uponthe
 occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations inMacau, which would have a mater

In
 addition, the subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020. Unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion ofcasino
 premises  is  amended,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  will  automatically  be  transferred  to  theMacau
 government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. Beginning onApril
 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macaugovernment
 exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation orindemnity
 will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the conventionand
 exhibition facilities,  during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation  and amortization,  multiplied by thenumber of
 remaining years before expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to renew or extend thesubconcession
 contract on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, thecompensation paid to MGM Grand Paradis

• MGM
Grand
Paradise
is 
dependent
upon
gaming
promoters
for
a
significant
portion
of
gaming
revenues
in
Macau
.  Gaming promoters, who promotegaming
 and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Maca u. With the
 rise in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operatedby
 licensed gaming promoters, the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased. Wh ile  MGM Grand Paradise is undertakinginitiatives
 to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships withgaming
 promoters. In addition, continued reductions in, and new reg ulations  governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure ofadditional
 VIP  rooms  in  Macau,  including  VIP  rooms  at  MGM  Macau  and  MGM  Cotai.  If  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  unable  to  maintain  or  growrelationships
 with gaming promoters, or if gamin g  promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our high-end customers (or if, as aresult
 of  recent  market  conditions  in  Macau,  gaming  promoters  encounter  difficulties  attracting  patrons  to  come  to  Macau  or  experience  decreasedliquidity 
limiting  their ability to grant credit to patrons), MGM Grand Paradise’s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. Furthermore, ifexisting
 VIP rooms at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai are closed there can be no assurance that MGM Grand Paradise will be ab le  to locate acceptablegaming promoters to run such VIP rooms 
in the future in a timely manner, or at all. 
In
 addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliancewith
 gaming licenses. While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gamingpromoters
 with whom MGM Grand Paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon. If a gaming promoter falls belowMGM
 Grand  Paradise’s  standards,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  or  we  may  suffer  reputational  harm  or  possibly  sanctions  from  gaming  regulators  withauthority over our operat
ions. 
We
 also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact therecoverability of th
ese loans. 
 
• We
are
subject
to
taxation
by
various
governments
and
agencies
and
the
rate
of
taxation
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
could
change
in
thefuture.
We  are subject to tax by various governments and agencies, both in the U.S. and in Macau. Changes in the rates of taxation, the amount of taxeswe owe and the
 time when income is subject to taxation, the Macau income tax exemption or the imposition of foreign withholding taxes could increaseour overall rate of t
axation. Any of these changes could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
• The
future
recognition
of

is
uncertain,
and
the
amount
of
valuation
allowance
we
may
apply
against
suchdeferred

tax
asset
may
change
materially
in
future
periods.
We  currently  have  significant  deferred  tax  assets  resulting  from  foreign  tax  creditcarryforwards
 that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic lossesto
 the extent of U.S. taxable income. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to theextent
 that  we  determine  it  is  not  more  likely  than  not  such  asset  will  be  recovered.  This  evaluation  is  based  on  all  available  evidence,  includingassumptions
 concerning future U.S. operating profits and our interpretations of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) based upon guidanceissued
 to date. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptionscould
 result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including suchchange.
 
 
• Extreme
weather
conditions
or
climate
change
may
cause
property
damage
or
interrupt
business,
which
could
harm
our
business
and
results
ofoperations
.  Certain  of  our  casino  properties  are  located  in  areas  that  may  be  subject  to  extreme  weather  conditions,  including,  but  not  limited  to,hurricanes
 in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties,and
 reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or othercause
 of water shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adverselyaffect
 our business and results  of operations.  Although we maintain  both property and business interruption  insurance  coverage  for certain  extremeweather
 conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for businessinterruption,
 and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extremeweather conditions. Furthermore, such extreme weather
 conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to ouraffected
 properties  to  decrease  for  an  indefinite  period,  which  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  ofoperations and cash flows.
 
 
• Because
a
significant
number
of
our
major
gaming
resorts
are
concentrated
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip,
we
are
subject
to
greater
risks
than
a
gamingcompany

that
is
more
geographically
diversified
.  Given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, ourbusiness may
 be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and theimpact of any events tha
t disrupt air18

  
travel to  and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we relyon air traffic 
for a  significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impactthe
 number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between Las Vega s  and Southern California, where a largenumber of
 our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visitour facilities.
 
 
• We
extend
credit
to
a
large
portion
of
our
customers
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
collect
gaming
receivables
.  We conduct a portion of our gamingactivities
 on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markersthan
 slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is morevolatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gami
ng may have a significant positive or negative impacton
 cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customerscould have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result
s of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose levelof
 play  and  financial  resources  warrant,  in  the  opinion  of  management,  an  extension  of  credit.  In  addition,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  extends  credit  tocertain
 gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers and gamingpromoters could have a signi
ficant impact on our results of operations. 
While gaming debts evidenced
 by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments ongaming
 debts  are  enforceable  in  all  states  under  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  of  the  U.S.  Constitution,  other  jurisdictions  may  determine  thatenforcement
 of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in theU.S.
 of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts ofmany foreign nations.
 
Furthermore,
 we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To theextent
 MGM China gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it willbe able to collect
 all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM Chinamay
 encounter  forums  that  will  refuse  to  enforce  such  debts.  Moreover,  under  applicable  law,  MGM  China  remains  obligated  to  pay  taxes  onuncollectible winnings fro
m customers. 
Even where gaming debts are
 enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact onour operating results.
 
 
• We
may
incur
impairments

assets
which

 Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth haveresulted
 in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges orwrite-downs
 may be required in future periods. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a materialadverse impact on our consol
idated results of operations.

or

.  We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our customers travel by air toour
 Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceivedthreat
 to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, although we havebeen able
 to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting fromwar and some forms of terro
rism continues to be unavailable. 
 
• Co-investing
in
our
properties,
including
our
investment
in
CityCenter,
decreases
our
ability
to
manage
risk
.  In addition to acquiring or developinghotels
 and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest,as
 a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property. Therefore, the operation of such properties is subject toinherent
 risk  due  to  the  shared  nature  of  the  enterprise  and  the  need  to  reach  agreements  on  material  matters.  In  addition,  investments  with  otherinvestors
 may  involve  risks  such  as  the  possibility  that  the  co-investor  might  become  bankrupt  or  not  have  the  financial  resources  to  meet  itsobligations,
 or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take actioncontrary
 to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resortsowned
 by such entities to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors. Alternatively, our co-investors could take act
ions19

  
binding on the property without our cons ent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabil ities.  
For
 instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its businessand
 its ability to meet its obligations. If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support futurefunding
 requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’sindebtedness
 subject CityCenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incuradditional
 indebtedness,  place  liens  upon  assets,  make  distributions  to  us,  make  certain  investments,  consummate  certain  asset  sales,  enter  intotransactions
 with affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose ofall
 or  substantially  all  of  its  assets.  The  CityCenter  credit  facility  also  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that  require  CityCenter  to  maintain  amaximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter’s credit facility) for each quarter. We cannot be sure that CityCenter will be able to meet this
test in the future or that
 the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.

Any of our future construction, dev

• lack of sufficient, or d elays in the availability of, financing; 
• changes to plans and specifi cations; 
• engineering problems, inc luding defective plans and specifications; 
• shortages of, and price inc reases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets; 
• delays in obtaining or inabi lity to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; 
• changes  in  laws  and  regulations,  or  in  the  interpretation  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  applicable  to  gaming,  leisure,residential, real

• weather interferen ces or delays; 
• fires, typhoons and other natur al disasters; 
• geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and 
• other unanticipated circumstance s or cost increases. 
The
 occurrence  of  any  of  these  development  and  construction  risks  could  increase  the  total  costs,  delay  or  prevent  the  construction,  development,expansion
 or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvalsassociated with our developm
ent projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meetthose
 deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, orincur payment penalti
es in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
We also
 make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties,including revenue lost while 
rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service. 
 
• Our

In
addition,
our
insurance
costs
may
increaseand

we
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
similar
insurance
coverage
in
the
future
.  Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operatingproperties, which covers damage caused by a casualty los
s (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism or other acts of violence), each policyhas
 certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost ofrebuilding
 the facilities if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a majorcasualty.
 In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservationsor
 conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise,deterioration or cor
rosion, insect or animal20

  
damage, and pollution, may not b e covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses. 
In
 addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject toclaims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may
not be adequate to cover a
ll losses in any such event. 
We
 renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we mayneed to further reduce ou
r policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

.  Thedevelopment
 of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of oursuccess.
 While  our  business  as  a  whole  is  not  substantially  dependent  on  any  one  trademark  or  combination  of  several  of  our  trademarks  or  otherintellectual
 property,  we  seek  to  establish  and  maintain  our  proprietary  rights  in  our  business  operations  through  the  use  of  trademarks.  We  fileapplications
 for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despiteour
 efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of someforeign
 countries  do  not  protect  proprietary  rights  to  as  great  an  extent  as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.  Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  ourintellectual
 property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of theproprietary
 rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the stepswe
 have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others.The
 unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages orgoodwill, which could adversely af

.  Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks thatare
 inherent  in  conducting  business under non-United  States  laws, regulations  and customs.  In  particular,  the risks associated  with  the operation  ofMGM China or any future operations in whi
ch we may engage in any other foreign territories, include: 
 
• changes in laws and policies th at govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions; 
• changes in non-United States govern ment programs; 
• possible failure  by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Actand similar anti-bribery law
s in other jurisdictions; 
• general economic condi tions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements; 
• difficulty in establ ishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations; 
• different labor regulations;  
• changes in environmental, h ealth and safety laws; 
• outbreaks of diseases or epid emics; 
• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; 
• political instability and actual  or anticipated military and political conflicts; 
• economic instability and i nflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and 
• uncertainties rega rding judicial systems and procedures. 
These risks, individually or in 
the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
We
 are  also  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks,  including  the  effects  of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  If  the  United  States  dollarstrengthens
 in relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in thecurrencies of other such 
countries will decrease. 
 
• Any
violation
of
the
Foreign
Corrupt
Practices
Act
or
any
other
similar
anti-corruption
laws
could
have
a
negative
impact

us
. A significant portion of
 our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border
 business  and  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  we  transact  business.  We  are  subject  to  compliance  with  the  United  States  Foreign  CorruptPractices
 Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  anti-corruption  laws,  which  generally  prohibit  companies  and  their  intermediaries  from  making  improperpayments
 to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to complywith
 these  laws,  we  cannot  be  sure  that  our  internal  policies  and  procedures  will  always  protect  us  from  violations  of  these  laws,  despite  ourcommitment
 to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal andcivil
 sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of theFCPA. The occurrence or allegation
21

  
of t hese types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

• A
significant
portion
of

force
is
covered
by

agreements.
Work
stoppages
and  other labor problems could negativelyaffect
 our business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 39,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargainingagreements.
 In January 2019, we acquired operations in New York that employ approximately 1,000 employees, a portion of which are covered bycollective
 bargaining agreements. We anticipate several of these agreements will be negotiated in 2019. Also, in July 2018, MGP acquired its propertyin
 Northfield, Ohio, which continues to be operated (on behalf of MGP) by an affiliate of Hard Rock International (STP), Inc. MGM expects to acquirethese
 operations in the first half of 2019, subject to certain customary closing conditions.  The Ohio operation has employees covered by collectivebargaining
 agreements, several of which we anticipate will be negotiated in 2019. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest,strikes
 or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations. Further, adversepublicity
 in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wageand/or
 benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Tothe
 extent that our non-union employees join unions, we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems. Furthermore, we mayhave,
 or  acquire  in  the  future,  multi-employer  plans  that  are  classified  as  “endangered,”  “seriously  endangered,”  or  “critical”  status.  For  instance,Borgata’s
 most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the National Retirement Fund (which spun-off into a newly established fund as of January 1,2018),
 which has been listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improvetheir
 funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may takethe form of a surcharge on b
enefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdrawfrom
 these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time(or
 over  a  period  of  time)  that  would  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors  at  the  time  of  (and  after)  withdrawal.  Any  such  additional  costs  may  besignificant.
 
 
• Our
business
is
particularly
sensitive
to
energy
prices
and
a
rise
in
energy
prices
could
harm
our
operating
results
.  We  are  a  large  consumer  ofelectricity
 and  other  energy  and,  therefore,  higher  energy  prices  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  Accordingly,  increases  inenergy
 costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers mayresult in reduced visit
ation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues. 
 
• The
failure

of
data.
We  collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, andothers
 for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacylaws
 and regulations enacted by the various states, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue toevolve and
 on occasion may be inconsistent between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adoptnew
 or additional  laws and regulations  concerning privacy, data retention,  data transfer, and data protection.  For example, the European Union hasadopted
 a data protection regulation  known as the General Data Protection  Regulation, which became fully enforceable  in May 2018, that includesoperational
 and compliance requirements with significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, California has enacted a new privacy law, knownas
 the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which takes effect in 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the UnitedStates.
 
Compliance
 with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products,properties
 and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance
 by  third  parties  engaged  by  us),  including  accidental  loss,  inadvertent  disclosure,  unapproved  dissemination  or  a  breach  of  security  onsystems
 storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use ortransfer
 of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing of customer andemployee
 information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluatedregularly;
 however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including, but not limited to, computer malware,viruses,
 hacking  and  phishing  attacks  by  third  parties.  In  addition,  while  we  maintain  cyber  risk  insurance  to  assist  in  the  cost  of  recovery  from  asignificant cyber even
t, such coverage may not be sufficient .  
22

 We
 also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintai n  information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availabilityof
 our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and theresults
 of  operations.  For  instan ce,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  criminal  cyber  security  attacks  against  companies  where  customer  and  companyinformation
 has been compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party
 service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service providers facerisks
 relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information  security operations. A significant theft,loss or fraudulent use of
 customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation,cause
 a material disruption to our operations, a nd  result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other partieswhose information was subject to su
ch attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
• We
are
subject
to
risks
related
to
corporate
social
responsibility
and
reputation.
Many  factors influence our reputation and the value of our brandsincluding
 the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our businessfaces
 increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands ifwe
 fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change,workplace
 conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement andretention and the willingness of customers and our partner
s to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and cash flows.
 
 
• We
may
seek
to
expand
through
investments
in
other
businesses
and
properties
or
through
alliances
or
acquisitions,
and
we
may
also
seek
to
divestsome

of
our
properties
and
other
assets,
any
of
which
may
be
unsuccessful
.  We  intend  to  consider  strategic  and  complementary  acquisitions  andinvestments
 in  other  businesses,  properties  or  other  assets.  Furthermore,  we  may  pursue  any  of  these  opportunities  in  alliance  with  third  parties,including
 MGP. Acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect ourbusiness, including risks rela
ted to: 
 
• spending cash and incurring debt;  
• assuming contingent liabi lities; 
• unanticipated issues in in tegrating information, communications and other systems; 
• unanticipated incompa tibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods; 
• retaining key employees ; and 
• consolidating corporate a nd administrative infrastructures. 
We
 cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we willactually
 realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate newassets
 and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss or customer or otherbusiness relationships and the d
iversion of management attention. 
In
 addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement ourbusiness,
 are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we mayattempt to sell these
 identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commerciallyreasonable terms or at all.
 
 
• If
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
increase
gaming
taxes
and
fees
, our
results
could
be
adversely
affected
. State and local authorities raise asignificant
 amount  of  revenue  through  taxes  and  fees  on  gaming  activities.  From  time  to  time,  legislators  and  government  officials  have  proposedchanges
 in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budgetdeficits
 may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gamingtaxes or fees, depending on the 
magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materiallyadversely
 affected.  For  instance,  income  generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  currently  has  the  benefit  of  a  corporate  taxexemption in Macau, which exempts us from paying the 12% complementary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino game
s. This exemptionis
 effective through March 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of the current gaming subconcession. Due to the uncertaintyconcerning
 taxation after the subconcession renewal process, we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted beyondMarch 31, 2020.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS  
October
1
litigation.
We and/or certain of  our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017 shooting inLas
 Vegas.  The  matters  involve  in  large  degree  the  same  legal  and  factual  issues,  each  case  being  filed  on  behalf  of  individuals  who  are  seeking  damages  foremotional
 distress, physical injury, medical expenses, economic damages and/or wrongful death based on assertions that we and/or certain of our subsidiaries werenegligent. We also
 received letters from attorneys purporting to represent other persons with claims related to the October 1, 2017 shooting. Lawsuits were first filedin
 October 2017 and include actions filed by multiple individuals in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada and in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County,California. Some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismisse
d, and plaintiffs’ counsel indicate they anticipate re-filing the lawsuits in similar form. In June2018,
 we removed to federal court all actions that remained pending in California and Nevada state courts following the voluntary dismissals. Motions to remandhave
 been filed in several cases, and we anticipate that there may be additional motions to remand filed in the future. We also initiated declaratory relief actions infederal courts
 in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent to sue. Additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future. InFebruary of 2019, we and plaintiffs
’ counsel commenced mediation of these matters.  The above-described litigation currently is stayed pending mediation .  
We are currently unab
le to reliably predict the future developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of pending or future litigationrelated
 to this matter. We will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, new information andfuture
 circumstances. We intend to defend against these lawsuits and ultimately believe we should prevail, but litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable.Although there are signifi
cant procedural, factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect our belief as to the possibility of liability, we currentlybelieve
 that it is reasonably possible that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. The foregoing determination was made in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principle
s, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on the part of us or any of our affiliates. Given thatthese
 cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range ofreasonably
 possible liability. In the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of ourinsurance coverage. The
 insurance carriers have not expressed a reservation of rights or coverage defense that affects our evaluation of potential losses in connectionwith
 these claims. In addition, our general liability insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual “duty to defend”, payment of legal fees and associatedcosts incurred
 to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. Payment of such fees and costs is in addition to (andnot limited by) the limits 
of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available .  
Other.
We  are a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. Management does not believe that theoutcome of such proceedings wil
l have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows .

Dividend
Policy
 
The

 of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors who will evaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factorsit
 deems relevant, and the contractual limitations described below. In addition, as a holding company with no independent operations, our ability to pay dividendswill
 depend  upon  the  receipt  of  cash  from  our  operating  subsidiaries  to  generate  the  funds  from  operations  necessary  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock.Furthermore,
 our  senior  credit  facility  contains  financial  covenants  and  restrictive  covenants  that  could  restrict  our  ability  to  pay  dividends,  subject  to  certainexceptions.
 In addition, the Operating Partnership and MGM China credit facilities each contain limitations on the ability of the applicable subsidiary under eachcredit agreement 
to pay dividends to us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future.

Overview
 
Our
 primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resortamenities.
 We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage.Most of our revenue is cash-based, throug
h customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the abilityof
 our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. We makesignificant
 investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features andamenities.

 results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continueto be focused on improving our fin
ancial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives. 
During
 the year ended December 31, 2018, Las Vegas visitor volume decreased 0.2%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 1% and Las Vegas Strip gamingrevenue
 increased by 2% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Results ofoperations
 for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts during 2018 were negatively impacted by disruption related to the repositioning and rebranding of Park MGM, discussedbelow.
 
Our
 Regional Operations results are driven and affected by the increasingly competitive jurisdictions that they operate in, including the expansion of otherjurisdictions
 that permit gaming. Results of operations at our Regional Operations were negatively affected by the opening of two casino resorts in Atlantic City,New Jersey in June 2018, which impacted Borga
ta’s operating results, and benefitted from the opening of MGM Springfield in August 2018, discussed below. 
Gross
 gaming  revenue  in  the  Macau  market  increased  14%  in  2018  compared  to  2017,  primarily  as  a  result  of  growth  on  the  Cotai  Strip.  Additionally,according
 to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, visitor arrivals increased 10% and overnight visitors increased 7%in 
2018 compared to 2017. As a significant number of MGM Macau’s customers are from mainland China, we believe operating results at MGM Macau are affectedby
 economic conditions in mainland China as well as certain policy initiatives enacted in mainland China and Macau. Despite concerns over the sustainability ofeconomic growth
 in China, we expect the Macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland China market andinfrastructure
 improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau. We believe recent trends reflect stabilization and growth within theMacau
 market as gross gaming revenue has increased consistently over the last several years. Additionally, we have seen growth due to the opening of MGM Cotaiin February 2018.
 
Pursuant
 to a master lease agreement between the tenant and the landlord, the tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New
 York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, and MGM National Harbor from the landlord.See
 Note  1  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  information  regarding  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  which  we  consolidate  in  ourfinancial
 statements, and Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP. All intercompanytransactions, including t
ransactions under the master lease, have been eliminated in consolidation. 
In July 2018,
 MGP completed its acquisition of the membership interests of Northfield, an Ohio limited liability company that owns the real estate assets andoperations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northf
ield Park. Simultaneously with the close of the transaction, MGP entered into a new agreement with an affiliate of HardRock
 Café International  (STP), Inc. to continue to serve as the manager  of the property.  See Note 4 and Note 17 in the accompanying  financial  statements  forinformation regarding 
this acquisition, the Empire City Acquisition, the Northfield OpCo sale, and the Park MGM Lease Transaction. 
In
 January 2019, we announced the implementation of the MGM 2020 plan to further reduce costs, improve efficiencies and position us for growth. Weexpect to deliver annua
lized Adjusted EBITDA benefit of $300 million in aggregate, consisting of $200 million by the end of 2020 and an additional $100 million bythe
 end of 2021. The MGM 2020 plan will be a company-wide, business-optimization initiative aimed to leverage a more centralized organization to maximizeprofitability and, through k
ey investments in technology, lay the groundwork for our digital transformation to drive revenue growth.31

 Key
Performance
IndicatorsKey performance indica
tors related to gaming and hotel revenue are: 
• Gaming  revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.Our normal table
 games hold percentage is in the range of 22% to 26% of table games drop and 18% to 21% of table games drop at our Las Vegas StripResorts
 and Regional Operations, respectively, and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% of slots handle and 9% to 9.5% ofslots handle at our Las Vegas Strip Reso
rts and Regional Operations, respectively; and 
 
• Hotel  revenue  indicators:  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and  revenue  per  available  room(“REVPAR,”
 a  summary  measure  of  hotel  results,  combining  ADR  and  occupancy  rate).  Our  calculation  of  ADR,  which  is  the  average  price  ofoccupied
 rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price.Because
 the  mix  of  rooms  provided  on  a  complimentary  basis,  particularly  to  casino  customers,  includes  a  disproportionate  suite  component,  thecomposite ADR including complimen
tary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. 
Additional key performanc
e indicators at MGM China are: 
 
• Gaming  revenue  indicators:  MGM  China  utilizes  “turnover,”  which  is  the  sum  of  nonnegotiable  chip  wagers  won  by  MGM  China  calculated  asnonnegotiable
 chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIPcasino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operation
s at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.3% of turnover. Win for main floor gamingoperations at MGM China is typica
lly in the range of 16% to 22% of table games drop.

Summary
Operating
Results
 
Consolidated
 net revenues for 2018 increased 9% compared to 2017 due primarily to  the opening of MGM Cotai on February 13, 2018 and the opening ofMGM
 Springfield on August 24, 2018. Consolidated  net revenues for 2017 increased 14% compared to 2016 due primarily to the full year of operations at Borgataand
 MGM National Harbor, an increase in casino revenue and rooms revenue at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and an increase in casino revenue at MGM China, asdiscussed further below.
 
32

 Consolid 
ated operating income  in 2018 decreased 14% compared to 2017. C onsolidated operating income in 2018 benefited from a $45 million gain relatedto
 the sale of Grand Victoria and also included $24 million of business interruption insurance proceeds primarily at  Mandalay Bay. The prior year period included abenefit
 of $36 million related to Borgata’s share of a property tax settlement from Atlantic City and a benefit of $45 million related to the modification of the NVEnergy
 exit  fee,  which  included  the  benef it  recognized  at  our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  as  well  as  our  50%  share  of  the  benefit  recognized  at  CityCenter.Consolidated
 operating income was negatively affected by the ramp up of operations at our recently opened MGM Springfield and MGM Cotai resorts i nclusive of depreciation
 expense associated with the new resorts, disruption related to the rebranding at Park MGM, and an increase in corporate expense discussed below. Inaddition,
 preopening and start-up expenses increased as discussed below in “Operati ng  Results – Details of Certain Charges.” Corporate expense, including share-based
 compensation for corporate employees, increased to $419 million in 2018 from $357 million in 2017, and included $19 million in transaction costs, MGMChina
 corporate  expense of  $19  million,  and  costs  incurred  related  to  the  corporate  brand  campaign  and  the  MGM  2020  and  finance  modernization  initiatives.Depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets at MGM China of $166 million was included in corporate in ou 
r non-GAAP reconciliations included herein for 2018. Income fro
m unconsolidated affiliates was $148 million in 2018 compared to $146 million in 2017. 
Consolidated
 operating income was $1.7 billion in 2017 and included the impact of the items discussed above as well as a full year of operations at Borgataand
 MGM National Harbor. Operating income of $2.1 billion in 2016 included a $430 million gain recognized on the Borgata acquisition and a $401 million gainrelated
 to the sale of Crystals at CityCenter, which was partially offset by charges of $152 million of NV Energy exit expense associated with our strategic decisionto
 exit  the  fully  bundled  sales  system  of  NV  Energy.  Operating  income  in  2017  also  benefitted  from  a  decrease  in  preopening  expense  as  discussed  below  in“Operating
 Results – Details of Certain Charges.” Corporate expense increased to $357 million in 2017 from $313 million in 2016, primarily from a $16 millioncharge
 for the Operating Partnership’s share of real estate transfer taxes recorded in connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, with the remainder ofthe
 increase primarily related to corporate brand campaign expenses, legal expenses, and charitable contributions. Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $146million in 2017 compared to $528 
million in 2016, which included the gain related to the sale of Crystals.

We
 completed  our  acquisition  of  Borgata  on  August  1,  2016  and  therefore  began  to  consolidate  Borgata  beginning  on  that  date.  Prior  thereto  our  50%ownership interest in Borgata was 
accounted for under the equity method. 
In
 2018, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $138 million compared to $133 million in 2017,primarily
 due to a $12 million gain on the sale of Mandarin Oriental that we recognized in 2018 related to the reversal of basis differences in excess of our share ofthe
 loss recorded by CityCenter. At Aria, casino revenues decreased 2% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase in incentives and a decrease in table gameshold.
 CityCenter’s non-casino revenues increased 7% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily related to an increase in food and beverage revenue due in part to anincrease in restaur
ant revenues and an increase in catering and banquets during the year. 
In
 2017, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $133 million compared to $446 million in 2016,primarily
 due to our $401 million share of a gain recognized by CityCenter on the sale of Crystals and the corresponding reversal of certain basis differences in2016.
 At Aria, casino revenues increased 11% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in table games win and slots win. Rooms revenue increased 4% in 2017compared to
 2016 related to an increase in REVPAR and food and beverage revenue increased 6% in 2017 due in part to an increase in catering and banquets duringthe year.

 Gross interest expense in 2018 increased $
41 million compared to 2017 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding relating to our senior notes and ourcredit
 facilities and an increase in the weighted aver age  interest rate of our credit facilities, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs.Gross
 interest expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average debt outstanding related to our senior  notes and adecrease
 in the weighted average interest rate of our senior notes. This was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding under our credit facilitiesand an increase in amor
tization of debt issuance costs. See Note 9 t o the accompanying consolida ted financial statements for additional discussion on long-term debtand see “Liquidity and Capita
l Resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash. 
Capitalized interest
 in 2018 decreased from 2017 due primarily to the substantial completion of MGM Cotai in February 2018, partially offset by an increaserelated
 to the MGM Springfield project, which was substantially completed in August 2018. Capitalized interest in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to theopening of MGM National Harbor in Decemb
er 2016, partially offset by the MGM Cotai and MGM Springfield projects. 
Non-operating

items
from
unconsolidated
affiliates.
Non-operating  expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $18 million in 2017 compared to2016,
 due primarily to the acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, at which time, we began to consolidate Borgata. Prior thereto, our 50% ownership interest inBorgata was accounted for under 
the equity method. 
Other,

net.
Other  expense in 2018 decreased $30 million compared to 2017 due primarily to the loss incurred on early retirement of debt in 2017 of $44million
 related to our early retirement of the 11.375%  senior notes due 2018 and the MGM National Harbor credit facility. Other expense in 2017 decreased $24million
 compared to 2016 primarily due to the loss on the early retirement of debt in 2016 of $65 million related to our 7.625% senior notes due 2017, our 7.5%senior notes
 due 2016, our 10% senior notes due 2016, and our prior senior credit facility, offset by the loss on early retirement of debt incurred in 2017 as describedabove.

 (In thousands)   Income before income taxes
 $634,006   $960,790   $1,257,589  Benefit (provision) for in

ign income taxes paid, net of refunds $(10,100 )  $181,651   $68,236  
 
Our
 effective  tax  rate  for  2018  was  favorably  impacted  by  the  reduction  in  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  rate  from  35%  to  21%,  the  reversal  of  Macaushareholder
 dividend tax that was accrued in 2017 upon receipt of the extension of the annual fee arrangement, partially offset by SAB 118 measurement period taxexpense
 related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  Our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a non-recurring, non-cash income taxbenefit
 of $1.4 billion resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required due to the enactment of the Tax Act, partially offset by theaccrual
 of the Macau shareholder dividend tax. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuationallowance
 on foreign  tax credit  (“FTC”) carryovers  and permanent  exclusion  of a portion  of the gain on the Borgata  transaction,  partially  offset  by income  taxexpense
 attributable to the remeasurement of Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from theMacau complementary 
tax on gaming profits. 
Cash
 taxes paid decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act changes, most notably the increase in the recapture of overall domestic lossesfrom
 50 percent of U.S. taxable income to 100 percent of U.S. taxable income, resulting in increased FTC carryover usage.  Cash taxes paid increased in 2017compared
 to 2016 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased U.S. taxable income and state income taxes attributable toBorgata, which has been consolidat
ed since the August 2016 acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in the company. 
Non-GAAP
Measures
 
“Adjusted
 EBITDA” is earnings  before  interest  and other  non-operating  income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and amortization,  preopening  and start-upexpenses, NV
 Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporateexpense
 and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each property. “Adjusted Property EBITDA margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDA divided bynet
 revenues.  Adjusted  EBITDA  information  is  presented  solely  as  a  supplemental  disclosure  to  reported  GAAP  measures  because  management  believes  thesemeasures are 1) widely used 
measures of operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies.39

  
We
 believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA, and Adjusted Property EBITDA margin may be recurring innature
 and  should  not  be  disregarded  in  evaluation  of  our  earnings  performance,  it  is  useful  to  exclude  such  items  when  analyzing  current  results  and  trendscompared
 to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable betweenthe
 periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example,preopening
 and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend onwhere
 the current  period  lies within the development  cycle,  as well as the size and scope of the project(s).  Property transactions,  net includes normal  recurringdisposals,
 gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or agroup
 of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. Inaddition,
 capital allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. Therefore, we use Adjusted PropertyEBITDA as the primary measure of do
mestic resorts operating performance. 
Adjusted
 EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or netincome,
 as indicators of our performance; or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity; or as any other measure determined inaccordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debtprincipal repayments, whi
ch are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin. Also, other companies in thegaming
 and  hospitality  industries  that  report  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  or  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  margin  information  may  calculateAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin in 
a different manner.

Cash
Flows
 
Operating

activities.
Trends  in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected  bychanges
 in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided byoperating
 activities was $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017. Operating cash flows decreased in the current period primarily due to the change inworking capital
 related to timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at MGM China, as well as a decrease in consolidated operating income, andan
 increase in cash paid for interest. In 2018 we received net cash tax refunds of $10 million compared to cash paid for taxes of $182 million in 2017 primarily as aresult of the Tax Act.
 
Cash
 provided by operating activities in 2017 in comparison to 2016 was positively affected by increase in operating income at our Las Vegas Strip Resortsand
 Regional Operations and changes in working capital primarily related to the timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at MGM China,partially offset by an 
increase in cash paid for taxes to $182 million in 2017 compared to $68 million in 2016.

 Investing

activities.
Our  investing  cash  flows  can  fluctuate  significantly  from  year  to year  depending  on  our  decisions  with  respect  to  strategic  capitalinvestments in new or existing 
resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts.Capital
 expenditures related  to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spacesand hotel rooms.
 
Cash
 used  in  investing  activities  in  2018  increased  in  comparison  to  2017  as  a  result  of  the  $1.0  billion  outflow  by  the  Operating  Partnership  for  theNorthfield
 acquisition, partially offset by a decrease of $377 million in capital expenditures as well as an inflow of $164 million for proceeds received related to thesale
 of  our  investment  in  Grand  Victoria.  The  decrease  in  capital  expenditures  from  2018  to  2017  of  $377  million  primarily  reflects  less  expenditures  for  thedevelopments
 of MGM Cotai and MGM National Harbor, partially offset by increased expenditures for MGM Springfield and the rebranding at Park MGM, asdiscussed in further deta
il below.  Cash
 used in investing activities in 2017 decreased in comparison to 2016 as a result of the $559 million outflow for the Borgata acquisition in 2016 as wellas
 a $398 million decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease of $240 million in the distributions received from CityCenter.  The decrease incapital
 expenditures  from  2016  to  2017  of  $398  million  primarily  reflects  less  expenditures  for  the  developments  of  MGM  Cotai  and  MGM  National  Harbor,partially offset by in
creased expenditures for MGM Springfield and the rebranding of Park MGM, as discussed in further detail below. 
Capital
Expenditures
 
In
 2018, we had capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, of which $376 million related to MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest ondevelopment fees
 eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $340 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $36 millionrelated
 to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $1.1 billion included $368million
 related to the construction of MGM Springfield, $228 million related to the Park MGM rebranding project, as well as expenditures relating to the expansionof the convention center 
at MGM Grand Las Vegas and various room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels. 
In
 2017, we had capital expenditures of $1.9 billion, which included $908 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest ondevelopment fees
 eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $856 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $53 millionrelated
 to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $956 million included$269
 million  related  to  the  construction  of  MGM  Springfield,  $221  million  related  to  the  rebranding  at  Park  MGM,  and  $195  million  primarily  related  to  thefinalization
 of construction of MGM National Harbor, as well as various resorts’ room remodels, construction of additional convention space at MGM Grand LasVegas, the parking garage at Ex
calibur, a waterpark at Circus Circus, and various restaurant and entertainment venue remodels. 
In
 2016, we had capital expenditures of $2.3 billion, which included $971 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest ondevelopment fees
 eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $948  million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $23 millionrelated
 to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital  expenditures at our Las  Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of  $1.3 billion included$741
 million  related  to  the  construction  of  MGM  National  Harbor,  $121  million  related  to  the  construction  of  MGM  Springfield,  $39  million  related  to  theconstruction
 of The Park, as well as various room remodels including the tower rooms at Mandalay Bay, construction of additional exhibit space at the MandalayBay
 Convention  Center,  construction  of  the  Park  Theater  and  rebranding  at  Park  MGM,  construction  of  the  parking  garage  at  Excalibur  and  restaurant  andentertainment venue remodels 
.  
Financing

activities.
Cash  provided by financing activities increased in 2018 from the cash used in financing activities in 2017 primarily as a result of netborrowings
 of debt in 2018 of $2.2 billion in comparison to net repayments of debt in 2017 of $138 million, partially offset by MGP’s issuance of class A shares in2017, and an increase in shares 
repurchased in 2018 compared to 2017. 
Cash
 used in financing activities decreased in 2017 from the cash provided by financing activities in 2016 primarily as a result of the net proceeds of $1.1billion from
 MGP’s issuance of class A shares in 2016 compared to the net proceeds of  $388 million from MGP’s issuance of class A shares in 2017, dividends thatwe
 began paying in 2017, as well as an increase of $67 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest owners, partially offset by net payments of debt in 2017 of$138
 million compared to net repayments of debt of $301 million in 2016 as well as the $100 million paid in 2016 as part of consideration for the purchase ofadditional shares of MGM China.

 Borrowings
(repayments)
of
debt
   
In
 2018, we borrowed net debt of $2.2 billion which primarily consisted of the issuance of $1.0 billion 5.750% senior notes due 2025, $368 million of netborrowings
 on our senior credit facility, $137 million of net borrowings on the MGM China credit facility, and $728 million of net borrowings on the OperatingPartnership
 senior credit facility. Additionally, we paid $77 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendments of the Operating Partnership’s senior creditfacility in March and Jun
e 2018, the amendment of MGM China’s credit facility in June 2018, the amendment of our senior credit facility in December 2018, and theissuance of the $1.0 billion 5.750% s

 credit facility, and a $28 million draw on the MGM National Harbor credit facility, as well as the Operating Partnership’s issuance of $350 million 4.50%senior
 notes due 2028 in connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, partially offset by the redemption of our $475 million 11.375% senior notes at apremium, the repaymen
t of $478 million MGM National Harbor credit facility, as well as amortization payments of $132 million on our term loan facilities. 
In

Other
Factors
Affecting
Liquidity
 
Anticipated
uses
of
cash.
 We  require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilizecorporate cash
 management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resortsdaily
 into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. In addition, fromtime
 to  time  we  may  use  excess  funds  to  repurchase  our  outstanding  debt  and  equity  securities  subject  to  limitations  in  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  andDelaware
 law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures andacquisitions.
 
We
 held cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, of which MGM China held $510 million and the Operating Partnership held $60million.
 At December 31, 2018, we had $15.3 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $750 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.3 billionsenior
 secured credit facility, $2.8 billion outstanding under the $3.6 billion Operating Partnership credit facility, and $2.4 billion outstanding under the $2.8 billionMGM
 China credit facility. We expect to make domestic capital investments at our resorts and corporate entities of $600 million to $650 million, which excludes$45
 million to $50 million of construction closeout costs at MGM Springfield. Additionally, we expect to make capital investments at MGM China of $350 millionto $375 million, which includes $250 m
illion of construction closeout costs at MGM Cotai and $100 million to $125 million of maintenance capital expenditures. 
We also
 closed the acquisition of Empire City in January 2019 for a purchase price of approximately $864 million. We funded the acquisition of Empire Citywith
 the issuance of approximately $266 million of our common stock, the assumption of approximately $246 million of debt, which was immediately assumed andrepaid
 by the Operating Partnership, and the remaining balance in cash. Additionally, in January 2019, the Operating Partnership issued $750 million in aggregateprincipal
 amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2027 and, in February 2019, we repaid our $850 million 8.625% notes due 2019. We expect to meet our remaining debtmaturities
 and planned capital expenditure requirements with future anticipated operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under ourcredit facilities.

See Note 9 to the accompanying conso

Off
Balance
Sheet
Arrangements
 
Our
 off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consists primarily of our investment in CityCenter.We
 have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions, other than the Operating Partnership’scash flow
 hedges. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us torealize
 the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment facilities in a manner that minimizes our initial investment. In addition, thereare
 no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had fullownership of the resort.

Critical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates
 
Management’s
 discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Toprepare
 our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimatesand
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly inareas
 we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations,financial
 position or cash flows. Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about ourcritical accounting estimates, and have
 reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree ofuncertainty and therefore actual
 results can differ from our estimates.

Marker play represents 
a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play tothe
 same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers and gamingpromoters.
 We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balancestimely.
 These  collection  efforts  are  similar  to  those  used  by  most  large  corporations  when  dealing  with  overdue  customer  accounts,  including  the  mailing  ofstatements
 and  delinquency  notices,  personal  contacts,  the  use  of  outside  collection  agencies  and  civil  litigation.  Markers  are  generally  legally  enforceableinstruments
 in  the  United  States  and  Macau.  Markers  are  not  legally  enforceable  instruments  in  some  foreign  countries,  but  the  United  States  assets  of  foreigncustomers
 may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, whenwe
 issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the creditworthiness
 of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Company’s casino receivables and thosedue from customers resid
ing in foreign countries. 
We
 maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operatingexpense,
 increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play isnot
 significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play issignificant,
 we  apply  standard  reserve  percentages  to  aged  account  balances  under  a  specified  dollar  amount  and  specifically  analyze  the  collectability  of  eachaccount
 with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other knowninformation. MGM
 China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financialcondition and the collec
tion history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.47

  
In addition to
 enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors,including
 changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balances can besignificant,
 the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in aregion’s economy occur.
 
The following table shows key statis
tics related to our casino receivables, net of discounts:

Approximately
 $48 million and $31 million of casino receivables and $12 million and $7 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivablerelate
 to MGM China at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased inthe
 current year due to a decrease in specific reserve at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts as a result of favorable collections. At December 31, 2018, a 100 basis-pointchange in the allowance fo
r doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $4 million.

Property
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  A  significant  amount  of  our  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  through  business  combinations  and  wastherefore
 recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong itslife
 are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When weconstruct
 assets,  we  capitalize  direct  costs  of  the  project,  including  fees  paid  to  architects  and  contractors,  property  taxes,  and  certain  costs  of  our  design  andconstruction
 subsidiaries.  In  addition,  interest  cost  associated  with  major  development  and  construction  projects  is  capitalized  as  part  of  the  cost  of  the  project.Interest
 is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest startswhen construction activit
ies begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
We
 must  make  estimates  and  assumptions  when  accounting  for  capital  expenditures.  Whether  an  expenditure  is  considered  a  maintenance  expense  or  acapital
 asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,which
 also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated usefullives. We
 determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Wheneverevents or circumstanc
es occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively. 
Impairment
of
Long-lived
Assets,
Goodwill
and
Inde
finite-lived
Intangible
Assets 
We
 evaluate  our  property  and  equipment  and  other  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  based  on  our  classification  as  held  for  sale  or  to  be  held  and  used.Several criteria
 must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the assetat
 a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carryingvalue or fair market value less
 costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be heldand
 used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscountedbasis,
 to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do notexceed
 the  carrying  value,  then  an  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset.  For  operating  assets,  fair  value  is  typically  measured  using  adiscounted
 cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricingmodel,
 based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognizedimpairment losses, whethe
r for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. 
48

 There
 are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of theasset.
 To the extent management decides that  an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest levelfor
 which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the g rouping  of assets. Future cashflow estimates are, by t
heir nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 
On
 a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment.Potential
 factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economicfactors,
 significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgetsand
 probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potentialsale. Historically, undiscoun
ted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. 
We
 review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment testfor
 indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. Forour
 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles andconcluded
 it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  values  of  such  intangibles  exceeded  their  carrying  values  by  a  substantial  margin.  We  elected  to  perform  aquantitative analysis
 for the Borgata trade name using the relief-from -royalty method, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14% in2018 and 4% in 2017. For our 2016 annual impairment
 tests we utilized a quantitative analysis for all of our intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow approachfor
 license rights and using the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. The estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carryingvalues,
 with the fair value of the Borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2%, reflecting the recentness of the Borgata acquisition whichoccurred in August 2016. As discu
ssed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results donot
 meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairmentcharge.
 
We
 review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairmentcharges
 in 2018, 2017 or 2016. For our 2018, 2017, and 2016 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of ourreporting
 units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. Forreporting
 units for which we elected to perform a quantitative analysis, the fair value of such reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin.As
 discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meetcurrent
 expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairmentcharge.
 
There
 are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective andactual
 results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairmenttests are highly judgment
al and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions. 
See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompany
ing consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

See
 Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investments inunconsolidated affili
ates.  None of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had other-than-temporary impairment in 2018, 2017, or 2016. 
Income
Taxes
 
We
 recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences witha future tax benefit 
to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. 
49

 We
 file income tax returns in the U.S. feder al  jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid inforeign
 jurisdictions are not material. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positions taken
 in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 10 in theaccompanying consolidated 
financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact o f examinations by tax authorities. 
We assess our tax positions using a 
two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at the largestamount of
 benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilities we recordas
 a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in “Other accrued liabilities” orlong-term
 in “Other long-term liabilities” based on the time until expected payment. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related tounrecognized tax benefi
ts in income tax expense. 
Refer to Note 10 in the accomp
anying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes.50

ABOUT
MARKET
RISK 
Market
Risk
 
In
 addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arisingfrom
 adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate riskassociated
 with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowingsand
 short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the OperatingPartnership’s
 term  loan  B  facility.  A  change  in  interest  rates  generally  does  not  have  an  impact  upon  our  future  earnings  and  cash  flow  for  fixed-rate  debtinstruments.
 As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected bychanges in
 interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instrumentsfor trading purposes and do not ent
er into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.As
 of December 31, 2018, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 31% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million and $700million
 notional amount Operating Partnership interest rate swaps with weighted average fixed rates that we pay 1.764% and 1.901%, respectively. In December2018,
 the Operating Partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements, for which the Operating Partnership will pay a weighted average 2.735% on atotal
 notional  amount  of  $400  million.  These  swaps  will  be  effective  December  31,  2019,  at  which  point  the  Operating  Partnership  will  be  paying  a  combinedweighted
 average 2.066%. The following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding theeffect of the Operat
ing Partnership interest rate swaps discussed above:

In
 addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates,mainly
 related  to  MGM  China  and  to  our  operations  at  MGM  Macau  and  MGM  Cotai.  While  recent  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  have  not  been  significant,potential
 changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in theseexchange
 rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar willremain at the same 
level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. As of December 31,2018,
 a 1% increase in the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cashbalance by $5 million and a 1
% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $25 million.51

We
 have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018,based
 on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  TreadwayCommission
 (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018,based on criteria est
ablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
We
 have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidatedfinancial
 statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2019,expressed an unqualified opin
ion on those financial statements. 
Basis
for
Opinion

 
The
 Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal
 control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Ourresponsibility is to express an opinion on the
 Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered withthe
 PCAOB  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  andregulations of the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding ofinternal
 control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internalcontrol
 based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides areasonable basis for our opin
ion. 
Definition
and
Limitations
of
Internal
Control
over
Financia
l
Reporting 
A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand
 the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.

NOTE

—
BASIS
OF

PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIESPrinciples

of
consolidation.
For  entities  not  determined  to  be  a  variable  interest  entity  (“VIE”),  the  Company  consolidates  such  entities  in  which  theCompany
 owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity if it has thedirect
 or indirect ability to control the entities’ activities based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements. For these entities, the Companyrecords
 a  noncontrolling  interest  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  Company’s  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  which  are  50%  or  less  owned  areaccounted
 for  under  the  equity  method  when  the  Company  can  exercise  significant  influence  over  or  has  joint  control  of  the  unconsolidated  affiliate.  Allintercompany balances 
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The Company
 evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. AVIE
 is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity thatmost
 significantly impact such entity’s economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additionalsubordinated financial support. The 
Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the powerto
 direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of theVIE
 that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. Forthese
 VIEs, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE uponsubsequent
 events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and thedisposition of all or a port
ion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.Management
 has determined that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct theactivities
 of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGPand
 consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) theexchangeable
 nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company the right to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant toMGP.
 The  Company  has  recorded  MGP’s  ownership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership  of  26.7%  as  of  December  31,  2018  as  noncontrolling  interest  in  theCompany’s
 consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis MGP had total assets of $11.0 billion, primarily related to its realestate investments, and 
total liabilities of $5.1 billion, primarily related to its indebtedness.  61

 Management’s

use
of
estimates.
The  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted inthe
 United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make est imates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assetsand
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during thereporting period. Act 
ual results could diffe r from those estimates. 
Fair

value
measurements.
Fair  value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments inunconsolidated
 affiliates, cost method investments, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair valuemeasurements
 also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sellan
 asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy thatincludes:
 Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which areunobservable inputs. 
The Company used the following inputs in i ts fair value measurements: 
 
• Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9; 
• Level  2  and  Level  3  inputs  when  assessing  the  fair  value  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  during  the  Northfield  transaction  and  Borgatatransaction. See Note 4.
 
Cash
and

cash
equivalents.
Cash  and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date ofacquisition.
 Such  investments  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  market  value.  Book  overdraft  balances  resulting  from  the  Company’s  cash  managementprogram are recorded as acco
unts payable or construction payable as applicable. 
Accounts

receivable
and
credit
risk.
Financial  instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casinoaccounts
 receivable.  The  Company  issues  credit  to  approved  casino  customers  and  gaming  promoters  following  background  checks  and  investigations  ofcreditworthiness. At Decembe
r 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 62% and 40%, respectively, of our gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers fromforeign countries, prim
arily Asia. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables. 
Accounts
 receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to beuncollectible.
 Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce theCompany’s
 receivables  to  their  net  carrying  amount,  which  approximates  fair  value.  The  allowance  is  estimated  based  on  both  a  specific  review  of  customeraccounts
 as  well  as  historical  collection  experience  and  current  economic  and  business  conditions.  Management  believes  that  as  of  December  31,  2018,  nosignificant concentr
ations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded. 
Inventories.
Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  netrealizable value. Cost
 is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determinedusing the cost method.
 
Property

and
equipment.
Property  and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired throughbusiness
 combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in thedetermination
 of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had accrued $47 million and $28million, respectively for
 property and equipment within accounts payable, and $2 million and $34 million, respectively, related to construction retention within otherlong-term liabilities.
 
Property and equipment are g
enerally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
 15 to 40 years Land improvements
 10 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures
 3 to 20 years Equipment
 3 to 15 years  
The
 Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held andused. Several criteria must be met
 before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell theasset
 at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower ofcarrying value
 or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to beheld and
62

 used, the Company reviews for impa
irment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estima ted future cash flows of the asset, on anundiscounted basis,
 to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cashflows do
 not exceed the carr ying  value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flowmodel.
 If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized im pairment  losses, whether for assets held forsale or assets to be held and us
ed, are recorded as operating expenses. 
Capitalized

interest.
The  interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project.When
 no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company’soutstanding
 borrowings.  Capitalization  of  interest  ceases  when  the  project  is  substantially  complete  or  development  activity  is  suspended  for  more  than  a  briefperiod.
 
Investments

in
and
advances
to
unconsolidated
affiliates.
The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equitymethod. Under
 the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences,as well
 as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investmentand
 recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well asgains
 and impairments related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss and classifies non-operating income orlosses
 related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of non-operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in such unconsolidatedaffiliates are 
an extension of the Company’s core business operations. 
The
 Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingvalue of its investment 
may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value ofthe
 investment  to  its  carrying  value  to  determine  if  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determines  whether  the  impairment  is  “other-than-temporary”  based  on  itsassessment
 of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using adiscounted cash flow analysis based on estimated
 future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach thatutilizes
 business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. See Note 6 for results of the Company’s review of itsinvestment in certain of its
 unconsolidated affiliates. 
Goodwill

and
other
intangible
assets.
Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  businesscombinations.
 Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certaincircumstances. The
 Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments were indicated  or recorded as a result ofthe annual impairmen
t review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018, 2017 and 2016.  
Accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of good
will and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referred toas
 “step zero”) in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. In performing the step zero analysis the Company considers macroeconomicconditions,
 industry  and  market  considerations,  current  and  forecasted  financial  performance,  entity-specific  events,  and changes  in the  composition  or  carryingamount
 of  net  assets  of  reporting  units  for  goodwill.  In  addition,  the  Company  takes  into  consideration  the  amount  of  excess  of  fair  value  over  carrying  valuedetermined
 in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zeroanalysis indicates tha
t it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a quantitative analysis. 
Under
 the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimatedfuture
 results of the Company’s reporting  units discounted using market  discount rates and market indicators  of terminal  year capitalization  rates, and a marketapproach
 that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. Effective January 1, 2017, the Companyadopted
 accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly“Step
 2”) in the event that impairment is identified. Instead, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reportingunit’s
 fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights are tested for impairmentusing
 a  discounted  cash  flow  approach,  and  trademarks  are  tested  for  impairment  using  the  relief-from-royalty  method.  If  the  fair  value  of  an  indefinite-livedintangible asset is less 
than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. 
Revenue

recognition.
The  Company’s revenue from contracts with customers consists of casino wagers transactions, hotel room sales, food and beveragetransactions, entert
ainment shows, and retail transactions. 
63

 The
 transaction  price  for  a  casino  wager  is  the  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses  (“net  win”).  In  certain  circumstance s,  the  Company  offersdiscounts
 on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. Commissions rebated to gamingpromoters
 and VIP players at MGM China are also recorded as a reduction of casino  revenue. The Company accounts for casino revenue on a portfolio basis giventhe similar chara
cteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis. 
For
 casino  wager  transactions  that  include  other  goods  and  services  provided  by  the  Company  to  gaming  patrons  on  a  discretionary  basis  to  incentivizegaming,
 the  Company  allocates  revenue  from  the  casino  wager  transaction  to  the  good  or  service  delivered  based  upon  stand-alone  selling  price  (“SSP”).Discretionary goods and servic
es provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense. 
For
 casino wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty programs, the Company allocates a portion of netwin based
 upon the SSP of such incentive (less estimated breakage). This allocation is deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer redeems the incentive.When
 redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third party outlets are deductedfrom
 the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. Commissions and incentives providedto
 gaming  customers  were  collectively  $2.3  billion,  $2.1  billion  and  $1.8  billion  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016,  respectively. After allocating revenue to o
ther goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue. 
The
 transaction  price  of  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  retail  contracts  is  the  net  amount  collected  from  the  customer  for  such  goods  and  services.  Thetransaction
 price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery ismade for the food & beverage and retail & other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue
s. For some arrangements, the Company acts as anagent
 in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services, which primarily include certain of the Company’s entertainment shows as well as customerrooms arranged by online tr
avel agents. 
The
 Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings withhotel
 stays  and  convention  services.  For  such  arrangements,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  to  each  good  or  service  based  on  its  relative  SSP.  The  Companyprimarily
 determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when soldseparately in similar circumstances
 to similar customers. 
Contract
and

Contract-Related
Liabilities.
There  may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue,resulting
 in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chipliability,
 which  represents  the  amounts  owed  in  exchange  for  gaming  chips  held  by  a  customer,  (2)  loyalty  program  obligations,  which  represents  the  deferredallocation
 of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited bycustomers
 before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided such as advance ticket  sales anddeposits
 on  rooms  and  convention  space  or  for  unpaid  wagers.  These  liabilities  are  generally  expected  to  be  recognized  as  revenue  within  one  year  of  beingpurchased, earned, or deposit
ed and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. 
The following table

Reimbursed

costs.
 Costs  reimbursed pursuant to management services are recognized as revenue in the period it incurs the costs as this reflects when theCompany
 performs  its  related  performance  obligation  and  is  entitled  to  reimbursement.  Reimbursed  costs  relate  primarily  to  the  Company’s  management  ofCityCenter.
 
Revenue

by
source.
The  Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage,and entertainment, r
etail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 16. Lease64

 revenues
 earned by the Company from third-parties are classified within the line item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. Leaserevenues
 include $51 million, $51 million and $50 million recorded wit hin  food and beverage revenue for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $87 million, $79million and $77 million r
ecorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. 
Advertising.
The  Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense, which is generally included in generaland administrative exp
enses, was $305 million, $223 million and $171 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Corporate

expense.
Corporate  expense represents unallocated payroll, aircraft costs, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to theCompany’s
 casino  resort  operations.  In  addition,  corporate  expense  includes  the  costs  associated  with  the  Company’s  evaluation  and  pursuit  of  new  businessopportunities, which are expens
ed as incurred. 
Preopening

and
start-up
expenses.
Preopening  and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopeningand start-up expenses includ
e payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations. 
Property
transactions,
net.
The Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolitio n costs, and normal gains and losses on thesale of assets as “Property 
transactions, net.” See Note 15 for a detailed discussion of these amounts. 
Redeemable

noncontrolling
interest.
Certain  noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which providefor
 annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual net gaming revenue (as definedin the MGM National Harbor operat
ing agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90-days after the end of each fiscal year. 
Beginning
 on December 31, 2019 the noncontrolling interest parties will each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portionof
 their interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula. Additionally, certain noncontrolling interest parties each have the right to sellback
 all or a portion of their interests prior to such date if MGM National Harbor were to guarantee or grant liens to secure any indebtedness of the Company or itsaffiliates other 
than the indebtedness of MGM National Harbor. 
The Company
 has recorded the interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheetsand
 not  stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control.  The  interests  were  initially  accounted  for  at  fair  value.Subsequently,
 the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests toequal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount d
oes not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company recordsany
 changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is adjustedfor accrued annual pre
ferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Recently

issued
accounting
standards.
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842 “Leases (Topic 842)”, which replaces the existing guidance in Topic840,
 “Leases”, (“ASC 842”). ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASC 842 requires adual
 approach  for  lessee  accounting  under  which  a  lessee  would  classify  and  account  for  its  lease  agreements  as  either  finance  or  operating.  Both  finance  andoperating
 leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee will recognizeinterest
 expense  associated  with  the  lease  liability  and  depreciation  expense  associated  with  the  ROU  asset;  and  for  operating  leases,  the  lessee  will  recognizestraight-line
 rent  expense.  The  Company  will  adopt  ASC  842  on  January  1,  2019  utilizing  the  simplified  transition  method  and  accordingly  will  not  recastcomparative
 period financial information. The Company will elect the basket of transition practical expedients which includes not needing to reassess: (1) whetherany
 expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) direct costs for any existing leases. TheCompany
 also currently expects that the most significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases that exist at theCompany on the date of adoption with th
e most material of such leases being ground leases.

ACQUISITION
 
Northfield
 
On
 July  6,  2018,  MGP  completed  its  acquisition  of  100%  of  the  membership  interests  of  Northfield  for  a  purchase  price  of  approximately  $1.1  billion(“Northfield
 Acquisition”). MGP funded the acquisition through a $200 million draw on the Operating Partnership’s term loan A and a $655 million draw under theOperating Partnership’s revolvin
g credit facility, with the remainder of the purchase price paid with cash on hand. The acquisition expanded MGP’s real estate assetsand diversified MGP’s geographic 
reach. 
MGP
 recognized 100% of the assets and liabilities of Northfield at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value wasallocated
 to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using both level 2 inputs, which are observable inputsfor
 similar assets, and level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The allocation of fair value for substantially all of the assets and liabilities is preliminary andmay be adjusted up to one
 year after the acquisition. Specifically, as of December 31, 2018, the Company is finalizing valuation work related to the asset classes thatcomprise the property and 
equipment acquired. 
The following table sets for
th the preliminary purchase price allocation as of July 6, 2018 (in thousands): 
Fair value of assets acqui
red and liabilities assumed:   Property and equipment
$ 792,807  Cash and cash equivalents

 25,000  Goodwill
 17,915  Other assets
 9,598  Other liabilities
 (38,786 )  
$ 1,070,365  
 
MGP
 recognized  the  identifiable  intangible  assets  at  fair  value.  The  estimated  fair  values  of  the  intangible  assets  were  preliminarily  determined  usingmethodologies
 under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies expected toarise after the acquisition.
 
As
 further discussed in Note 17, the Company entered into an agreement with MGP to acquire all of the operating assets of Northfield (“Northfield OpCo”)from MGP and the
 real estate assets of Northfield will be leased to a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subjectto
 customary closing conditions. The transaction will be an intercompany transaction and, accordingly, the effect will be eliminated in the Company’s consolidatedfinancial statements.
 
Consolidated

results.
For  the period from July 6, 2018 through December 31, 2018, Northfield’s net revenue was $133 million, operating income and netincome
 were both $33 million. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented because it is not material to the consolidated results ofoperations.

 Empire
City
 
On January
 29, 2019, the Company acquired the real property and operations associated with the Empire City Casino's race track and casino (“Empire City”)for
 total  consideration  of  approximately  $864  million,  plus  customary  working  capital  and  other  adjustments  (“Empire  City  Acquisition”).  The  fair  value  ofconsideration
 paid included the assumption of debt of approximately $246 million, which was subsequently repaid, the issuance of approximately $266 million ofthe Company’s common
 stock, and the remaining balance in cash. If Empire City is awarded a license for live table games on or prior to December 31, 2022 and theCompany accepts
 such license by December 31, 2024, the Company will pay additional consideration of $50 million. Preliminary fair values for assets acquired andliabilities assumed 
are not reported herein as the Company is still in the process of completing the initial accounting for the acquisition. 
Following
 the completion of the acquisition of Empire City, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company andleases the real prope
rty to a subsidiary of the Company. See Note 17 for additional information. 
Borgata
acquisition
 
On
 August  1,  2016,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata  for  cashconsideration of $604 million. Followi
ng the completion of the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from the Company andleases
 the real property to a subsidiary of the Company. Additionally, as discussed in Note 11, Borgata subsequently entered into a property tax reimbursementagreement
 in February 2017 with the Department of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey and Atlantic City and received the settlement amount of $72million in June 2017, half of which 
the Company paid Boyd Gaming, net of fees and expenses.   
Through
 the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in Borgata, the Company obtained 100% of the equity interests in Borgata and therefore consolidatedBorgata
 as  of  August  1,  2016.  The  Company  recognized  100%  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  Borgata  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  the  acquisition.  Prior  to  theacquisition,
 the Company held a 50% ownership interest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. The fair value of the equity interests ofBorgata
 was  determined  by  the  transaction  price  and  equaled  approximately  $1.2  billion.  The  carrying  value  of  the  Company’s  equity  method  investment  wassignificantly less than 
its share of the fair value of Borgata at the acquisition date, resulting in a $430 million gain on the acquisition. 
Borgata’s
 net revenue for the period from August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $350 million, operating income was $34 million and net incomewas $4 million.

 drawn on the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2018, the interest rates on the term loan A facility and the term loan B facility were both 4.52%,and the interest rat
e on the revolving credit facility was 4.43%. 
The
 Operating  Partnership  credit  facility  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default  and  positive  and  negative  covenants.  Therevolving
 credit facility and term loan A facility also require the Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjustedtotal assets ratio,
 maximum total net debt to adjusted assets ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its creditfacility covenants a
t December 31, 2018.  
The
 Operating Partnership senior credit facility is guaranteed by each of the Operating Partnership’s existing and subsequently acquired direct and indirectwholly
 owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries, and secured by a first priority lien security interest on substantially all of the Operating Partnership’s andsuch restricted subsidia
ries’ material assets, including mortgages on its real estate, excluding the real estate assets of MGM National Harbor and Empire City, subjectto customary exclusions.
 
The
 Operating Partnership is party to interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B facility. As of December31,
 2018, the Operating Partnership pays a weighted average fixed rate of 1.844% on total notional amount of $1.2 billion and the variable rate received resetsmonthly
 to the one-month LIBOR with no minimum  floor. In December  2018, the Operating Partnership  entered  into additional  interest  rate swaps that have anotional
 amount of $400 million on which it will pay a fixed rate of 2.735% with the variable rate received resetting monthly to the one-month LIBOR with a floorof
 0%. Such interest rate swaps will become effective on December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the derivative financial instruments have beendesignated as cash flow hedges and qu
alify for hedge accounting. 
MGM
China
credit
facility.
At December 31, 2018, the MGM China credit facility consisted of $1.8 billio n of term loans and a $1.0 billion revolving creditfacility,
 which bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum based on HIBOR plus 1.375% to 2.50%, as determined by MGM China’s leverage ratio. In  June 2018,MGM
 China amended and restated its credit facility for a reduction in the total revolving credit commitments of $450 million to $1.0 billion and an increase in thetotal term
 loan commitments of $450 million to $2.0 billion (the aggregate amount of commitments remained unchanged). The final maturity date was also extendedto
 June 2022, but no revolving credit loans or term loans shall remain outstanding after, and no revolving credit or term loan commitments shall be available afterMarch
 31,  2022.  Quarterly  principal  amortization  payments  of  the  term  loan  facilities  were  amended  to  be  5%  of  the  original  principal  amount  beginning  inSeptember
 2018 through December 2021, with the remaining balance due in March 2022. MGM  China permanently repaid $507 million of term loans for the yearended
 December  31,  2018  in  accordance  with  the  scheduled  amortization.  At  December  31,  2018,  $641  million  was  drawn  on  the  revolving  credit  facility.  AtDecember 31, 2018, the interes
t rate on the term loans was 4.74% and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 4.72%.76

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enac
ted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).The Tax
 Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that are generally applicable to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, including, but notlimited
 to,  (1)  reducing  the  U.S.  federal  corporate  tax  rate  from  35  percent  to  21  percent;  (2)  requiring  companies  to  pay  a  one-time  transition  tax  on  certainunrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.
S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) adding a new provisiondesigned
 to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction of up to 50 percentto offset
 the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (6) imposing additional limitations on thedeductibility of executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits; and (7) increasing bon
us depreciation to allow for full expensing of qualified property. 
The
 SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118provides
 a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.In accordance with SAB 118, a company must 
reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. Tothe
 extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record aprovisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it sho
uld continue toapply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the 
tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.  79

  
The
 Company’s  accounting  for  certain  elements  of  the  Tax  Act  was  incomplete  as  of  December  31,  2017.  However,  the  Company  was  able  to  makereasonable estimates
 of certain effects and, therefore, recorded a provisional discrete non-cash net tax benefit of $1.4 billion in the period ended December 31, 2017,consisting
 of a benefit of $988 million for the corporate rate reduction and a benefit of $438 million from its provisional re-assessment of the Tax Act’s impact onthe
 valuation allowance on its foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryovers. The Company did not provide tax expense for the transition tax on its unrepatriated earnings,which totaled $669 million withou
t regard to actual 2017 distributions of $62 million, because such earnings were fully offset by FTCs. 
The
 Company’s accounting for the impact of the Tax Act is now complete. The Company recorded non-cash income tax expense totaling $20 million duringthe measurement
 period in 2018, as it adjusted its valuation allowance on its FTC carryovers to account for guidance clarifying the treatment of FTCs resulting fromGILTI
 and other provisions impacting FTC utilization. These measurement period adjustments increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 3% during the yearended
 December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company finalized its accounting for the tax treatment of indirect costs of providing certain employee fringe benefitssubject
 to limitation under the Tax Act. This measurement period adjustment had an immaterial impact on the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,2018.
 
The
 Company has made an accounting policy decision to treat taxes due, if any, on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income under the GILTI provisions as acurrent period expense when in
curred. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a deferred tax liability for any GILTI taxes that may result in future periods. 
The
 Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $2.4 billion on its FTC carryover of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, resulting in an FTC netdeferred
 tax asset of $481 million. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGMGrand
 Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special GamingTax
 qualifies  as  a  tax  paid  in  lieu  of  an  income  tax  that  is  creditable  against  U.S.  taxes.  While  the  Company  generally  does  not  expect  to  generate  new  FTCcarryovers
 under the Tax Act, it will be able to utilize its existing FTC carryovers to the extent that it has active foreign source income during the 10-year FTCcarryforward
 period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of U.S. taxable income, of overall domestic losses that totaled $1.7 billion atDecember 31, 2018. The Compan
y relies on future U.S. source operating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTCrealization
 during the 10-year FTC carryover period. The FTC carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: $640 million in 2022; $976 million in 2023; $782million in 2024; $332 million 
in 2025; and $196 million in 2027. 
The
 Company’s assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S.operating
 profits and our interpretations of the Tax Act based upon guidance issued to date. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possibleneed
 for a valuation allowance and changes to such assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on theprovision for income taxes 
in the period including such change.   
Income
 generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  exempted  from  Macau’s  12%  complementary  tax,  pursuant  to  approval  from  theMacau
 government. Absent this exemption, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $43 million and $38 million in 2018and 2017, respectively, and dilu
ted earnings per share would have decreased by $0.08 and $0.07 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise has been granted an exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits through March 31, 2020, which is the endof
 the term of its current gaming sub-concession. The Company has assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12% complementary tax on gamingprofits for all periods b
eyond March 31, 2020 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
Non-gaming
 operations  remain  subject  to  the  Macau  complementary  tax.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  had  at  December  31,  2018  a  complementary  tax  netoperating
 loss carryforward of $866 million resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2019 through2021.
 
MGM
 Grand Paradise’s exemption from the 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGMChina.
 However, MGM Grand Paradise has had an agreement with the Macau government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by itsshareholder, MGM China, on distributions o
f its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment (“annual fee arrangement”) regardless of the amount of distributabledividends.
 Such annual fee arrangement was effective for distributions of profits earned through December 31, 2016. Since the earnings for 2017 were not coveredby an annual
 fee arrangement as of December 31, 2017, the Company provided deferred taxes on such earnings, which totaled $41 million as of December 31, 2017.On
 March 15, 2018, MGM Grand Paradise executed an extension of the annual fee arrangement, which covers the distributions of gaming profits earned for theperiod
 of January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2020. It requires annual payments of approximately $1 million for 2017 through 2019 and a payment of approximately$300,000
 for  the  first  quarter  2020.  The  Company  reversed  the  $41  million  of  deferred  taxes  previously  recorded  on  2017  earnings,  resulting  in  a  reduction  inprovision for income taxes 
for the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by the 2017 annual payment amount.80

  
The Company
 has net operating losses in certain of the states in which it operates that total $355 million as of December 31, 2018, which equates to deferredtax
 assets of $23 million after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2029 through2038. The Company has provided a valuation 
allowance of $3 million on certain of its state deferred tax assets, including the net operating losses described above. 
In
 addition, there is a valuation allowance of $26 million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on Hong Kong netoperating losses because th
e Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition. 
A reconciliation of the b
eginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
 total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $13 million and $11 million  at December 31, 2018and 2017, respectively.
 
The
 Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, which were not material as of December 31,2018,
 2017 or 2016. The Company does not anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 will change materially within thenext twelve months.
 
The
 Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the incometaxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 3
1, 2018, the IRS can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2014; however theIRS
 may  adjust  NOLs  generated  in  such  years  that  were  utilized  in  2014.  The  Company’s  2014  U.S.  consolidated  federal  income  tax  return  is  currently  underexamination
 by the IRS. The IRS examination of the 2014 U.S. income tax return of CityCenter Holdings, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnershipfor income tax purposes was comp
leted during 2018 and the Company’s share of the resultant adjustments were not material in the aggregate.   
As of
 December 31, 2018, other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above, the various state and local tax jurisdictions inwhich
 the Company files tax returns can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2014. However, such jurisdictions may adjust NOLs generated insuch years that are uti
lized in subsequent years. The Company’s state income tax returns filed in Mississippi and New Jersey for the tax years 2014 through 2016 andMichigan for the tax yea
rs 2014 through 2017 are currently under examination. No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination.

The
 table  above  excludes  the  Company’s  future  lease  obligations  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Operating  Partnership  pursuant  to  the  master  lease  agreementdiscussed in
 Note 17 as these lease obligations are eliminated in consolidation. Rental expense for operating leases was $89 million, $92 million and $80 million for2018,
 2017 and 2016, respectively, which included short-term rentals charged to rent expense. The Company’s operating leases are materially comprised of groundleases
 for  various  properties.  The  Company  accounts  for  the  Cotai  land  concession  contract  as  an  operating  lease  for  which  the  required  upfront  payments  areamortized over the in
itial 25-year contract term ending in January 2038. 
Additionally, the
 Company has a  series of ground leases for a total of approximately 11 acres of land on which the Borgata employee parking garage, publicspace
 expansion, rooms expansion, and modified surface parking lot reside. The Company recorded an unfavorable lease liability for the excess contractual leaseobligations
 over the market value of the leases, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contracts through December 2070. Theremaining balance of
 the unfavorable lease liability was $46 million and $47 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The ground lease is accountedfor as an operating lease.
 
Also, the Company has a ground lease agreement
 for an approximate 23-acre parcel of land at MGM National Harbor. The ground lease has an initial term of25
 years  and  the  right  to  extend  for  up  to  13  additional  six-year  periods  with  the  first  7  of  those  additional  periods  considered  to  be  reasonably  assured.  TheCompany therefore amort
izes the lease on a straight-line basis over a 67-year term to December 2082. 
October

1
litigation.
The  Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017shooting in Las
 Vegas. The matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues, each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seeking damagesfor
 emotional  distress,  physical  injury,  medical  expenses,  economic  damages  and/or  wrongful  death  based  on  assertions  that  the  Company  and/or  certain  of  itssubsidiaries
 were negligent.  The Company also received  letters  from  attorneys  purporting  to represent  other  persons with claims  related  to the October  1, 2017shooting.
 Lawsuits  were  first  filed  in  October  2017  and  include  actions  filed  by  multiple  individuals  in  the  District  Court  of  Clark  County,  Nevada  and  in  theSuperior
 Court of Los Angeles County, California. Some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismissed, and plaintiffs’ counsel indicate they anticipate re-filing
 the lawsuits in similar form. In June 2018, the Company removed to federal court all actions that remained pending in California and Nevada state courtsfollowing the voluntary dismissals.
 Motions to remand have been filed in several cases, and the Company anticipates that there may be additional motions to remandfiled
 in the future. The Company also initiated declaratory relief actions in federal courts in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent tosue.
 Additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future. In February of 2019, the Company and plaintiffs’ counsel commenced mediation of thesematters.  The above-descri
bed litigation currently is stayed pending mediation. 
The Company is currently unable to
 reliably predict the future developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of pending or futurelitigation related
 to this matter. The Company will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, newinformation
 and future circumstances. The Company intends to defend against these lawsuits and ultimately believes it should prevail, but litigation of this type isinherently
 unpredictable. Although there are significant procedural, factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect the Company’s belief as tothe
 possibility of liability, the Company currently believes that it is reasonably possible that it could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. Theforegoing
 determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liabilityon the part of the Company or any of
 its affiliates. Given that these cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, the Company doesnot
 currently  possess  sufficient  information  to  determine  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  liability.  In  the  event  the  Company  incurs  any  liability,  the  Companybelieves
 it  is  unlikely  it  would  incur  losses  in  connection  with  these  claims  in  excess  of  its  insurance  coverage.  The  insurance  carriers  have  not  expressed  areservation
 of rights  or coverage  defense that  affects  the Company’s evaluation  of potential  losses in connection  with these  claims.  In addition,  the Company’sgeneral
 liability insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual “duty to defend”, payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend coveredlawsuits
 that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. Payment of such fees and costs is in addition to (and not limited by) the limits of theinsurance policies and 
does not erode the total liability coverage available.

 Other
litigation
.
 The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routi ne  matters incidental to its business. Management doesnot believe that the out
come of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows .  
Borgata

property
tax
reimbursement
agreement.
On  February 15, 2017, Borgata, the Department of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey andAtlantic
 City entered into an agreement wherein Borgata was to be reimbursed $72 million as settlement for property tax refunds in satisfaction of New Jersey TaxCourt
 and Superior Court judgments totaling approximately $106 million, plus interest for the 2009-2012 tax years and the settlement of pending tax appeals for thetax
 years 2013-2015. Those pending tax appeals could potentially have resulted in Borgata being awarded additional refunds due of approximately $65 million. InJune
 2017, Atlantic City and the State of New Jersey issued bonds and used the proceeds to pay the $72 million settlement in full. The Company recorded theamounts
 received pursuant to the reimbursement agreement as an offset to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Asrequired
 by the purchase and sale agreement to acquire Borgata in August 2016, the Company paid Boyd Gaming half of the settlement amount received by theCompany,
 net  of  fees  and  expenses.  Amounts  paid  to  Boyd  Gaming  were  recorded  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  ofoperations.
 
NV

Energy.
In  July 2016, the Company filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and now purchases energy, capacity, and/orancillary
 services from a provider other than NV Energy. The Company paid an upfront impact payment of $83 million, including $14 million related to CityCenter,in September 2016.
 Under the terms of the exit agreement, the Company and CityCenter were required to make ongoing payments to NV Energy for non-bypassablerate
 charges, which primarily relate to each entity’s share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts which extended through 2040 and each entity’sshare
 of  the  costs  of  decommissioning  and  remediation  of  coal-fired  power  plants  in  Nevada.  The  Company’s  initial  estimate  of  its  obligation  related  to  non-bypassable
 charges  was  $71  million.  The  expense  recognized  related  to  the  upfront  payment  and  the  initial  accrual  for  the  liability  associated  with  the  non-bypassable
 charges was recorded within “NV Energy exit expense” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.Subsequent accretion
 of the liability and changes in estimates are recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.In
 the second quarter of 2017, the terms of the ongoing impact fee obligations were modified. Such modifications included a credit to be applied against future non-bypassable
 rate charges and substantially shortened the period over which the Company and CityCenter are responsible for such charges, with an end date in 2022.As
 such,  the  Company  recognized  a  reduction  in  its  liability  for  future  charges  of  $41  million  with  a  corresponding  credit  to  “NV  Energy  exit  expense”.Additionally,
 CityCenter recorded an $8 million reduction in liability and credit to expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has recorded anestimate
 of its remaining liability on a discounted basis of $8 million and $10 million, respectively, in “Other accrued liabilities” and $15 million and $23 million,respectively, in “Other 
long-term obligations.” 
Grand

Paradise
Macau
deferred
cash
payment.
On  September  1,  2016,  the  Company  purchased  188.1  million  common  shares  of  its  MGM  Chinasubsidiary
 from  Grand  Paradise  Macau  (“GPM”),  an  entity  controlled  by  Ms.  Ho,  Pansy  Catilina  Chiu  King  (“Ms.  Ho”).  As  part  of  the  consideration  for  thepurchase,
 the Company agreed to pay GPM or its nominee a deferred cash payment of $50 million, which will be paid in amounts equal to the ordinary dividendsreceived on such shares, with a final lump sum payment due o
n the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction if any portion of the deferred cash paymentremains
 unpaid at that time. In 2018 and 2017, the total amount paid under the deferred cash payment arrangement was $11 million and $7 million, respectively.Such
 amount was paid to Expert Angles Limited, an entity controlled by Ms. Ho through November 2018 and subsequently controlled by an immediate familymember of Ms. Ho. As of December 31, 2018, the Comp
any recorded a remaining liability on a discounted basis of $36 million in “Other long-term obligations.”  
Other

guarantees.
The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  various  guarantee  contracts  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  which  are  generallysupported
 by letters of credit issued by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $250million,
 the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility limits the amount to $75 million, and MGM China’s credit facility limits the amount to $100 million. AtDecember
 31, 2018, $12 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the Company’s senior credit facility. No letters of credit were outstanding under theOperating
 Partnership senior credit facility or MGM China’s credit facility at December 31, 2018. The amount of available borrowings under each of the creditfacilities is redu
ced by any outstanding letters of credit.

PLANS 
Multiemployer

benefit
plans.
The  Company currently participates in multiemployer pension plans in which the risks of participating differs from single-employer plans in the fol
lowing aspects: 
 
a) Assets contributed to the mul tiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; 
b) If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; 
c) If  an entity chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the entity may be required to pay those plans an amount based on theunderfunded status of the plan, 
referred to as a withdrawal liability; and 
d) If  the plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawal liabilitypayments, employers are re
quired by law to make up the insufficient difference.

SEGMENT
INFORMATION
The
 Company’s management views each of its casino resorts as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economiccharacteristics,
 types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reportingstructure.
 During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company changed its reportable segments to Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. Thischange of reportable seg
ments reflects realignment within the Company stemming from the expansion of the Company’s regional operations.Las

Vegas
Strip
Resorts.
  Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature),Mandalay
 Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including the Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad LasVegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas.
Regional

Operations.

 Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; andMGM Springfield in Springfield, Massa
chusetts (upon commencing operations in August 2018).MGM
China.
  MGM China consists of MGM Macau and MGM Cotai (upon comm encing operations in February 2018).The
 Company’s  operations  related  to  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  MGP’s  Northfield  casino,  and  certain  other  corporate  operations  andmanagement
 services have not been identified as separate reportable segments; therefore, these operations are included in “Corporate and other” in the followingsegment disclosures to re
concile to consolidated results.The
 Company’s management utilizes Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary profit measure for its reportable segments. Adjusted Property EBITDA is ameasure
 defined as Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each property. Adjusted EBITDA is ameasure
 defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, NVEnergy exit expense, gain on Borgat
a transaction, and property transactions, net.88

 The
 following  tables  present  the  Company’s  segment  information.  As  a  result  of  the  change  in  reportable  segments  described  above, we  have  recastpreviously reported segmen

As
 further described in Note 1, pursuant to the master lease, the tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-NewYork, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunic
a, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata and MGM National Harbor from the landlord. 
The
 master lease has an initial lease term of ten years that began on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM National Harbor, as described below)with the
 potential to extend the term for four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the tenant. The master lease provides that any extension of its termmust
 apply to all of the real estate under the master lease at the time of the extension. The master lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the tenant to paysubstantially all
 costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, themaster lease
 provides the landlord with a right of first offer with respect to MGM Springfield, which the landlord may exercise should the Company elect to sell thisproperty in
 the future. In connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, the master lease was amended to provide that the initial term with respect to MGMNational
 Harbor ends on April 31, 2024. Thereafter, the initial term of the master lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of thetenant for
 an initial renewal period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the master lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether theCompany
 elects to renew the other properties under the master lease in connection with the expiration of the initial ten-year term). If, however, the tenant choosesnot to
 renew the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under the master lease, the tenant would also lose the rightto renew the master lease 
with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial ten-year lease term ends related to the rest of the properties in 2026. 
In
 connection with the commencement of the third lease year on April 1, 2018, annual rent payments under the master lease increased to $770 million from$757
 million.  Rent  under  the  master  lease  consists  of  a  “base  rent”  component  and  a  “percentage  rent”  component.  As  of  December  31,  2018,  the  base  rentrepresents approximately 90% of the rent payments due under the master lease and the percentage rent represents approximatel
y 10% of the rent payments due underthe
 master lease. The  master lease also provides for fixed annual escalators of 2% on the base rent through the sixth lease year and the possibility for additional 2%increases
 thereafter subject to the tenant meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as well as potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every fiveyears
 thereafter based on a percentage of average actual annual net revenue during the preceding five year period calculated in accordance with the terms under themaster lease. 
The  master lease also contains customary events of default and financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants asof December 31, 2018.
 
Subsequent
 to the Company completing its acquisition of Empire City in January 2019, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with EmpireCity
 from  the  Company  for  consideration  of  approximately  $634  million.  The  real  estate  assets  of  Empire  City  will  be  leased  to  the  Company  pursuant  to  anamendment
 to the master lease, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the masterlease
 terms, 90 percent of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2 percent per year until 2022. In addition, the master lease provides the landlord with aright
 of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent the Company develops additional gaming facilities, which thelandlord may exercise shou
ld the Company elect to sell this property in the future.  Additionally, in September 2018, th
e Company entered into a definitive agreement with MGP to acquire Northfield OpCo from MGP for approximately $275million, subject
 to customary purchase price adjustments. The real estate assets of Northfield will be leased to the Company pursuant to an amendment to the masterlease,
 increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $60 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90 percent ofthis
 rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2 percent per year until 2022. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customaryclosing conditions.
 
Also,
 in  December  2018,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  MGP  whereby  MGP  will  pay  the  Company  consideration  of  $638  million  forrenovations
 undertaken by the Company regarding the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”). Additionally, at closing,the parties
 will enter into an amendment to the master lease whereby the annual rent payment to MGP will increase by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of thelease
 year. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022. The transaction is expected toclose in the first quar
ter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions.91

 All
 intercompany  transactions,  including  transactions  under  the  master  lease,  have  been  eliminated  in  the  Company’s  consolidation  of  MGP. The  publicownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recognized 
as non-controlling interests in the Com pany’s consolidated financ ial statements.

FINANCIAL
INFORMATION 
As
 of December 31, 2018, all of the Company’s principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of its material domestic subsidiaries, other than MGPand
 the  Operating  Partnership,  MGM  Grand  Detroit,  MGM  National  Harbor,  MGM  Springfield,  and  each  of  their  respective  subsidiaries.  The  Company’sinternational
 subsidiaries, including MGM China and its subsidiaries, are not guarantors of such indebtedness. Separate condensed financial statement informationfor
 the subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, are presentedbelow.
 Within the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows, the Company has presented net changes in intercompany accounts as investing activities ifthe applicable entities have a
 net asset in intercompany accounts and as a financing activity if the applicable entities have a net intercompany liability balance. 
Certain
 of the Company’s subsidiaries  collectively  own Operating Partnership  units and each subsidiary  accounts for its respective  investment  under theequity
 method  within  the  condensed  consolidating  financial  information  presented  below.  For  these  subsidiaries,  such  investment  constitutes  continuinginvolvement,
 and accordingly, the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets under the master lease do not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting. The real estateassets
 are reflected in the balance sheets of the applicable MGM subsidiaries. In addition, such subsidiaries recognized finance liabilities within “Other long-termobligations” related 
to rent payments due under the master lease and recognized the related interest expense component of such payments. These real estate assets arealso
 reflected on the balance sheet of the MGP subsidiary that received such assets. The condensed consolidating financial information presented below thereforeincludes
 the accounting for such activity within the respective columns presented and in the elimination column. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, theCompany
 is  reassessing  whether  the  sale  and  leaseback  of  the  real  estate  assets  under  the  master  lease  now  qualify  as  a  passed  sale  and,  accordingly,  thecorresponding lease class
ification, both of which could impact the condensed consolidating financial information.92

DESCRIPTION
OF
REGULAT
ION
AND
LICENSING 
The
 gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subjectto
 extensive  regulation  under  the  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  of  the  jurisdiction  where  it  is  located.  These  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  generally  concern  theresponsibility,
 financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in onejurisdiction could resul
t in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. 
In
 addition to gaming regulations, our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the countries and states in which weoperate.
 These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions  and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental  matters,employment
 and  immigration,  currency  transactions,  taxation,  zoning  and  building  codes,  land  use,  marketing  and  advertising,  timeshare,  lending,  privacy,telemarketing,
 regulations  applicable  under  the  Office  of  Foreign  Asset  Control,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  the  various  reporting  and  anti-moneylaundering
 regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Anymaterial
 changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business andoperating results.

Nevada
Government
Regulation
 
The
 ownership  and  operation  of  our  casino  gaming  facilities  in  Nevada  are  subject  to  the  Nevada  Gaming  Control  Act  and  the  regulations  promulgatedthereunder
 (collectively, the “Nevada Act”), and various local regulations. Our gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the NevadaGaming
 Commission (the “Nevada Commission”), the Nevada Gaming Control Board (the “Nevada Board”), and various county and city licensing agencies (the“local authorities
”). The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, and the local authorities are collectively referred to as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.” 
The
 laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with,among other things:
 
 
• the prevention of unsavory or unsui table persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
• the establishment and m aintenance of responsible accounting practices; 
 
• the  maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscalaffairs and the safegu
arding of assets and revenues; 
 
• providing reliable re cord keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; 
 
• the prevention of cheat ing and fraudulent practices; and 
 
• providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. 
Any change in the laws, regulations, 
and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations. 
Each
 of  our  subsidiaries  that  currently  operate  casinos  in  Nevada  (collectively,  the  “Nevada  casino  licensees”)  is  required  to  be  licensed  by  the  NevadaGaming
 Authorities. Each gaming license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable. MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, New York-New YorkHotel
 & Casino, LLC, Bellagio, LLC, MGM Resorts Manufacturing Corp., and Aria Resort & Casino, LLC are also licensed as manufacturers and distributors ofgaming
 devices  (collectively,  the  “Nevada  manufacturer  and  distributor  licensees”).  Certain  of  our  subsidiaries  have  also  been  licensed  or  found  suitable  asshareholders, members, or general partners,
 as relevant, of the Nevada casino licensees and of the Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees. The Nevada casinolicensees, Nevada manufact
urer and distributor licensees, and the foregoing subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Nevada licensed subsidiaries.” 
We,
 along with Mandalay Resort Group, are required to be registered by the Nevada Commission as publicly traded corporations (collectively, the “Nevadaregistered
 corporations”) and Mirage Resorts, Incorporated is required to be registered as an intermediary company and, as such, each of us is required periodicallyto submit detailed financial
 and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require. No personmay become a stockholder or
 

 member
 of,  or  receive  any  percentage  of  profits  from,  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  without  first  registering  with  (for  equity  ownership  of  5%  or  less),  orobtaining
 licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Additionally, the local authorities have taken the position that they have the authority toapprove
 all  persons  owning  or  controlling  the  stock  of  any  corporation  controlling  a  gaming  licensee.  The  Nevada  registered  corporations,  Mirage  Resorts,Incorporated
 and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries have obtained from the Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits, and licensesrequired in order to engag
e in gaming activities in Nevada. 
The
 Nevada Gaming  Authorities  may investigate  any individual  who has a material  relationship  to, or material  involvement  with,  the Nevada registeredcorporations
 or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaminglicensee.
 Officers, directors, and certain key employees of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may berequired
 to  be  licensed  by  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities.  Officers,  directors,  and  key  employees  of  the  Nevada  registered  corporations  who  are  actively  anddirectly
 involved in the gaming activities of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.The
 Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an application for licensing or a finding of suitability for any cause they deem reasonable. A finding of suitability iscomparable to licens
ing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant for licensingor
 a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the investigation.Changes
 in  licensed  positions  must  be  reported  to  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities,  and,  in  addition  to  their  authority  to  deny  an  application  for  a  finding  ofsuitability or licensu
re, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. 
If
 the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with theNevada
 registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries, such Nevada registered corporations or Nevada licensed subsidiaries, as applicable, would haveto
 sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiariesto
 terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are notsubject to judicial r
eview in Nevada. 
The
 Nevada  registered  corporations  and  the  Nevada  casino  licensees  are  required  to  submit  detailed  financial  and  operating  reports  to  the  NevadaCommission.
 Substantially all of the Nevada registered corporations’ and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries’ material loans, leases, sales of securities, and similarfinancing transactions 
must be reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission. 
If
 the Nevada Commission determined that we or a Nevada licensed subsidiary violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend, or revoke, subjectto compliance with certain
 statutory and regulatory procedures, our gaming licenses and those of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries. In addition, the Nevada registeredcorporations
 and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at thediscretion
 of the Nevada Commission. Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the gaming establishments and, under certaincircumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’
s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the gaming establishments) could be forfeited to theState
 of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning, or suspension of any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming licensewould) materially adve
rsely affect our gaming operations. 
Any beneficial
 holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have hisor
 her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise beinconsistent
 with  the  declared  policies  of  the  State  of  Nevada.  The  applicant  must  pay  all  costs  of  investigation  incurred  by  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  inconducting any such investigat
ion. 
The
 Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission.The
 Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitabilitywithin
 30 days after the Chair of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” as definedin the Nevada
 Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver ofsuch
 finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waivermay, in certain cir
cumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver. 
An
 institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary courseof
 business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors,any
 change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies, or operations, or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Commissionfinds to be inconsistent with hold
ing our 
2

 voting securities for inv
estment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 
 
• voting on all matters vot ed on by stockholders; 
 
• making  financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause achange in its managemen
t, policies, or operations; and 
 
• such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
If
 the beneficial holder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, or trust, it must submit detailed business and financialinformation including a 
list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation. 
Any person who
 fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or theChair
 of the Nevada Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with investigation of itsapplication,
 may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Anystockholder
 found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribedby the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We
 will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be astockholder or to have any othe
r relationship with us or a Nevada licensed subsidiary, we or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries: 
 
• pays that person any dividend or in terest upon any of our voting securities; 
 
• allows that person to exerc ise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; 
 
• pays remuneration in any fo rm to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or 
 
• fails  to  pursue  all  lawful  efforts  to  require  such  unsuitable  person  to  relinquish  his  or  her  voting  securities  including  if  necessary,  the  immediatepurchase of the voting secur
ities for cash at fair market value. 
The
 Nevada  Commission  may,  in  its  discretion,  require  the  holder  of  any  debt  security  of  the  Nevada  registered  corporations  to  file  an  application,  beinvestigated, and
 be found suitable to hold the debt security. If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant tothe Nevada Act, the registe
red corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it: 
 
• pays to the unsuitable person any d ividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; 
 
• recognizes any voting right by su ch unsuitable person in connection with such securities; 
 
• pays the unsuitable person re muneration in any form; or 
 
• makes any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction. 
We
 are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are heldin
 trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failureto
 make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity ofthe
 beneficial owner. The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Nevada registered corporations’ stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that suchsecurities are subje
ct to the Nevada Act. However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Nevada registered corporations. 
The
 Nevada registered corporations may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securitiesor
 the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for thosepurposes or for similar purpos
es. An approval, if given, does not 
3

 constitute
 a  finding,  recommendation,  or  approval  by  the  Nevada  Commission  or  the  Nevada  Board  as  to  the  accuracy  or  adequacy  of  the  prospectus  or  theinvestment merits of 
the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. 
On
 July 27, 2017, the Nevada Commission granted the Nevada registered corporations prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years,subject to certain cond
itions. 
Changes
 in control of the Nevada registered corporations through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements,or any act
 or conduct by a person whereby he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Entities seeking to acquirecontrol
 of a registered corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming controlof the registered corporation. The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stock
holders, officers, directors, and other persons having a material relationshipor involvement with the ent
ity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction. 
The
 Nevada legislature  has declared  that some corporate  acquisitions  opposed by management, repurchases  of voting securities, and corporate  defensivetactics
 affecting Nevada gaming licensees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations may be injurious to stable and productive corporategaming.
 The  Nevada  Commission  has  established  a  regulatory  scheme  to  ameliorate  the  potentially  adverse  effects  of  these  business  practices  upon  Nevada’sgaming industry and to furthe
r Nevada’s policy to: 
 
• assure the financial stability  of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates; 
 
• preserve the benefic ial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and 
 
• promote a neutral environme nt for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. 
Approvals
 are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above thecurrent
 market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan ofrecapitalization
 proposed by a registered corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the registered corporation’s stockholders forthe purpose of acquiring cont
rol of that corporation. 
License
 fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the localauthorities. Depending upon the pa
rticular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either: 
 
• a percentage of the gross revenues received; 
 
• the number of gaming devic es operated; or 
 
• the number of table gam es operated. 
The
 tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75%. A live entertainment tax is also paid on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms oflive entertainmen
t are provided. The Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada. 
Because
 we are involved in gaming ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fundin
 the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Board of our participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject toincrease
 or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by theNevada Act. We would be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if we: 
 
• knowingly violate any laws of the fo reign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation; 
 
• fail to conduct the for eign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations; 
 
4

  
• engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unrea sonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflectsor tends to reflect dis
credit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada; 
 
• engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or 
 
• employ,  contract with, or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevadaon the ground of personal unsuitabi
lity, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling. 
The
 sale of alcoholic beverages by the Nevada licensed subsidiaries is subject to licensing, control, and regulation by the applicable local authorities. Alllicenses
 are  revocable  and  are  not  transferable.  The  agencies  involved  have  full  power  to  limit,  condition,  suspend,  or  revoke  any  such  license,  and  any  suchdisciplinary action cou
ld (and revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
Michigan
Government
Regulation
and
Taxation
 
The
 Michigan  Gaming  Control  and  Revenue  Act  (the  “Michigan  Act”)  subjects  the  owners  and  operators  of  casino  gaming  facilities  to  extensive  statelicensing
 and regulatory requirements. The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any suchlocal
 ordinances regulating casino gaming are consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it. We are subject to the Michigan Act throughour ownership interest in MGM Grand Detro
it, LLC (the “licensed subsidiary”) which operates MGM Grand Detroit. Our ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit,LLC is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary MGM Grand Detroi
t, Inc. 
The
 Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board (the “Michigan Board”) and authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than threeapplicants
 who  have  entered  into  development  agreements  with  the  City  of  Detroit.  The  Michigan  Board  is  granted  extensive  authority  to  conduct  backgroundinvestigations and determine the suitability of casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors, or managerial employees of applicants and affiliated
companies and
 persons or entities holding a one percent or greater direct or indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated company. Institutional investors holding lessthan
 certain specified amounts of our debt or equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements of the Michigan Act since we are a publiclytraded
 corporation, and provided that the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affecting our affairs. Anyperson
 who supplies goods or services to the licensed subsidiary which are directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, and any person whosupplies
 other goods or services to the licensed subsidiary on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from the Michigan Board. In addition,any
 individual employed by the licensed subsidiary or by a supplier licensee whose work duties are related to or involved in the gaming operation or are performedin a restricted ar
ea or a gaming area of the licensed subsidiary must obtain an occupational license from the Michigan Board. 
The
 Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license. The applicantmust
 establish  its  suitability  as  to  integrity,  moral  character  and  reputation,  business  probity,  financial  ability  and  experience,  responsibility,  and  other  criteriadeemed
 appropriate by the Michigan Board. A casino license is valid for a period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determinationthat the licensee no long
er meets the requirements for licensure. 
The
 Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict the licensed subsidiary’s casino license. The licensed subsidiary is also subject tofines
 or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming or liquor control laws or rules. In the event that the licensed subsidiary’s license is revoked or suspended formore
 than 120 days, the Michigan Act provides for the appointment of a conservator who, among other things, is required to preserve the assets to ensure that theyshall
 continue to be operated in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the Michigan Board, to sell or otherwise transfer the assets to another person orentity who meets the requi
rements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain approvals and consultations. 
The
 Michigan Board has adopted administrative  rules to implement the terms of the Michigan Act. Among other things, the rules impose more detailedsubstantive and procedural 
requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations. 
Included
 are requirements regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the MichiganBoard,
 internal control and accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownershipinterests in licensed 
casinos. The rules also establish numerous 
5

 Michigan
 Board  procedures  regarding  licensing,  disciplinary  and  other  hearings,  and  similar  matters.  The  rules  have  the  force  of  law  and  are  binding  on  theMichigan Board as well as on appli
cants for or holders of casino licenses. 
Under
 rules of the Michigan Board, a person or company which intends to acquire shares representing more than a 5% equity interest in a publicly tradedcompany
 which  is  the  holding  company  of  a  Michigan  casino  licensee  must  obtain  approval  of  the  acquisition  from  the  Michigan  Board.  Subsequent  to  theacquisition, the person or
 company acquiring the shares must be determined by the Michigan Board to be “suitable” and “qualified” to own the shares. In addition, ifthe
 acquisition  is  by  a  company,  “key  persons”  in  the  company  (generally  the  officers,  directors,  managerial  employees,  and  significant  owners)  must  also  bedetermined
 to  be  “suitable”  and  “qualified.”  “Institutional  investors”  (as  that  term  is  defined  in  the  Michigan  Act)  may  generally  obtain  a  waiver  from  theserequirements
 if the institutional investor has less than 15% ownership interest in the publicly traded company. Upon attaining equity ownership of 5% or more, orfiling
 Schedule 13D or 13G with the SEC, the Michigan Board must be notified by the investor. Unless otherwise ordered by the Michigan Board, institutionalinvestors
 acquiring less than 10% equity ownership in the publicly traded company are entitled to an exemption from the approval requirements, but are required tofile
 an institutional  waiver application  with the Michigan Board. Institutional  investors acquiring  10% or more equity  ownership must apply for an institutionalwaiver,
 supplying certain information delineated in Rule 504(3). Pursuant to Rule 504(4), institutional investors acquiring more than 15% equity ownership mustapply to
 the Michigan Board for approval of the acquisition within 45 days after it occurs. The institutional investor and its key persons may be subject to suitabilityand qualification det
erminations. 
The
 term “institutional investor” includes financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, etc. The shares held by the institutionalinvestor must
 be held for investment purposes only. The following activities are deemed consistent with holding the shares for investment purposes: voting by proxyfurnished
 by the board of directors, on all matters voted on by the holders of the voting securities; serving as a member of a committee of creditors or securityholders
 formed  in  connection  with  a  debt  restructuring;  nominating  a  candidate  for  election  or  appointment  to  the  board  of  directors  in  connection  with  a  debtrestructuring;
 accepting appointment or election as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until theconclusion of the member’s term; making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for information purp
oses andnot to cause a change in its 
management, policies, or operations; and other activities that the board determines to be consistent with the investment intent. 
The
 Michigan  Liquor  Control  Commission  licenses,  controls  and  regulates  the  sale  of  alcoholic  beverages  by  the  licensed  subsidiary  pursuant  to  theMichigan
 Liquor Control Code of 1998. The Michigan Act also requires that the licensed subsidiary sell in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor ControlCode.
 
The
 Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification and Compliance.”The
 ordinance authorizes casino gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a development agreement which has beenapproved
 and certified by the City Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of such parties. The development agreement among the City of Detroit,MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Economic Develop
ment Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently in effect. Under theordinance,
 the  licensed  subsidiary  is  required  to  submit  to  the  Mayor  of  Detroit  and  to  the  City  Council  periodic  reports  regarding  its  compliance  with  thedevelopment
 agreement or, in the event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply. The ordinance requires the Mayorof
 Detroit to monitor each casino operator’s compliance with its development agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of default and to notifythe
 City Council of defaults and enforcement action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice of suchaction
 to the Michigan Board within five business days along with Detroit’s request that the Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s casino license. If adevelopment agreemen
t is terminated, the Michigan Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit. 
The
 administrative rules of the Michigan Board prohibit the licensed subsidiary or us from entering into a debt transaction affecting the capitalization orfinancial viabili
ty of MGM Grand Detroit without prior approval from the Michigan Board. 
The Michigan
 Act effectively provides for a wagering tax equal to 19% of adjusted gross receipts from gaming operations conducted at a casino. Proceeds ofthe wagering tax
 are shared between the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit. In addition to the wagering tax, the Michigan Act establishes an annual municipalservice
 fee equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of adjusted gross receipts to be paid to Detroit to defray its cost of hosting casinos, and an annual assessment,as
 adjusted  annually  based  upon  a  consumer  price  index,  in  the  initial  amount  of  approximately  $8.3  million  to  be  paid  to  Michigan  to  defray  its  regulatoryenforcement
 and  other  casino-related  costs.  These  payments  are  in  addition  to  the  taxes,  fees  and  assessments  customarily  paid  by  business  entities  situated  inDetroit.
 The licensed subsidiary is also obligated to pay 1% of its adjusted gross receipts to Detroit, to be increased to 2% of its adjusted gross receipts in anycalendar year in which ad
justed gross receipts exceed $400 million.

 Mississippi
Government
Regulation
 
We
 conduct  our  Mississippi  gaming  operations  through  two  indirect  subsidiaries,  Beau  Rivage  Resorts,  LLC  which  operates  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,Mississippi,
 and MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC, which operates the Gold Strike Casino in Tunica County, Mississippi (collectively, the “casino licensees”). Theoperation
 of casino facilities in Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the MississippiGaming Commission and the Mississippi Dep
artment of Revenue. 
The
 Mississippi  Gaming  Control  Act  (the  “Mississippi  Act”)  legalized  casino  gaming  in  Mississippi.  The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  adoptedregulations in further
ance of the Mississippi Act. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to: 
 
• prevent unsavory or unsuitable p ersons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
• establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; 
 
• maintain  effective  control  over  the  financial  practices  of  licensees,  including  establishing  minimum  procedures  for  internal  fiscal  affairs  andsafeguarding of assets and r
evenues, providing reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission; 
 
• prevent cheating and fr audulent practices; 
 
• provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and 
 
• ensure that gaming lic ensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. 
The
 regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or theMississippi
 Gaming Commission’s interpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have amaterial adverse 
effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations. 
The
 Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only ifthe voters
 in such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. As of December 31, 2017, gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties inthe
 state and gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties. Prior to Hurricane Katrina,Mississippi
 law required that gaming vessels be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in thewaters
 of the State of Mississippi lying south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, changes to the lawbecame
 effective which allowed gaming facilities to be constructed on land in the three Gulf Coast counties, provided that no portion of the gaming facilities islocated
 more than 800 feet from the mean high water line of the Mississippi Sound or designated bays on the Sound. The 800-foot limit does not apply to non-gaming
 facilities. The law permits unlimited stakes gaming on permanently moored dockside vessels or in land-based facilities on a 24-hour basis and does notrestrict the perc
entage of space which may be utilized for gaming. There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi. 
The
 casino  licensees  are  subject  to  the  licensing  and  regulatory  control  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.  Gaming  licenses  require  the  periodicpayment
 of fees and taxes and are not transferable. Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter. Thecurrent license of
 Beau Rivage Resorts, LLC is effective through April 20, 2019 and the current license of MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC. is effective through June22, 2021.
 
We
 are registered by the Mississippi Gaming Commission under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of the casino licensees. As aregistered publicly traded
 corporation, we are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and are required to periodicallysubmit
 detailed  financial,  operating  and  other  reports  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  and  furnish  any  other  information  which  the  Mississippi  GamingCommission may
 require. If we are unable to satisfy the registration requirements of the Mississippi Act, we and our casino licensees cannot own or operate gamingfacilities
 in  Mississippi.  The  casino  licensees  are  also  required  to  periodically  submit  detailed  financial,  operating  and  other  reports  to  the  Mississippi  GamingCommission
 and the Mississippi Department of Revenue and to furnish any other information required thereby. With certain exceptions, no person may become astockholder
 of  or  receive  any  percentage  of  profits  from  the  casino  licensees  without  first  obtaining  licenses  and  approvals  from  the  Mississippi  GamingCommission.

 Certain
 of our officers, directors and employees must be found suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We believe that we haveapplied
 for all necessary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additionalpersons
 to file applications for findings of suitability. In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be foundsuitable,
 in which case those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation. A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personaland
 financial information followed by a thorough investigation. There can be no assurance that a person who is subject to a finding of suitability will be foundsuitable
 by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that itdeems reasonable. Findings of sui
tability must be periodically renewed. 
Changes in certain licens
ed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. In addition to its authority to deny an application for a findingof
 suitability,  the Mississippi Gaming Commission  has jurisdiction  to disapprove a change in a licensed  position.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission  has thepower
 to  require  us  to  suspend  or  dismiss  officers,  directors  and  other  key  employees  or  sever  relationships  with  other  persons  who  refuse  to  file  appropriateapplications or whom
 the authorities find unsuitable to act in their capacities. 
Employees
 associated with gaming must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension. The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse toissue
 a  work  permit  to  a  person  convicted  of  a  felony  and  it  may  refuse  to  issue  a  work  permit  to  a  gaming  employee  if  the  employee  has  committed  variousmisdemeanors or knowingly viola
ted the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause. 
At
 any  time,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  the  power  to  investigate  and  require  a  finding  of  suitability  of  any  of  our  record  or  beneficialstockholders,
 regardless  of  the  percentage  of  ownership.  Mississippi  law  requires  any  person  who  acquires  more  than  5%  of  our  voting  securities  to  report  theacquisition to the
 Mississippi Gaming Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable. Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of morethan
 10%  of  our  voting  securities,  as  reported  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission,  must  apply  for  a  finding  of  suitability  by  the  Mississippi  GamingCommission. An applicant for find
ing of suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation. 
The
 Mississippi Gaming Commission has generally exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of aregistered
 public or private company’s voting securities. However, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has adopted a regulation that permits certain institutionalinvestors
 to own beneficially up to 25% and, under certain circumstances, up to 29%, of a registered or licensed company’s voting securities without a finding ofsuitability.
 Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for awaiver
 of a finding of suitability if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 25% (or, in certain circumstances, up to 29%) of the voting securities of aregistered
 or  licensed  company,  and  (ii)  holds  the  voting  securities  for  investment  purposes  only.  An  institutional  investor  shall  not  be  deemed  to  hold  votingsecurities
 for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not forthe purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election
 of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered or licensed company, any change inthe
 registered or licensed company’s corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public or private company or any of its gamingaffiliates,
 or any other action which the Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered or licensed company’s voting securitiesfor investment purposes only.
 
Activities that are no
t deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 
 
• voting, directly  or indirectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of such votingsecurities;
 
 
• serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
• nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
• accepting appointment or electi on (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with adebt restructuring and se
rving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s term; 
 
• making  financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause achange in management, pol
icies or operations; and 
 
• such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
 
8

 If a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partner
ship or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list ofbeneficial
 owners. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registeredpublic company’s equity int
erests for any cause it deems reasonable. 
We
 may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any of our debt or other securities. Inaddition,
 under the Mississippi Act, the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders of our debt securities to file applications, investigatethe holders, and require th
e holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities. 
Although
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and foundsuitable,
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debtinstrument
 exercises  a  material  influence  over  the  gaming  operations  of  the  entity  in  question.  Any  holder  of  debt  securities  required  to  apply  for  a  finding  ofsuitability must pay al
l investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation. 
Any
 person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi GamingCommission may be
 found unsuitable. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond the timethat
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor. After receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a holderof our debt securities or 
to have any other relationship with us, we will be subject to disciplinary action if we: 
 
• pay the unsuitable person any div idend, interest or other distribution whatsoever; 
 
• recognize the exerc ise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person; 
 
• pay the unsuitable person any r emuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances; 
 
• make any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or 
 
• fail  to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself or herself of the securities, including, if necessary, the immediatepurchase of the securities
 for cash at a fair market value. 
The
 casino  licensees  must  maintain  in  Mississippi  a  current  ledger  with  respect  to  the  ownership  of  their  equity  securities  and  we  must  maintain  inMississippi
 a current list of our stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by us. The ledger andstockholder
 lists must be available for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time. If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by anominee, the record
 holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. A failure to make that disclosuremay be grounds for finding the r
ecord holder unsuitable. We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. 
The
 Mississippi Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend to the general effect that thesecurities
 are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. On May 28, 2009, the Mississippi Gaming Commissiongranted
 us a waiver of this legend requirement. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of oursecurities at any time.
 
Substantially all loans, leases, sales of
 securities and similar financing transactions by the casino licensees must be reported to or approved by the MississippiGaming
 Commission.  The  licensed  subsidiaries  may  not  make  a  public  offering  of  their  securities,  but  may  pledge  or  mortgage  casino  facilities  with  the  priorapproval
 of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.  We  may  not  make  a  public  offering  of  our  securities  without  the  prior  approval  of  the  Mississippi  GamingCommission
 if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or toretire or
 extend obligations incurred for those purposes. The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of theprospectus or
 the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. Effective June 23, 2015, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiver of theprior
 approval requirement for our securities offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions. The waiver may be rescinded for good cause withoutprior notice upon the issuanc
e of an interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. 
 
9

 Under the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming
 Commission, the casino licensees may not guarantee a security issued by us pursuant to a public offering, orpledge
 their assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security issued by us, without the prior approval of the MississippiGaming
 Commission. Similarly, we may not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of the casino licensees, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interestsforeclose
 on such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued byus
 and agreements not to encumber such securities granted by us are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The waiver ofthe
 prior approval requirement for our securities offerings received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission effective June 23, 2015 includes a waiver of the priorapproval requirement 
for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions of the casino licensees, subject to certain conditions. 
We
 cannot change our control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover withoutthe
 prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, andother
 persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approvalprocess relating to the 
transaction. 
The
 Mississippi  Legislature  has  declared  that  some  corporate  acquisitions  opposed  by  management,  repurchases  of  voting  securities  and  other  corporatedefensive
 tactics that affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may beinjurious
 to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverseeffects
 of  these  business  practices  upon  Mississippi’s  gaming  industry  and  to  further  Mississippi’s  policy  to  assure  the  financial  stability  of  corporate  gamingoperators
 and  their  affiliates,  preserve  the  beneficial  aspects  of  conducting  business  in  the  corporate  form,  and  promote  a  neutral  environment  for  the  orderlygovernance of corporate 
affairs. 
We may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission bef
ore we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excessof the current market price of
 its common stock (commonly called “greenmail”) or before we may consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by management. Theregulations
 also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission if we adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by our Board of Directors opposing atender offer made di
rectly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of us. 
Prior
 approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission must be obtained before we, the casino licensees and/or persons found suitable to be associated withthe
 gaming license of the casino licensees conduct gaming operations outside of the United States. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may require that it haveaccess
 to information concerning our, and our affiliates’, foreign gaming operations. We believe that we have applied for all necessary waivers of foreign gamingapproval from the Mississipp
i Gaming Commission for the conduct of our active or planned gaming operations outside of the United States. 
If
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that the casino licensees violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission couldlimit,
 condition, suspend or revoke the license of the subsidiary. In addition, we, the casino licensees and the persons involved could be subject to substantial finesfor
 each separate violation. A violation under any of our other operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of the casino licensees’ gaminglicense.
 
Because of
 a violation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities. Limitation, conditioning orsuspension
 of  the  casino  licensees’  gaming  license  or  our  registration  as  a  publicly  traded  holding  company,  or  the  appointment  of  a  supervisor  could,  and  therevocation of any gaming l
icense or registration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations. 
The
 casino licensees must pay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and tothe
 county or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payableeither monthly, quarte
rly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and the numberof table games operat
ed by the casino. 
The
 license  fee  payable  to the State  of Mississippi  is based upon “gross revenues,”  generally  defined  as cash receipts  less cash payouts to customers  aswinnings,
 and generally equals 8% of gross revenue. These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid. Thegross
 revenue fee imposed by the Mississippi cities and counties in which casino operations are located is in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippiand equals approximately 4
% of gross revenue. 
The Mississippi Gaming Commis
sion adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s planinclude
 a  500-car  parking  facility  in  close  proximity  to  the  casino  complex  and  infrastructure  facilities  which  will  amount  to  at  least  25%  of  the  casino  cost.Infrastructure facilities are defined i
n the regulation to include a hotel with at 
10

 least
 250 rooms, theme park, golf course and other similar facilities. Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in compliance with this requirement. On January 21,1999,
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted an amendment to this regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%;however,
 the  regulation  grandfathers  existing  licensees  and  applies  only  to  new  casino  projects  and  casinos  that  are  not  operating  at  the  time  of  acquisition  orpurchase,
 and  would  therefore  not  apply  to  Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica.  In  any  event,  Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica  would  comply  with  suchrequirement.
 On February 21, 2013, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted further amendments to this regulation to impose additional requirements on newcasino
 projects. However, the amended regulation grandfathers any licensee who has been licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission prior to December 31,2013; therefore, the am
endments do not apply to Beau Rivage or Gold Strike Tunica. 
Both
 the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi Department of Revenue license, control and regulate the sale ofalcoholic beverages by
 the casino licensees. Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in areas designated as special resort areas, which allows casinos located thereinto
 serve alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour basis. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that our key officers and managers and the casino licensees’ keyofficers
 and managers and all owners of more than 5% of the casino licensees’ equity submit detailed personal, and in some instances, financial information to theAlcoholic
 Beverage Control Division and be investigated and licensed. All such licenses are non-transferable. The Alcohol Beverage Control Division has the fullpower
 to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions. Anydisciplinary action cou
ld, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations.

 Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020. Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, all casino operations andrelated
 equipment in MGM Macau will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise and MGM ResortsInternational
 will cease to generate any revenues from these operations. Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession bygiving MGM Grand Paradise at least on
e year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity. 
The amount of such compensation o
r indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption. 
The
 Macau government also has the right to unilaterally terminate, without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, the subconcession at any time upon theoccurrence
 of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  thesubconcession
 contract. If the default is curable, the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though nospecific cure period 
for that purpose is provided. 
The
 subconcession contract contains various general covenants and obligations and other provisions, the compliance with which is subjective. MGM GrandParadise has the following oblig
ations under the subconcession contract: 
 
• ensure the proper operat ion and conduct of casino games; 
 
• employ people with appropria te qualifications; 
 
• operate and conduct casino g ames of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities; and 
 
• safeguard and ensure Macau ’s interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas. 
The subconcession contract r
equires MGM Grand Paradise Limited to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance which are in place. 
MGM Grand Paradise Limited is also sub
ject to certain reporting requirements to the Macau gaming authorities. 
 
12

 Under
 the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Limited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R. an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variableportion
 based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated. The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 mil lion patacas (approximately
 $3.83  million,  based on exchange rates at December   31 , 201 8 ). The variable  portion  is equal  to 300,000 patacas  per gaming table  reservedexclusively
 for certain kinds of games or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine,including
 slot machines (approximately $ 38,304 ,  $ 19,152 and  $12 8 , respectively, based on exchange rates at December  31 , 201 8 ), subject to a minimum offorty five million pa
tacas (approximately $5. 75  million, based on exchange rates at December  31 , 201 8 ). MGM Grand Paradise Limited also has to pay a specialgaming
 tax  of  35%  of  gross  gaming  revenues  and  applicable  withholding  taxes.  It  must  also  contribute  1.6%  and  2.4%  (a  portion  of  which  must  be  used  forpromotion
 of  tourism  in  Macau)  of  its  gross  gaming  revenue  to  a  public  foundation  designated  by  the  Macau  S.A.R.  government  and  to  the  Macau  S.A.R,respectively, as speci
al levy. 
Currently,
 the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions forcredit
 losses. As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has topay taxes on its winnings from thes
e customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use a 10.67 acre parcel of land for MGM Macau (the “MGM Macau LandContract”). The land concess
ion will expire on April 6, 2031 and is renewable. 
The
 MGM Macau Land Contract requires MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Macau. In addition,MGM Grand Paradise
 is also obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Macau Land Contract. The rent amount may be revised every five years by theMacau government, accord
ing to the provisions of the Macau Land law. 
In addition,
 MGM Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use an approximately 18 acre site in Cotai Macau and develop asecond resort and casino (th
e “MGM Cotai Land Contract”). The land concession will expir e on January 8, 2038 and is renewable. 
The
 MGM Cotai Land Contract requires MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium, which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Cotai. In addition,MGM
 Grand Paradise is also obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Cotai Land Contract. The rent amount may be revised every five years by theMacau government, accord
ing to the provisions of the Macau Land law. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise received an exemption from Macau’s corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for aperiod of
 five-years starting at January 1, 2007. In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years. Theexemption was further ext
ended on September 7, 2016 through March 31, 2020.
Maryland
Government
Regulation
 
The
 Maryland State Lottery Video Lottery Terminal Law (“Maryland VLT Law”) subjects the owners and operators of video lottery facilities to extensivestate
 licensing  and  regulatory  requirements.  We  are  subject  to  the  Maryland  VLT Law  and  the  regulations  promulgated  to  implement  it  through  our  ownershipinterest in MGM National Harbor, LLC, which op
erates the MGM National Harbor video lottery facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland. 
Under the Maryland VLT Law, the Maryland Lo
ttery and Gaming Control Commission (“Maryland Commission”), in conjunction with the Maryland Lotteryand
 Gaming Control Agency (“Maryland Agency”), maintains authority to regulate the operation of video lottery terminals and tables games within the State ofMaryland,
 and to issue video lottery operation licenses to qualified applicants. The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission (“Maryland LocationCommission”)
 has  the  authority  to  award  up  to  six  video  lottery  operation  licenses  within  the  State  of  Maryland  and  is  responsible  for  evaluating  competingproposals
 and awarding the video lottery  operation  licenses  to applicants  based on business and market,  economic  development  and location  siting  factors.  TheMaryland
 Location  Commission  cannot  award  a  video  lottery  operation  license  to  an  applicant  until  the  Maryland  Commission  determines  that  the  applicant  isqualified.
 On  October  10,  2013,  the  Maryland  Commission  determined  that  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  and  all  applicable  principals  were  qualified,  and  onDecember
 23,  2013,  the  Maryland  Location  Commission  awarded  the  video  lottery  operation  license  in  Prince  George’s  County,  Maryland  to  MGM  NationalHarbor,
 LLC.  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  was  awarded  the  sixth  and  final  video  lottery  operation  license  in  Maryland.  On  December  7,  2016,  the  MarylandCommission issued a video lotte
ry operation license to MGM National Harbor, LLC, which license has an initial term of 15 years. 
 
13

 The
 initial license fee was based on the number of video lottery terminals initially proposed within the video lottery facility. As 3,600 video lottery terminalswere
 proposed for MGM National Harbor, our initial license fee was $21 million, and the Maryland Location Commission determined that MGM National Harbormay
 have up to 3,600 terminals. Within 1 year of the end of the initial 15–year license term, a video lottery operation licensee may reapply for a license that has alicense term of 10 yea
rs and a license fee to be established by statute. 
At the request of the Company, on August 17, 2016, the M
aryland Commission temporarily reduced the number of permitted video lottery terminals to 3,321,which temporary reduction was to become permanent
 if there were not 3,600 terminals in operation at MGM National Harbor by December 8, 2017. However, at therequest
 of the Company, on June 29, 2017, the Maryland Commission approved a further temporary reduction to not less than 2,700 terminals in connection with acasino
 expansion project while preserving the Company’s originally authorized allotment of 3,600 terminals until December 8, 2018. Subsequently, at the request ofthe
 Company, on November 15, 2018, the Maryland Commission approved a continued temporary reduction of not less than 3,130 terminals while preserving theCompany’s
 originally authorized allotment of 3,600 terminals until December 8, 2019.The Maryland Commission further determined that as of December 8, 2019the
 authorized  number  of  terminals  shall  be  not  less  than  3,130  or  more  than  3,600,  with  the  final  authorized  number  of  terminals  being  the  actual  number  ofterminals in operat
ion at MGM National Harbor as of December 8, 2019.Under
 the Maryland VLT Law, video lottery terminals each must have an average payout percentage of at least 87%.Video lottery facilities are permitted tooperate 24 hours
 a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager. While alcohol may be offered in the video lottery facility, it may not be offered free of charge.The
 Maryland VLT Law and regulations also impose various restrictions on check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions within thevideo lottery facility.
 
The
 Maryland Commission has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for a video lottery operationlicense,
 affiliated holding or intermediary companies, directors, officers, key management employees, principals, partners, and other persons or entities holding afive percent or grea
ter interest in the applicant, are qualified under the Maryland VLT Law. 
The
 Maryland  VLT  Law  provides  that  institutional  investors  may  be  exempt  from  certain  regulatory  requirements,  and  an  Institutional  Investor  WaiverApplication
 may be submitted for entities holding an interest in an applicant or licensee that are considered institutional investors. The term “institutional investor”generally includes insur
ance companies, banks and financial institutions, investment companies, trusts and advisors, pension funds, etc. The Maryland Commission’sdecision
 concerning  whether  to grant  a waiver  is  discretionary,  and based on a  variety  of factors  that  include,  but are  not limited  to,  the institutional  investor’ssecurities,
 whether  the  investor  is  substantially  involved  in  the  video  lottery  operations  of  the  licensee,  and  the  investor’s  gaming  licensure  history  in  otherjurisdictions.
 
After
 a video lottery operation license is awarded and/or issued, the Maryland Commission has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing ofthe
 licensee and its officers, directors, and other designated persons. The Maryland Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or restrict a video lotteryoperation license, and may levy
 civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. The licensee’s participation in video lottery and table game operations is expresslydeemed a revocable privilege under the Maryland VLT Law, conditione
d on the proper and continued qualification of the licensee and the licensee meeting reportingrequirements
 and  continuing  to  provide  any  assistance  and  information  necessary  to  the  Maryland  regulators.  Each  licensee  has  an  affirmative  responsibility  toprovide
 an annual update of applicable licensing information to the Maryland Commission. Among other things, the Maryland Commission is also responsible forthe collection of
 application, license and other fees, conducting investigations into the operation of video lottery terminals and table games, and reviewing and rulingon complaints, and may conduct un
announced inspections of the video lottery facility premises or the licensee’s records and equipment. 
The regulations promulgated to implement the Maryland VLT Law impose detailed substantive and proced
ural requirements related to video lottery licensingand
 ongoing  operations.  The  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  provisions  concerning:  licensing  investigations  and  hearings;  marketing  controls  andstandards;
 internal control standards related to accounting, finance and statistics, audits, record retention, complimentaries, surveillance, security, cage and customertransactions,
 promotions, and other gaming related controls; facility design standards; table games surveillance; gaming floor plans; the transportation and testing ofvideo
 lottery  terminals  and  table  games  equipment;  the  registration  of  video  lottery  terminals  and  table  games;  voluntary  and  mandatory  patron  exclusion;responsible
 gaming; and junket enterprises and representatives. Applicants and licensees must also meet requirements concerning minority business participation,provide health insurance
 and retirement benefits for employees, and give preference to hiring employees located within ten miles of the video lottery facility. 
Generally,
 a  video  lottery  operation  license  may  not  be  transferred,  assigned  or  pledged  as  collateral  without  approval  from  the  Maryland  Commission.Specifically,
 a licensee  cannot sell or transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial  interests  in the licensee unless the Maryland Commission is notified  anddetermines that the buyer 
or transferee meets all applicable qualification and 
14

 regulatory
 requirements. If the licensee fails to meet these requirements, the applicable license will be automatically revoked ninety days after the transfer or sale.Entities
 and  individuals  are  also  prohibited  from  owning  an  interest  in  more  than  one  video  lottery  facility,  and  any  application  to  the  Maryland  LocationCommission to
 apply for an additional license must include a plan for divesting the applicable interest in the initial license. Applicants seeking investors in an entityapplying
 for  a video  lottery  operation  license  must  make  serious,  good-faith  efforts  to solicit  and interview  a reasonable  number  of  minority  investors  before  alicense will be awarded by the Maryland Location Commission, an
d following the award, must again make serious, good-faith efforts to interview minority investorsin any future attempts to
 raise venture capital or attract new investors to the entity awarded the license. 
The
 Maryland  Commission  retains  the  authority  to  recommend  or  propose  changes  to  the  Maryland  VLT  Law,  and  may  amend  or  change  regulationsconcerning the Maryland VLT Law, which, i
f enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Maryland.
New
Jersey
Government
Regulation
 
Our ownership
 of Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey subjects us to extensive state regulation under the New Jersey Casino Control Act and the regulationspromulgated thereunder (collectively, the “NJ Act”) and various other statutes and regulations
. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (“NJ Commission”) andthe
 New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (“NJ Division” and, together with the NJ Commission, the “NJ Gaming Authorities”) are, to varying degrees,empowered
 to regulate a wide spectrum of gaming and non-gaming related activities and to approve the form of ownership and financial structure of not only acasino licensee, but also 
its holding and intermediary companies and entity qualifiers. 
The
 NJ Commission issues casino licenses and casino key employee licenses and the NJ Division issues all other types of licenses, including permits toconduct
 intrastate Internet gaming, approvals to conduct sports wagering pools, and registrations and licenses to persons who provide goods or services to a casino.The NJ Division also is responsible for 
investigating all license applications and for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the requirements of the NJ Act. 
On
 June 24, 2010, the NJ Commission renewed Borgata’s casino license effective July 1, 2010 for a term which became indefinite by operation of law.However,
 no later than five years after the issuance of a casino license, and approximately every five years thereafter, the casino licensee and its qualifying entitiesand individuals must submit information to the NJ Gaming Aut
horities to demonstrate their continuing qualification. In addition, the NJ Commission may reopen thelicense
 hearing at any time, and the NJ Commission must do so at the request of the NJ Division. In September 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries were foundqualified as holding compan
ies of Borgata. 
Pursuant to
 the NJ Act and applicable precedent, no entity may hold a casino license unless each officer, director, person who directly or indirectly holds anybeneficial interest
 or ownership of the securities of the licensee, each person who in the opinion of the Director of the NJ Division has the ability to control or elect amajority
 of the board of directors of the licensee (other than a banking or other licensed lending institution acting in the ordinary course of business) and each of itsholding, intermediary or subs
idiary companies, obtains and maintains qualification approval from the NJ Gaming Authorities. 
Persons
 holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding or intermediary company are presumed to have the ability to control the company or electone
 or more of its directors and will, unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or the qualification requirement is waived, be required toindividually qualify.
 Equity securities are defined in the NJ Act as any voting stock or any other security having a direct or indirect participation in the profits of theissuer.
 Notwithstanding either the presumption of control for holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding company or the requirement that a casinolicensee
 establish and maintain the qualification of certain holders of debt securities, the NJ Act provides for a waiver of qualification for passive “institutionalinvestors,” as defined by the NJ Act und
er certain circumstances. 
Casino
 licensees  are  also  required  to  establish  and  maintain  the  qualifications  of  any  financial  backer,  investor,  mortgagee,  bondholder,  or  holder  ofindentures, notes
 or other evidences of indebtedness, either in effect or proposed which bears any relation to the casino operation or casino hotel premises who holds25%
 or  more  of  such  financial  instruments  or  other  evidences  of  indebtedness;  provided,  however,  in  circumstances  of  default,  persons  holding  10%  of  suchfinancial
 instruments or evidences of indebtedness shall be required to establish and maintain their qualifications. Persons who hold less than these thresholds maybe
 required to establish and maintain their qualifications in the discretion of the Director of the NJ Division. Banks and licensed lending institutions, however, areexempt from any qualif
ication requirements if they are acting in the ordinary course of business. 
The
 NJ  Act  imposes  certain  restrictions  upon  the  issuance,  ownership  and  transfer  of  securities  of  a  casino  licensee  and  its  holding  and  intermediarycompanies
 and  defines  the  term  “security”  to  include  instruments  which  evidence  a  direct  or  indirect  beneficial  ownership  or  creditor  interest,  including  stock(common
 and preferred) mortgages, debentures, security agreements, notes, warrants, options and rights. If the NJ Commission finds that a holder of such securitiesis not qualified under the NJ Act, 
it has the 
15

 right
 to take any remedial action deemed appropriate including the right to force divestiture by such disqualified holder of such securities . In the event that certaindisqualified
 holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, the NJ Commission has the power  to revoke or suspend the casino license or licenses related to thecompany
 which issued the securities . It is unlawful for a disqualified holder (i) to exercise, directly or through any trustee or nominee, any right conferred by suchsecurities or (ii)
 to receive any dividends or interest upon such securities or any remuneration, in any form, from its affiliated casino licensee for services rendered orotherwise.
 
The
 NJ Act requires our certificate of incorporation to provide that our securities are held subject to the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualifiedby
 the NJ Commission pursuant to the NJ Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in the company. Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that aholder
 of our securities must dispose of such securities if the holder is found disqualified under the NJ Act. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides thatwe may redeem the stock of 
any holder found to be disqualified. 
The
 ability  of  a  lender  to  foreclose  on  pledged  assets,  including  gaming  equipment,  is  subject  to  compliance  with  the  NJ  Act.  Generally,  no  person  ispermitted
 to hold an ownership interest in or manage a casino or own any gaming assets, including gaming devices, without being licensed. Consequently, anylender
 who  desires  to  enforce  a  security  interest  must  file  the  necessary  applications  for  licensure,  be  investigated,  and  either  be  found  qualified  by  the  NJCommission
 or obtain interim casino authorization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest. Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interestin
 a casino or of gaming assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain ICAprior to obtaining any ownership in
terest or gaming assets.
Massachusetts
Government
Regulation
 
The Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act 
(“Massachusetts Act”) subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensing andregulatory
 requirements. We are subject to the Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest in Blue TarpreDevelopment, LLC (“Blue Tarp”
), which operates a gaming establishment in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
Under
 the  Massachusetts  Act,  the  Massachusetts  Gaming  Commission  (“Massachusetts  Commission”)  is  responsible  for  issuing  licenses  under  theMassachusetts
 Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons. The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau(“IEB”),
 which is a Bureau within the Massachusetts Commission, is responsible for conducting administrative investigations of applicants and licensees, and forgenerally enforcing the Massachusetts Act
 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to enforce the law, the IEB coordinates with the Massachusetts StatePolice,
 Attorney  General  and  the  Alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Commission.  The  Massachusetts  Act  also  establishes  a  Gaming  Enforcement  Division  within  theMassachusetts Attorney Genera
l’s Office responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of the Massachusetts Act. The Massachusetts Commissionhas
 the  authority  to  award  up  to  three  Category  1  licenses  (table  games  and  slot  machines),  and  one  Category  2  license  (slot  machines  only),  within  theCommonwealth of Massachusetts to qu
alified applicants. 
On December
 23, 2013, the Massachusetts Commission determined that Blue Tarp and all applicable principal individuals and entities were qualified, and onNovember 6, 2014, the Massachusetts Comm
ission awarded the sole Category 1 license in Region B of Massachusetts to Blue Tarp, effective November 7, 2014. 
Blue Tarp
 received its operations certificate issued by the Massachusetts Commission on September 13, 2018. That operations certificate is conditioned uponBlue Tarp continuing to meet 
applicable licensing, registration, qualification and other regulatory requirements. 
The
 initial license term is 15 years, which commenced upon the Massachusetts Commission’s approval of the commencement of the operation of the gamingestablishment on August
 23, 2018. The initial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85,000,000, as determined by the Massachusetts Commission and authorized bythe
 Massachusetts Act, which amount Blue Tarp has paid. All Category 1 and Category 2 gaming licensees are also subject to additional annual fees under theMassachusetts
 Act. Category 1 licensees must generally make on-going annual capital expenditures to their gaming establishments in a minimum aggregate amountequal to 3.5 percent of the n
et gaming revenues derived from the establishment. 
Under
 the Massachusetts Act, gaming establishments may be open 24 hours a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager. Gaming beverage licensesmay
 be granted by the Massachusetts Commission for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages at the gaming establishment except (i) between the hours of 2a.m.
  and 8 a.m. outside of the gaming area and (ii) between the hours of 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. within the gaming area. The Massachusetts Act and regulations alsodescribe procedures for, 
and restrictions on, check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions within the gaming establishment.   
 
16

 The
 Massachusetts Commission, in particular the IEB, has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants forCategory
 1 and Category 2 licenses, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, financiers and debt holders, associates,key gaming executives and e
mployees, other gaming related employees, and other persons or entities holding a five percent or greater direct or indirect interest in theapplicant, are quali
fied under the Massachusetts Act (with certain exemptions for institutional investors in the discretion of the Massachusetts Commission) .  
After
 a Category 1 license is awarded, the Massachusetts Commission and IEB have responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licenseeand
 its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons. The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category1 license,
 or any other license issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. All licenses issued underthe
 Massachusetts  Act  are  expressly  deemed  a  revocable  privilege,  conditioned  on  the  licensee’s  fulfillment  of  all  conditions  of  licensure,  compliance  withapplicable
 laws and regulations, and the licensee’s continuing qualification and suitability. Among other things, the Massachusetts Commission is also responsiblefor
 the  collection  of  application,  license  and  other  fees,  conducting  investigations  of  and  monitoring  applicants  and  licensees,  and  reviewing  and  ruling  oncomplaints, and may conduct 
inspections of the gaming establishment premises or the licensee’s records and equipment. 
The
 regulations promulgated to implement the Massachusetts Act impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to licensing and on-goingoperations.
 The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing and registration of employees and vendors; accounting procedures andinternal
 controls;  surveillance  and  security  requirements;  gaming  equipment,  devices  and  systems,  and  device  registration  and  testing;  self-exclusion;  on-goingreporting
 requirements related to construction, approvals and operations; temporary licensure; marketing and affirmative marketing plans; notification requirementsrelated
 to new or changes in shareholders, executives, and other qualifiers; notification and/or approval of certain material events and transactions; complimentaryservices;
 on-going capital expenditures; political contributions; credit issuance and customer transactions; auditing and record retention; facility design and gamingfloor
 plans;  slot  machine  possession  and  transportation;  table  game  rules  and  procedures;  employee  credentials;  vendors  and  junkets;  and  count  room  and  cageprocedures.
 
Generally,
 interests in a gaming establishment  and Category 1 licenses may not be transferred  without notification  to and approval of the MassachusettsCommission. The
 sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of any security issued by a corporation which holds a gaming license is conditional and willbe ineffective if disapproved by the Massachusetts Commission
. Category 1 licensees may also not change their business governing structure without the notificationand
 approval  of  the  Massachusetts  Commission,  and  may  not  operate,  invest  in  or  own,  in  whole  or  in  part,  another  gaming  licensee’s  license  or  gamingestablishment.
 
The
 Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to promulgate, amend or repeal regulations concerning the Massachusetts Act, which, if enacted, couldadversely
 affect  the  gaming  industry  and  our  ability  to  operate  in  Massachusetts.  Further,  certain  regulations  are  currently  in  draft  form,  and  subject  to  furtherreview, revision and final 
approval.

AUDITORS’
REPORT 
To the Board of Directors
CityCenter Holdings, LLC
 
We
 have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  CityCenter  Holdings,  LLC  and  its  subsidiaries  (the  “Company”),  which  comprise  theconsolidated
 balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members’ equity, and cash flows for each ofthe three years in the p
eriod ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
Management’s
Responsibility
for
the
Consolidated
Financial
Stat
ements 
Management
 is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generallyaccepted
 in  the  United  States  of  America;  this  includes  the  design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  fairpresentation of consoli
dated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditors’
Responsibility
 
Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditingstandards
 generally  accepted  in  the United  States  of  America.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  aboutwhether the consolidate
d financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
An
 audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  proceduresselected
 depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due tofraud
 or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  Company’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  theconsolidated
 financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion onthe
 effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accountingpolicies
 used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidatedfinancial statements.
 
We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion
 
In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CityCenter Holdings, LLC andits
 subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  2018  and  2017,  and  the  results  of  their  operations  and  their  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  endedDecember 31, 2018, in accordanc
e with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

BASIS
OF

PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 
Basis

of
presentation.
The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries.  The  Company  does  not  have  avariable
 interest in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations are notnecessarily indicat
ive of the results to be expected in the future. 
Management’s

use
of
estimates.
The  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted inthe United States of America. Those principles require the Company’
s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities
 and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during thereporting period. Actual r
esults could differ from those estimates. 
Fair
value
measurements.
Fair value measurements  affect the Company’s accounting for and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets and intangibleassets.
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe
 measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which areobservable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, w
hich are unobservable inputs. The Company used Level 2 inputs when measuring the fair value of its interestrate
 swaps. The interest rate swap values are recorded as a net unrealized gain or loss position and recognized as an asset or liability within “Other assets” or “Otherlong-term obligations.” Se
e Note 7. 
5

Exhibit
99.3 
Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
Cash and  cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of ninety days or less at the dateof acquisition. Such investmen
ts are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 
Accounts

receivable
and
credit
risk.
The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2018, approximately 53% of the Company’s casino receivables were due from customers from foreign countries. Enforceability issues, business oreconomic conditions or othe
r significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables. 
Trade
 receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off whenmanagement deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously 
written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful accounts ismaintained to
 reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated realizable amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on a specificreview of customer accounts
 as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31,2018, no significant concentr
ations of credit risk existed. 
Inventories.
Inventories consist primarily of food  and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costis determined prima
rily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method. 
Residential

real
estate.
Residential  real  estate  represented  capitalized  costs  of  residential  inventory,  which  consisted  of  completed  condominium  unitsavailable for sale less impairments previously recognized. Costs included land
, direct and indirect construction and development costs, and capitalized property taxesand interest. The last r
esidential units were sold in 2016. 
Property
and
equipment.
Property and equipment are  stated at cost including capitalized interest. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipmentare
 included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its lifeare
 charged to expense as incurred. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had accrued $2.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for property andequipment within accounts pay
able, and $0.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, related to construction retention within accounts payable. 
Property and equipment are d
epreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
 20 to 40 years Land improvements
 10 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures
 3 to 20 years Equipment
 3 to 15 years  
Project
 costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts tothe
 extent such property or equipment is contributed by MGM Resorts) unless determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimatedfair value.
 
In
 December 2015, the Company decided to close the Zarkana show at the Aria Resort & Casino as part of a plan to expand its conference and conventionspace. As a result, the Company shortened the usef
ul lives of the assets related to the Zarkana theatre and recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $82 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2016.
 The fully depreciated assets related to the Zarkana theatre were disposed in April 2016 and construction of the conferenceand expansion space began in May 2016, which op
ened during the first quarter of 2018. 
Capitalized

interest.
  The  interest  costs  associated  with  development  and  construction  projects  are  capitalized  and  included  in  the  cost  of  the  project.Capitalization of int
erest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
Impairment

of
long-lived
assets.
The  Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to beheld and used for impairment whenever indicators of
 impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to thecarrying amount
 of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed thecarrying
 amount,  then  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset,  typically  measured  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  model.  Any  recognizedimpairment losses would be r
ecorded as operating expense. 
6

Exhibit
99.3 
Other
assets.
The  Company’s other assets include intangible assets, deposits, base stock, and other assets. Indefinite-lived intangible  assets are reviewed forimpairment at least annually an
d between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibleassets in the fourth 
quarter of each fiscal year . No impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review. 
Debt
issuance
costs
. The  Company capitalizes debt issuance costs, which include legal and other direct costs related to the issuance of debt. The capitalizedcosts are amortized straight-line
 to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt.
Revenue

recognition.
The  Company’s  revenue  contracts  with  customers  consist  of  casino  wager  transactions,  hotel  room  sales,  food  and  beveragetransactions, entert
ainment shows, and retail transactions. 
The
 transaction  price  for  a  casino  wager  is  the  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses  (“net  win”).  In  certain  circumstances,  the  Company  offersdiscounts
 on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casinorevenue on a portfolio basis g
iven the similar characteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis. 
For
 casino  wager  transactions  that  include  other  goods  and  services  provided  by  the  Company  to  gaming  patrons  on  a  discretionary  basis  to  incentivizegaming,
 the  Company  allocates  revenue  from  the  casino  wager  transaction  to  the  good  or  service  delivered  based  upon  stand-alone  selling  price  (“SSP”).Discretionary goods and servic
es provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense. 
For casino
 wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty program, the Company allocates a portion of net winbased
 upon the SSP of such incentive (less estimated breakage). This allocation is deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer redeems the incentive.When
 redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third party outlets are deductedfrom
 the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. Commissions and incentives providedto
 gaming customers were collectively $212 million, $190 million and $194 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Afterallocating revenue to o
ther goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue. 
The
 transaction  price  of  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  retail  contracts  is  the  net  amount  collected  from  the  customer  for  such  goods  and  services. The transaction
 price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery ismade
 for the food and beverage and retail and other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company actsas
 an agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services, which primarily include certain of the Company’s entertainment shows as well ascustomer rooms arranged by on
line travel agents. 
The
 Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings withhotel
 stays  and  convention  services.  For  such  arrangements,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  to  each  good  or  service  based  on  its  relative  SSP.  The  Companyprimarily
 determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when soldseparately in similar circumstances
 to similar customers. 
Contract
and

Contract-Related
Liabilities.
There  may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue,resulting
 in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chipliability,
 which represents the amounts owned in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer,  (2) loyalty program obligations,  which represents  the deferredallocation
 of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited bycustomers
 before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided such as advance ticket  sales anddeposits
 on  rooms  and  convention  space  or  for  unpaid  wagers.  These  liabilities  are  generally  expected  to  be  recognized  as  revenue  within  one  year  of  beingpurchased, earned, or deposit
ed and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Revenue

by
source.
The  Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, rooms, food and beverage,and
 entertainment, retail, residential and other). Lease revenues earned by the Company from third-parties are classified within the line item corresponding to thetype
 or nature of the tenant’s good or service. Lease revenues include $3 million, $3 million and $4 million recorded within food and beverage revenue for the yearsended
 December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016,  respectively,  and  $3  million,  $2  million  and  $3  million  recorded  within  entertainment,  retail,  residential  and  otherrevenue for the same such p
eriods, respectively. 
Real

estate
sales.
Revenue  for residential sales is deferred until closing occurs, which is when title, possession and other attributes of ownership have beentransferred
 to the buyer and the Company is not obligated to perform activities after the sale. Additionally, the buyer’s initial and continuing investment must beadequate to demonstrat
e a commitment to pay and the buyer’s receivable cannot be subject to future subordination.
Residential
 operating expenses include cost of real estate  sold, holding costs, selling costs, indirect selling costs and valuation  allowances for residentialmortgage
 notes receivable. Costs associated with residential sales were deferred during construction, except for indirect selling costs and general and administrativeexpense, which were expensed as incu
rred. 
Advertising.
The  Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is included in preopening and start-upexpenses when related
 to the preopening and start-up period and in general and administrative expense when related to ongoing operations. Advertising expense was$15 million, $14 million and $15 m
illion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Property

transactions,
net.
The  Company classifies transactions related to long-lived assets – such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, andgains and losses on the sale of f
ixed assets – within “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
Income

taxes.
The  Company  is  treated  as  a  partnership  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  Therefore,  federal  income  taxes  are  the  responsibility  of  theMembers. As a result, no provision fo
r income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Comprehensive
income
(loss).
Net income (loss) equals co mprehensive income (loss) for all years presented. 
Reclassification

of
prior
year
balances.
Reclassifications  were made to the prior-period consolidated financial statements to conform to the current periodpresentation.

 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”) which outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting forrevenue
 arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under the standard,revenue
 is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive inexchange for those goods and servi
ces. 
The
 Company adopted ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. The most significant impacts of the adoption of the new accountingpronouncement are as fol
lows:

Exhibit
99.3 
 
• Promotional  Allowances. The  Company  no  longer  recognizes  revenues  for  goods  and  services  provided  to  customers  for  free  as  an  inducement  togamble
 as gross revenue with a corresponding offset to promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues, and accordingly the promotional allowancesline
 item has been removed. The majority of such amounts previously included in promotional allowances now offset casino revenues based on anallocation of revenues 
to performance obligations using SSP . This change resulted in a r eclassification of revenue between revenue line items; 
 
• Loyalty  Accounting. As discussed within Revenue
Recognition
 above,  the outstanding performance obligations of the loyalty program liability are nowrecognized
 at retail value of such benefits owed to the customer (less estimated breakage). This change resulted in a decrease to retained earnings as ofJanuary
 1, 2016 of $4 million, with a corresponding increase primarily to “Due to MGM Resorts International,” as a result of the initial application ofthe standard and did not have a s
ignificant impact to other balance sheet accounts or earnings; 
 
• Gross  versus Net Presentation. Mandatory service charges on food and beverage and wide area progressive operator fees are recorded gross, that is, theamount
 received  from  the  customer  will  be  recorded  as  revenue  with  the  corresponding  amount  paid  as  an  expense.  These  changes  resulted  in  anincrease in revenue with 
a corresponding increase in expense; and 
 
• Estimated  Cost of Promotional Allowances. The Company no longer reclassifies the estimated cost of complimentaries provided to the gaming patronfrom other expense line item
s to the casino expense line item. This change resulted in a reclassification between expense line items. 
These
 changes, and other less significant adjustments that were required upon adoption, did not have an aggregate material impact on net income or cashflows. The following table shows the inc
rease/(decrease) to the Company’s 2017 and 2016 income statement line items as follows:

In
 February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842, “Leases (Topic 842),” which replaces the existing guidance in Topic 840, “Leases,” (“ASC 842”). ASC 842 iseffective
 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASC 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting underwhich
 a  lessee  would  classify  and  account  for  its  lease  agreements  as  either  finance  or  operating.  Both  finance  and  operating  leases  will  result  in  the  lesseerecognizing
 a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee will recognize interest expense associated with the leaseliability
 and depreciation expense associated with the ROU asset, and for operating leases, the lessee will recognize straight-line rent expense. The Company willadopt ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 utilizi
ng the simplified transition method and accordingly will not recast comparative period financial information. The Companywill
 elect the basket of transition practical expedients which includes not needing to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2)the
 lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) direct costs for any existing leases. The Company also currently expects that the most significantimpact will be the re
cognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases that exist at the Company on the date of adoption. 
In
 January  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  No.  2016-15,  “Statement  of  Cash  Flows  (Topic  230):  Classification  ofCertain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
(a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force),” (“ASU 2016-15”).9

Exhibit

ASU
 2016-15 amends the guidance of ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose ofASU
 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles, specifically clarifying the guidance on eight cash flowissues. The adoption of 2016-15 did not have 
a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Senior

credit
facility.
At  December 31, 2018, the senior credit facility consisted of $1.8 billion of term loans and a $125 million revolving credit facility.The
 term  loan B facility  will  mature  in April  2024 and  the revolving  credit  facility  will  mature  in  April 2022.   In May  2018, the  Company amended  its creditagreement
 to provide for a $200 million increase in the term loan B facility and repriced its term loan B interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.25% with a LIBOR floor of0.75%.  Additionally, the term loan
 B facility is subject to quarterly amortization payments of approximately $5 million beginning in June 2018 through March 2024with
 the remaining balance due in April 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company permanently repaid $14 million in accordance with thescheduled
 amortization payments. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rate on the term loan B was 4.77%. Loans under the revolving facility bear interest atLIBOR plus 2.00%.
 As of December 31, 2018 the Company had not drawn on the revolving facility. The Company pays an applicable fee of 0.375%, for the unusedportion of
 the revolving facility. In connection with the amendment of the senior credit facility, the Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term debt of $0.7million, primarily 
consisting of the write-off of a portion of previously unamortized debt issuance costs. 
The
 senior credit facility is a general senior obligation of the Company and ranks equally with the Company’s other existing and future senior obligations, isfully
 and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the restricted  subsidiaries of the Company and is secured by a first-priority  perfected  lien onsubstantially all of th
e Company’s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. 
The
 senior credit facility contains customary positive, negative and financial covenants, including a requirement  that the Company maintains a quarterlyminimum
 interest  coverage  ratio  of  2.5:1.0  and  a  maximum  quarterly  leverage  ratio  for  the  trailing  four  quarters  of  5.00:1.00  for  December  31,  2018  andthereafter.  The Company was in 
compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2018. 
Pursuant to the senior credit facility, the Company is required to make permanent repayment
s of principal based on an annual calculation of excess cash flow,as defined
 in the agreements. The percentage of excess cash flow required to be repaid is based on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the end of the fiscal year, with50% required
 to be repaid if the leverage ratio is greater than 5.0:1.0 as of the measurement date, 25% if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0:1.0 and greaterthan 4.0:1.0, and
 no payment of excess cash flow is required if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.0:1.0. During 2018 and 2017 and as of December 31, 2018and 2017, the Company did not have excess c
ash flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior credit agreement for 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In
 order to manage interest rate risk inherent in its variable rate debt, the Company hedges the interest rate on the term loan under its senior credit facility.The
 Company entered into interest rate swap agreements effective December 31, 2018 with a notional value of $900 million and a maturity date of December 31,2023. The fixed rate paid is 2.73% 
and the variable rate received resets monthly to the greater of one-month LIBOR or 0.75%. 
As

NV

Energy.
In  July 2016, MGM Resorts, including the Company, filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and will purchaseenergy,
 capacity, and/or ancillary services from a provider other than NV Energy. In September 2016, the Company paid an upfront impact payment of $14 million,of which $2 million was billed to 
third party entities and represented a reduction in the overall impact fee expense. Of this $2 million receivable for amounts billed tothird
 party entities, $1 million is included in Accounts receivable, net as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Additionally, the Company is required to makeongoing
 payments to NV Energy for non-bypassable rate charges which primarily relate to its share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts whichextend
 through 2040 and each entity’s share of the costs of decommissioning and remediation of coal-fired power plants in Nevada. During 2017, the terms of theongoing
 impact  fee  obligations  were  modified.  Such  modifications  included  a  credit  to  be  applied  against  future  non-bypassable  rate  charges  and  substantiallyshortened the period over which MGM Resorts, including the Company, is responsible for
 such charges, with an end date in 2022. As such, the Company recognizeda
 reduction  in  its  liability  for  future  charges  of  $8  million  with  a  corresponding  credit  to  “NV  Energy  exit  expense.”  As of  December  31,  2018,  and  2017,  theCompany
 recorded an estimate of such liability on a discounted basis of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in “Due to MGM Resorts International” and $2million and $4 million, r
espectively, in “Other long-term obligations.”
Other

litigation.
The  Company  is  a  party  to  various  legal  proceedings  that  relate  to  construction  and  operational  matters  incidental  to  its  business.Management
 does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. TheCompany maintained an owner cont
rolled insurance program (OCIP) during the construction and development process. Under the OCIP, certain insurance coveragesmay cover a portion of the Comp
any’s general liability, workers compensation, and other potential liabilities.
