Company Overview
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. We are a leading global food and
beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay , Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana.

Our Operations
Changes to Organizational Structure
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned our Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Asia, Middle East and North Africa
(AMENA) reportable segments to be consistent with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our
Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. As a result, our beverage,
food and snack businesses in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia that were part of our former AMENA segment and our
businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa that were part of our former ESSA segment are now reported together as our Africa, Middle East
and South  Asia (AMESA) segment. The remaining beverage, food and snack businesses that were part of our former AMENA
segment are now reported together as our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC) segment and our
beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe are now reported as our Europe segment.
These changes did not impact our Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), Quaker Foods North America (QFNA),

Our Distribution Network
Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks
and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on
customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.
Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail
stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with
maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store
promotion and merchandising.
Customer W arehouse
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly
systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover .
Distributor Networks
We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater
distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice
and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party
foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
E-commerce
Our produ cts are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice
concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice,
seasonings, sucralos e, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our
key packaging materials include plasti c resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for
plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In
addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled
content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our
businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ
specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that
would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the
open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price
contracts and purcha se orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our
supply of certain raw materials is mitiga ted through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we
may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability
and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices
by our suppliers and expanding it further globally . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on
how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.

emphasize correct use of our trademark s. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks
in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks
on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain  of our products, their packaging, the processes for
their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to
others.
Seasonality
Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage, food and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due
to seasona l and holiday-related patterns , and generally lowest in the first quart er. However , taken as a whole, seasonality has not
had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.
Our Customers
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customer s, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent
bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage
products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our
independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for
product quality . We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks
for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incen tives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer . For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives inclu de volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated
annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs , such as consumer incentives, advertising support,
new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and
promotions, and other
6
Table of Contents
promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product
support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials,
product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipmen t placement programs support the acquisition and
placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually .
Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer
businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the growth in hard discounters, and the
current economic environment continue  to increase the importance of major customers. In 2019 , sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart)
and its affiliates, including Sam’ s Club (Sam’ s), represented approximately 13% of our consolidate d net revenue, with sales
reported across all of our divisions. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 34% of our 2019  net revenue in North
America, with Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) representing approximately 19%. These percentages include concentrate
sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.
See “Off-Balance-S heet Arrangements” in “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent
bottlers.
Our Competition
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private label manufacturers and econom y brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro
brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retail ers focused on locally-sourced products. In many
countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor .
Other beverage, food and snack comp etitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company , Conagra Brands, Inc.,
Kellogg Company , Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company , Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster
Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and Red Bull GmbH.
Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and
worldwide. In 2019 , we and The Coca- Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%, respectively , of the U.S. liquid
refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However ,
The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality ,
product variety , innovation, distributi on, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging,
convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased
consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and
purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective
introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective
incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our busines s, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns,
marketing programs, product packaging  and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development
and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and mark eting, coupled with the quality of our products and
flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete ef fectively .

(juices, lemonades, fruit and vegetable drinks), Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes), Naked Juice (cold-pressed juices and
smoothies), KeVita (probiotics, tonics and fermented teas), Bare (baked apple chips and other baked fruits and vegetables), Health
Warrior (nutrition bars), Evolve (plant-based protein products) and Muscle Milk (protein shakes); further expanding our whole
grain products globa lly; and further expanding our portfolio in growing categories, such as dairy , hummus and other refrigerated
dips, and baked grain snacks. In additio n, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including:
efforts to conserve raw materials and energy, such as by working to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across our
global businesses, by helping to protect and conserve global water supply especially in high-water -risk locations (including
replenishing watersheds that source our operations in high-water -risk locations and promoting the efficient use of water in our
agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating improvements in the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain
into our operations;  efforts to reduce waste generated by our operations and disposed of in landfills; efforts to increase energy
efficiency , including the increased use of renewable energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable agriculture by expanding
best practices with our growers and suppliers, including
8

through the use of data and technology to optimize yields and efficiency and promote responsible use of pesticides; and efforts to
create a circular future for packaging,  including the increased use of recycled content and alternative packaging, support for
increased packaging recovery and recycling rates globally , optimization of packaging technology and design to minimize the
amount of plastic in our packaging and to make our packaging increasingly recoverable or recyclable with lower environmental
impact, and our continued investments in developing compostable and biodegradable packaging.
Regulatory Matters
The conduct of our businesses, includ ing the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertising, marketing, labeling,
content, quality , safety , transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and
occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations
administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered
by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made,
manufactured, distri buted or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our
businesses.
The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws
governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local
environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the
Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state
laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity , such as the
Equal Emp loyment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the
Fair Labor Standards Act; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Privacy Act of
2018; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients
used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating our supply chain,
including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to
comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject
to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California,
which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having
been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.
We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and
regulations governi ng food safety , international trade and tariffs, supply chain, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act,
occupational health and safety , competition, anti-corruption and data privacy , including the European Union General Data
Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our
competitive position  in those jurisdictio ns, as is compliance with anti-corruptio n laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on
legal and operational compliance progra ms, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in
complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture,
distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the
production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages,
while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per
ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate
depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax
9
Table of Contents
rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or
other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such
products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that
highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances
present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or
encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from depo sit return systems designed to incentivize the return
of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and
other single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
We are also subject to national and local  environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business,
including laws related to water consum ption and treatment, wastewater dischar ge and air emissions. In the United States, our
facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liabil ity Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage,
release and disposal of wastes generat ed onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our
facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate
change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate
the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity
concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with
respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any
expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and
our subsidiaries are subject to enviro nmental remediation obligations arisin g in the normal course of business, as well as
remediation and related indemnificatio n obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations,
including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification
obligations cannot be predicted with certainty , such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Employees
As of December 28, 2019 , we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 267,000 people worldwide, including
approximately 116,000 people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal
variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargainin g agreements. We expect that we will be able to
renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.  We believe that relations with our
employees are generally good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form
10-K, including the Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and the
consolidated financi al statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the
future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition , results of operations or the price of our publicly
traded securities. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known
to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become mater ial in the future and adversely affect our business,
reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating
results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial
and business performance, events or trends.
Future demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to
innovate, market or distribute our products effectively , and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and
profits, we rely on continued demand for our products and therefore must understand our customers and consumers and sell
products that appeal to them in the sales  channel in which they prefer to shop or browse for such products. In general, changes in
consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics can result in reduced demand for our products. Demand for our
products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including
increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including products
that have less added sugars, sodium and saturated fat); convenience (including responding to changes in in-home and on-the-go
consumption patterns and methods of distribution of our products to customers and consumers, including through e-commerce and
hard discounters); or the location of origin or source of ingredients and products (including the environmental impact related to
production and packaging of our products).
Consumer preferenc es continuously evolve, due to a variety of factors, includ ing: changes in consumer demographics, including
the aging of the general population and the emer gence of the millennial and younger generations who have differing spending,
consumption and purchasing habits; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of products, including the
presence of added sugar, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products; growing demand for organic, locally or sustainably
sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health ef fects of ingredients or
11
Table of Contents
substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors, artificial sweeteners,
aspartame, caffeine, furfuryl alcohol, high-fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat, sodium, sugar , trans fats or
other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes or other restrictions,
including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concer ns or perceptions regarding packaging materials,
including single-use  and other plastic packaging, and their environmental impact; changes in package or portion size; changes in
social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles;
the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of purchasing products; negative publicity (whether or not valid)
resulting from regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or
comments in the media, including social media, about us, our employees, our products or advertising campaigns and marketing
programs; perceptio n of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture
partners or other third parties or our respective social media posts, business practices or other information disseminated by or
regarding them or us; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions. These factors have in the past and could in the
future reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such
changes can lead to reduced demand for our products or erode our competitive and financial position, resulting in adverse effects
on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Demand for our products is also depe ndent in part on product quality , product and marketing innovation and production and
distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products; improve the quality of existing products; extend
our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories (through acquisitions and innovation, such as increasing non-
carbonated beverage  offerings and other alternatives to, or reformulations of, carbonated beverage offerings); respond to cultural
differences and regional consumer preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new products that are responsive to such
preferences); monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and packaging materials (including to respond to applicable regulations);
develop sweetener alternatives and innovation; increase the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging; create more relevant
and person alized experiences for consumers whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical
environment; improve the production and distribution of our products; enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new
commercial insights ; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including in the e-
commerce channel; maintain our labelin g certifications (e.g., non-GMO) from independent organizations and regulatory authorities
for certain  of our products; and imple ment effective advertising campaigns  and marketing programs, including successfully
adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing
programs.
Although we devote significant resourc es to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to
develop, launch, maintain or distribute  successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including
correctly anticipating or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences) or to develop and effectively execute advertising
and marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers, including through the use of digital technology . Our failure to
make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launc h new products or variants of existing products or
effectively market or distribute our products can reduce demand for our products, result in inventory write-of fs and erode our
competitive and financial position and can adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in laws and regulations relating to the use or disposal of plastics or other product packaging can increase our costs,
reduce demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results
of operations.

Certain of our food and beverage products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all
packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise. In addition, certain of our packaging is not currently
recyclable, compost able or biodegradable. There is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic, including microplastics,
and other packaging waste in the enviro nment, particularly in the world’ s oceans and waterways. As a result, packaging waste that
displays one or more of our brands has in the past and could continue to result in negative publicity (whether or not valid) or reduce
consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
In respons e to these concerns, the United States and many other jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing regulations
or policies designed to increase the susta inability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increase recycling rates or facilitate
the waste manageme nt process or restric t the sale of products in certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from
taxes or fees designe d to incentivize behavior to restrictions or bans on certain products and materials. For example, 24 countries in
the European Union (EU) have established extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, which make manufacturers such as us
responsible for the costs of recycling beverage and food packaging after consumers have used them. EPR policies are also being
contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including certain states in the United States. In addition, 10 states in the
United States as well as a growing number of European countries have a bottle deposit return system in effect, which requires a
deposit charged to consumers to incentivize the return of the beverage containe r. Further , certain jurisdictions have imposed or are
considering imposing other types of regulations or policies, including packagin g taxes, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered
to the plastic bottle,  minimum recycled content mandates, which would require packaging to include a certain percentage of post-
consumer recycled material in a new package, and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use
plastics. These laws and regulations, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our
products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products or result in negative publicity (whether or not valid),
resulting in adverse ef fects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
While we continue to devote significan t resources to increase the recyclability  and sustainability of our packaging, the increased
focus on reducing plastic waste has required and could continue to require us to increase capital expenditures, including requiring
additional investme nts to minimize the amount of plastic across our packaging, including to increase the use of alternative
packaging materials (e.g., glass and aluminum) in certain markets; increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging; and
develop sustainable, bio-based packag ing as a replacement for fossil fuel-based plastic packaging, including flexible film
alternatives for our snacks packaging. Our failure to minimize our plastics use, increase the amount of recycled content in our
packaging or develop sustainable packaging or consumers’ failure to accept such sustainable packaging has in the past and could
continue to reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products  and erode our competitive and financial position.
Further , our reputation can be damaged for failure to achieve our sustainability goals with respect to our plastics use, including our
goal to reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across our beverage portfolio by 2025, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or
are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to packaging or disposal of our products.
Changes in, or failu re to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations can adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The condu ct of our business is subjec t to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental
agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outsid e the United States, including laws and regulations
relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertisin g, marketing, labeling, content, quality , safety ,
transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and
safety practices and protection of person al information. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of
special
13
Table of Contents
importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these
laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emer ging markets, may be less developed or
certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to differing regulations and restrictions in
the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, as is the packaging, disposal and recyclability
of our products. For example, the EU has mandated tethered caps for all bevera ge bottles by 2024 and minimum recycled content
of 25% for PET bottles by 2025 and 30% for all plastic bottles by 2030 and laws mandating various minimum recycled content
thresholds for PET bottles are also in place in Turkey , Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, while the use of recycled content in food and
beverage packaging  is prohibited in a range of countries, for example, in Asia. In addition, these laws and regulations and related
interpretations have changed and could continue to change, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly , as a result of a variety of
factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes have included and could continue to include changes in: food
and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices, including restrictions on the audience to whom
products are marketed; laws and treaties  related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or export of our products
or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or
substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws related to pesticide used by farmers in our supply chain or residual
amounts of pesticide that may be found in certain of our ingredients or produc ts; laws related to traceability requirements for our
supply chain; laws and programs aimed  at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our
products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government funds or programs to purchase certain of our products;
increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding
the effects on health  of ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products, including without limitation those
found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; laws regulating the protection of personal information; cyber -security
regulations; regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures
impacting the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products; accounting rules and interpretations; employment laws; privacy
laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or
utilities; environmen tal laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water treatment and dischar ge of wastewater and air
emissions and laws relating to the disposal, recovery or recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory
requirements or changing interpretation s thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where
our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs,
capital expenditures and higher production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, reputation, financial condition or
results of operations.
The imposition of new laws, regulatio ns or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the
foregoing, including  taxes, labeling, product, production, recovery or recycling requirements, or other limitations on, or pertaining
to, the sale or adve rtisement of certain of our products, ingredients or subst ances contained in, or attributes of, our products,
commodities used in the production of our products or use, disposal, recovery or recyclability of our products and their packaging,
may further alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand
for our products, resulting in adverse ef fects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes
or proposes to impose new requirements  or restrictions, other jurisdictions often follow . For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a
tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or foods, or imposes a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose
similar or other measures that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products. The foregoing has in the past and could
continue to result
14
Table of Contents
in decreas ed demand for certain of our products, adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of
consumption of ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid).
In addition, studies (whether or not scientifically valid) have been and continue to be underway by third parties purporting to assess
the health implications of consumptio n of certain ingredients or substances  present in certain of our products or packaging
materials, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, pesticides (e.g., glyphosate), furfuryl alcohol, added sugars, sodium, saturated fat
and plastic . Third parties have also published documents or studies claiming (whether or not valid) that taxes can address consumer
consumption of sugar -sweetened bever ages and foods high in sugar , sodium or saturated fat. The results of these studies and
documents have contributed to or resul ted in and could continue to contribute to or result in an increase in consumer concerns
(whether or not valid) about the health implications of consumption of certain of our products, an increase in the number of
jurisdictions that impose taxes on our products, or an increase in new labeling, product or production requirements or other
restrictions on the manufacturing, sale or display of our products, resulting in reduced demand for our products, our Company
being subject to lawsuits or new regulations that can adversely affect sales of our products, and other adverse effects on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees,
suppliers, or other third parties with whom we do business can take actions,  intentional or not, that violate these policies and
procedures or applicable laws or regulations or can fail to maintain required documentation sufficient to evidence our compliance
with appli cable laws or regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement
actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgor gement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which can
adversely affect our business, reputatio n, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain regulatory authorities
under whose laws we operate have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or
assets or other sanctions, resulting in an adverse ef fect on the sales of products in our portfolio or damage to our reputation.
In addition , we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environm ental remediation obligations arising in the normal
course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability , toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in
connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our
subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current
and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for reme diation, liability and indemnification costs to differ
materially from the costs we have estim ated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our
estimates or otherwise have an adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or
attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our produc ts. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply
to all beverages, including non-caloric  beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar).
Similarly , some measures apply a singl e tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or
other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the
beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the particular
substance or ingredient levels. For example, Peru revised an existing threshold tax to become a graduated tax, effective June 2019,
in which the per-ounce tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar ,
the higher the per -
15
Table of Contents
ounce tax rate, while  Saudi Arabia expa nded an existing flat tax rate of 50% on the retail price of carbonated soft drinks to include
all sweetened beverages, including non-caloric beverages, effective December 2019. These tax measures, whatever their scope or
form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall
consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the
perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in adverse effects on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Significant addition al labeling or warn ing requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products could reduce
demand for such products and can adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of
ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that
highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances
present in our produ cts. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on or relating to
any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects or other
reproductive harm, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level established by the State of
California.
In addition, a numb er of jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States, have imposed or are considering imposing labeling
requirements, including color -coded labeling of certain food and beverage products where colors such as red, yellow and green are
used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar , sodium or saturated fat. The imposition or proposed
imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption
of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether
or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations can suf fer if we are unable to compete ef fectively .
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private label manufacturers and econom y brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro
brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retail ers focused on locally-sourced products. In many
countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor .
Other beverage, food and snack comp etitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company , Conagra Brands, Inc.,
Kellogg Company , Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company , Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster
Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and Red Bull GmbH.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality ,
product variety, innovation, distribution , advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the
ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and
wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. If we are unable
to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective,
if we fail to invest in and incorporate technology and digital tools across all areas of our business (including the use of data
analytics to enhance our ability to effectively market to consumers), if our comp etitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we
are otherwise unable to ef fectively respond to pricing pressure or
16
Table of Contents
compete effectively  (including in distributing our products effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emer ging
channels of trade, including through e-commerce and hard discounters), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category
share or we may need to increase capit al, marketing or other expenditures, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity or reinvestment initiatives or operating model can have an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our future success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies,
including implemen ting shared business service organizational models while reinvesting back into the business. Our productivity
initiatives help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement productivity
initiatives that we believe will position  our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost
structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and
markets. Some of these measures have yielded and could continue to yield unintended consequences, such as business disruptions,
distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and productivity , and unexpected additional employee
attrition, including the inability to attrac t or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to
lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel adjustments and transitions resulting from these initiatives
and increased competition for employe es with the skills necessary to implement our plans. If we are unable to successfully
implement our productivity initiatives as planned, fail to implement these initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve
expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing these
initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future, or fail to successfully manage business
disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or productivity , we may not realize all or any of the
anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further , in order to
continue to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our
business, which may be limited due to capital constraints. From time to time, we have in the past and could continue to implement
these investment initiatives to enable us to compete more effectively , including investments to increase manufacturing capacity ,
improve innovation,  transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and artificial
intelligence, and enhance brand manage ment through our use of data analytics to develop new commercial and consumer insights.
If we fail to realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of these reinvestment initiatives, our business, financial condition or results
of operations can be adversely af fected.
Our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the
markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufacture d, distributed or sold have been and could continue
to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The results of
elections, referendum s or other political  conditions (including government shutdowns) in these markets have in the past and could
continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or create uncertainty as to
how such laws, regulations and governm ent programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, climate
change regulation, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between
countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and
could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or
adversely affect demand for our products. For example, the United Kingdom’ s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly
referred to as Brexit) is likely to lead to differing laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union and further
global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty . Any changes in, or the imposition of,
17
Table of Contents
new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, referendums or other political
conditions can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in
developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emer ging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the
Middle East, Brazil, China and India. However , there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing
products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular
developing or emer ging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences as to
distribution or otherwise. The following factors can reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our
business in developi ng and emer ging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil
unrest; increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed
countries who export to these markets;  volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these markets; our
inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to
complete divestitures or refranchisings; imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other
restrictions; our inability to hire or retain a highly skilled workforce; imposition of new or increased tarif fs and other impositions on
imported goods or sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these markets, or imposition
of new or increased  sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations or tariffs on the products of such corporations operating in
these mark ets; actions, such as removing  our products from shelves, taken by retailers in response to U.S. trade sanctions, tariffs or
other gove rnmental action or policy; foreign ownership restrictions; nationaliz ation of our assets or the assets of our suppliers,
bottlers, contract manufacturers, distribu tors, joint venture partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the
ingredients or substances used in our products; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the
operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, customers or other third parties;
restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; regulations relating to the
repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly inflationary economies and potential highly
inflationary economies, devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Brazilian real,
Argentine peso and the Mexican peso, or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign
countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries,
from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can
result in the decon solidation of such businesses, such as occurred with respect to our Venezuelan businesses which were
deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter of 2015; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of
doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations,
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices  Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act;
and advers e consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If
we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emer ging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated
with opera ting, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our business,
reputation, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely af fected.
Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
18
Table of Contents
Many of the countri es in which our products are made, manufactured, distribute d and sold have experienced and could continue to
experience uncertain  or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our business or financial
results have in the past and could contin ue to be adversely impacted by uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the United
States and globally , including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including
speculative influences; highly inflationa ry economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of
credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demonetization,
austerity or stimulus measures to manag e economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any
default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or
sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced
demand for our products resulting from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for
economic reasons or otherwise to regio nal, local or private label products or other lower -cost products, or to less profitable sales
channels; or a decre ase in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs
and/or funding requi rements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition , we cannot predict how current or future economic
conditions will affect our customers, consumers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or
other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
In addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial
banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions, may be exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy ,
liquidity events, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other
factors beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy , receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial
institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, can limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into
financial transaction s with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms
commercially accep table to us or at all; can leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk
associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials, including through our use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,
pricing agreements and derivative instru ments, including swaps and futures; or can result in a decline in the market value of our
investments in debt securities, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar
risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufactu rers, distributors and joint venture partners and can
result in their inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products
resulting in canceled orders and/or product delays, which can also have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial
condition or results of operations.
Our busin ess and reputation can suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to,
cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted.
We depend on infor mation systems and technology , some of which are provid ed by third parties, including public websites and
cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to
engage in marketing activities; to enab le and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from
suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage and operate our facilities; to conduct research and development, including through the
use of data analytics; to maintain accurate financial records; to achieve operational ef ficiencies; to comply with regulatory , financial
reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate
electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our customers,
19
Table of Contents
suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and other third parties; and to communicate with our
investors.
Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently , are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more
sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors,
criminal and terrorist organizations, individuals or groups participating in organized crime and insiders) with a wide range of
expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of computing
resources, notoriety , financial fraud, operational disruption, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive
advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take
many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation and identity takeover attempts
to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of
viruses or malware, such as ransomware, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website
defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and
business email compromises. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks, including many of the types
of attacks described  above. Although we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber
incidents, no cyberattack or other cybe r incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations to date.
If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology
infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and training of our
employees, and requiring our third-party  service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint
venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or
other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a
result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment
or telecommunications failures, technology development defects, user errors, lapses in our controls or the malicious or negligent
actions of employe es (including misuse of information they are entitled to access), or from deliberate cyberattacks such as
malicious or disruptive software, phishing, denial of service attacks, malicio us social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our
business can be disrupted and, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors or financial loss; processing inefficiencies; the
loss of, or failure to attract, new customers and consumers; lost revenues or other costs resulting from the disruption or shutdown of
computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities,
or the loss of a competitive advantage due to the unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential
information; the incurrence of costs to restore data and to safeguard against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to,
intellectual property  or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; alteration,
corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which can
cause errors or delays in our financial reporting; damage to our reputation or brands; damage to employee, customer and consumer
relations; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or fines; unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal information of our
employees, customers or consumers; the loss of information and/or business operations disruption resulting from the failure of
security patches to be developed and installed on a timely basis; violation of data privacy , security or other laws and regulations;
and remediation costs.
Further , our information systems and those of our third-party providers, and the information stored therein can be compromised,
including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods, resultin g in unauthorized parties accessing or extracting
sensitive data or confidential information. In the ordinary course of business, we receive, process, transmit and store information
relating to identifiable individuals, primarily employees and former employees. Privacy and data protection laws may be
interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create
inconsistent or
20
Table of Contents
conflicting requirem ents. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws, including with respect to data from residents
of the European Union who are covere d by the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and
residents of the State of California covered by the California Consumer Privacy  Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1,
2020, impose significant costs or challe nges that are likely to increase over time. Failure to comply with existing or future data
privacy laws and regulations can result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations.
We continue to devo te significant resources to network security , backup and disaster recovery , enhancing our internal controls, and
other security meas ures, including training, to protect our systems and data. In addition, our risk management program also
includes periodic review and discussion  by our Board of Directors of analyses of emer ging cybersecurity threats and our plans and
strategies to address them. However , these security measures and processes cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we
will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature
of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
Similar risks exist with respect to the cloud-based service providers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of
our inform ation technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan
administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties
and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that
arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our
business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Moreover , our increased use of mobile
and cloud technologies has heightened these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies are
complex, unpredictable or beyond our control.
While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated
with certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not,
depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an
incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or
shortages of raw materials, energy and other supplies.
We and our business  partners use various raw materials, energy and other suppli es in our business. The principal ingredients we use
in our beverage, food and snack product s are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn
sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit, oats, oranges and other fruits, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar ,
vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins
used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures,
cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and
support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also
important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our
products.
Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experienc ing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable
economic conditions, and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier or are in short supply when
seasonal demand is at its peak. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with
these suppliers or that our contingency plans, including development of ingredients, materials or supplies to replace ingredients,
materials or supplies sourced from such suppliers, will be effective in preven ting disruptions that may arise from shortages or
discontinuation of any ingredient that is sourced from such suppliers. In addition, increasing focus on climate
21
Table of Contents
change, deforestatio n, the use of plastics and energy, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the
global food system is leading to incre ased activism focusing on consumer goods companies, governmental intervention and
consumer response, and can adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials
we need to operate our business. The raw materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and
distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by
many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate
change), fire, natural disasters (such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding), disease or pests (including the
impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty , health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious
outbreaks, such as the recent coronaviru s, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new
or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), limited or sole sources of supply , political uncertainties, acts of terrorism,
governmental instability or currency exchange rates. For example, concerns regarding trade relations between the United States and
China escalated during fiscal 2019, with the United States imposing tariffs on the importation of certain Chinese goods and
retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. good s. Higher duties on existing tariffs or additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a
broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an
increase in supply chain costs that we are not able to offset or otherwise adve rsely impact our results of operations. Shortage of
some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs can adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are
purchased in the open market. The price s we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use
of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. If
commodity price changes result in unex pected or significant increases in raw materials and energy costs, we may be unwilling or
unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against commodity price increases to offset these increased
costs without suf fering reduced volume, revenue, mar gins and operating results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge
price risk do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any
given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities.
Water scarcity can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We and our supplier s, bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners and other third parties use water in the manufacturing
of our products. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality , increasing
focus by governmental and non-governm ental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing
pressure to conserve  and replenish wate r in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our
operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributor , joint venture partners or other third
parties; higher compliance costs; capit al expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to
enhance water efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the
cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers,
distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; failure to achieve our sustainability goals relating to water use; perception
(whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to new, or changes in,
legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Business disruptions can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our abilit y, and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint
venture partners and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our
success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations has occurred in the past and could continue to occur due to any of the
following factors which can impair the ability to make, manufacture, transport,  distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse
weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change) or natural disasters, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake,
wildfire or flooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties or instability in countries in which such products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire;
terrorism; outbreak or escalation of arme d hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or
otherwise; health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the recent coronavirus; supply and commodity
shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which such products
are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the
disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses,
distribution centers or other facilities or those of our suppliers and other third parties who make, manufacture, transport, distribute
and sell products in our portfolio; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures;
power , fuel or water shortages; strikes, labor disputes or lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers; or other
reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the
likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur , has in the past resulted and could
continue to result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional
resources to restore operations.
Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality , safety and integrity can adversely
affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality , safety and integrity , including with
respect to raw mate rials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegation s (whether or not valid) of product quality issues,
mislabeling, misbran ding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce
demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which can adversely af fect our business,
reputation, financial  condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for
consumption or cause injury , illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly
as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we can decide to, or be
required to, recall products in our portfo lio and/or we may be subject to liability  or government action, which can result in payment
of damage s or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction of product
inventory , or result in adverse publicity  (whether or not valid), which can reduce consumer demand and brand equity . Moreover ,
even if allegations of product contami nation or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption are
meritless, the negative publicity surroun ding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes can adversely affect our
reputation or brands. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality , safety and
integrity generally , even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing can adversely
affect our business, reputation, financial  condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we
do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or
other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall
efforts can materially adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Any damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world.
Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past and
could continue to be adversely impacted  by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the
failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental practices for all of our operations and activities, including with respect to
human rights, child labor laws and workplace conditions and safety , or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so;
the failure  to achieve our goals of reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated  fat in certain of our products and of growing our
portfolio of product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals, including with respect to plastic packaging, or to
be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property , including in
the event our brand s are used without our authorization; health concerns (whe ther or not valid) about our products or particular
ingredients or substances in, or attribute s of, our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute
to obesity ; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes,  labeling requirements or other limitations on, or
pertaining to, the sale, display or advert ising of our products; any failure to comply, or perception of a failure to comply , with our
policies and goals, including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugar -sweetened
beverages; our research and development efforts; the recall (voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our
environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, plastics or other packaging, water , energy use and waste
management; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment, including the recyclability or
recoverability of our packaging, or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment; any
failure to achieve our goals with respect to human rights throughout our value chain; the practices of our employees, agents,
customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture  partners or other third parties (including others in
our indust ry) with respect to any of the foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception
of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media;
consumer perception of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the
responses of others in our industry to any of the foregoing.
In addition , we operate globally , which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-
corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdicti ons in which our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold. In the event that we or our employees or agents engage in or are believed to have engaged in improper
activities, we have in the past and could continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings, including enforcement actions, litigation,
loss of sales or other consequences, resulting in damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad. Failure to comply with
local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal control or to provide accurate and timely financial
information can also hurt our reputation.
Further , the popularity of social media and other consumer -oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of
information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices,
advertising campaigns and marketing programs or sponsorship arrangement s; our use of social media or of posts or other
information dissemi nated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint
venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectively to any of
the forego ing, has in the past and could continue to also generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid) that can damage our
reputation.
Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products or employees for any of these or other
reasons has in the past and could continue to result in decreased demand for our products,

resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as requiring additional resources to
rebuild our reputation.
Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or
effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, can adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We regula rly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisiti ons, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and
other strategic trans actions. Issues associated with these activities have in the past and could continue to include, among other
things: our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or syner gies as a result of a transaction,
within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction;
and diversion of management’ s attention from day-to-day operations.
With respe ct to acquisitions, the followi ng factors also have in the past and could continue to pose additional risk risks: our ability
to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company , including integrating the acquired company’ s
manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology
systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining
executives and key employees (both of the acquired company and our company); conforming standards, controls (including internal
control over financi al reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, enviro nmental compliance, health and safety compliance
and compliance with other laws and regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between
us and the acquired company; consolida ting and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures and avoiding increased
operating expenses;  consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;
retaining existing distributors; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; coordinating
geographically dispe rsed organizations;  managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following
completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation.
With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not
have the same goals , strategies, priorities, resources or values as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of
all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners
have in the past and could continue to adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against
us or otherwise damage our reputation and brands and adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increas e our exposure to risks associated with operations
outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and comp liance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United States.
With respect to divestitures and refranc hisings, we have in the past and could continue to be unable to complete or effectively
manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all, resul ting in failure to achieve the anticipated benefits or
cost savin gs from the divestiture or refranchising. Further , as divestitures and refranchisings reduce our direct control over certain
aspects of our busin ess, any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain
can adversely impact our sales or business performance.
Acquisitions or joint ventures that are not successfully completed, integrated into our existing operations or managed effectively , or
divestitures or refranchisings that are not successfully completed or managed

effectively or do not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
A change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses can result in an
impairment charge that materially af fects our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets , as well as other investments and other long-lived
assets annually , during our third quarter , or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable and have recorded impairments in the past. Any changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the
future performance of our reporting units or in determining the fair value of any such reporting unit, including goodwill, indefinite-
lived intan gible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, can adversely affect our results of operations.
Factors considered to determine if an impairment exist include, but are not limited to: significant negative economic or industry
trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that can result in a future increase in the
weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding
assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate future levels of sales,
operating profit or cash flows. While no material impairment charges have been  recorded in the periods presented in this Form 10-
K, we may in the future record impairm ent charges that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods
recognized. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreemen ts with tax authorities can adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.  
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax
rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction can reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and
adversely affect our business, financial  condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a
significant portion of our income. In addition, existing tax laws in the United States and many of the other countries in which our
products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have been and
could in the future be subject to signifi cant change. For example, in Decembe r 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was
signed into law in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these
amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and additional guidance issued by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) may continue to impact our recorded amounts in future periods. In addition, on May 19, 2019, a public
referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1,
2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted in fiscal year 2019, resulti ng in adjustments to our deferred taxes. The future
impact of the TRAF cannot currently be estimated and we continue to monitor and assess the impact of TRAF on our business and
financial results. For further information regarding the impact and potential impact of the TCJ Act and the TRAF , see “Our
Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7. Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including
changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. For example, the Organizat ion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended changes to
numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. These changes have
been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. In connection with the OECD’ s BEPS project, the
OECD has undertaken a new project focused on “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy .” This
project may impact all multinational businesses by reallocating where some profits are taxed and implementing a global model for
minimum taxation. The increasingly complex
26
Table of Contents
global tax environment  has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty , resulting in higher compliance costs and
adverse ef fects on our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow .
We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and
non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. In connection with the OECD’ s BEPS project, companies are
required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of
profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate,
or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final
resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it can have a negative impact
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our conti nued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse
workforce. We compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our
employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively
depends on our ability to retain, develo p and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned
turnover or unsuccessful implementatio n of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief
Executive Officer, or failure to hire and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-
commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive
advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employee s, higher employee turnover or increased employee
benefit costs. Any of the foregoing can adversely af fect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The loss of, or a significant reduction  in sales to, any key customer can adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customer s, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent
bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to
compete effectively . Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition
(financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer , or
the loss of any of our key customers can adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Disruption in the retail landscape, including rapid growth in the e-commerce channel and hard discounters, can adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, includin g the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce
websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services as well as the integration of physical and digital operations
among retailers. We continue to make significant investments in attracting talent to and building our global e-commerce and digital
capabilities. Althoug h we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are unable to maintain and
develop successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers  or otherwise adapt to the growing e-commerce
landscape, while simultaneously maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels, we may
be disadvantaged in certain channels and with certain customers and consumers, which can adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, the growth in e-commerce and hard discounters may result in consumer price
deflation, which may af fect our relationships with key retail
27
Table of Contents
customers. Further , the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure
on us to maintain competitive prices. If these e-commerce and hard discounter retailers were to take significant additional market
share away from traditional retailers and/or we fail to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-commerce landscapes, including
finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for our retail  customers to enable them to grow their businesses,
our ability to maintain and grow our profitability , share of sales or volume and our business, financial condition or results of
operations could be adversely af fected.
Further , the retail landscape continues to be impacted by the increased consol idation of retail ownership and purchasing power ,
particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing
power , which may impact our ability to compete in these areas. Such retailers or buying groups demand improved efficiency , lower
pricing and increased promotional progr ams. Further , should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks,
other distribution channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-
market systems and brand equity may be eroded. In addition, such consolidation can continue to adversely impact our smaller
customers’ ability to compete effectively , resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders
of our products. Further , the growth of hard discounters that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling
predominantly priva te label brands may continue to reduce our ability to sell our products through such retailers. Failure to
appropriately respon d to any of the foregoing, including failure to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our
customers, can reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and product availability at our retailers, adversely affect our ability
to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets would be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential
downgrade of our credit ratings.
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors,
including our cash generating capability , levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial
strength generally , as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-curre nt state of the economy and our industry generally .
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether as a
result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access
capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity . We expect to
maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to
global credit market s at favorable intere st rates. However , any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings can impair our
ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically , and therefore require
us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market
can also be adversely affected if a credi t rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An
increase in our borrowing costs, limita tions on our ability to access the globa l capital and credit markets or a reduction in our
liquidity can adversely af fect our financial condition and results of operations.
If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize informa tion technology systems and networks effectively ,
our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted.
We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize information technology support services and
administrative functions in certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and
certain finance and accounting functions . We may enter into new or additional agreements for shared services in other functions in
the future to achieve cost savings and ef ficiencies as we continue to migrate to shared business service or ganizational models across
our business
28
Table of Contents
operations. In addition, we increasingly utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to
process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees,
customers, consumers and other third parties. Failure by these third-party service providers or vendors to perform ef fectively , or our
failure to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal
requirements), has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings, additional costs to
correct errors made by such service providers, damage to our reputation or our being subject to litigation, claims, legal or
regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business
disruption, processin g inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or
otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a
negative impact on employee morale. In addition, the management of multiple third-party service providers increases operational
complexity and decreases our control.
We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial
processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business
transformation initia tive, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. If we do not
allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if
we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and
efficiently , and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which can result in the loss of customers or consumers and
revenue. In addition , the failure to either deliver the applications on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,
can lead to business  disruption and loss of customers or consumers and reven ue. In connection with these implementations and
resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls,
including our internal control over finan cial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. To date,
this transition has not materially af fected, and we do not expect it to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Because our
consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United
States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar , are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the
United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil , generate a significant portion of our
net revenu e. In addition, we purchase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous
markets and in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency
exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and
operations or damage our reputation.
There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures,
weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has
a negative effect on agricultural productivity , we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain
commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits and potatoes.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may disrupt the
productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain and unfavorab ly impact the demand for, or our consumers’ ability
to purchase, our products.
29
Table of Contents
Concern over clima te change may resul t in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to
reduce or mitigate the effects of green house gases. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory
obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency , we may experience
disruptions in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and be required to make additional investments in
facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular , increasing regula tion of fuel emissions can substantially increase the
cost of energy, including fuel, required  to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby substantially
increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change can
negatively af fect our business and operations
In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact  on the environment or perception (whether or not
valid) of our failure  to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or
regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity , resulting in an adverse effect on our business,
reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
There is also increas ed focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers
on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and recyclability or
recoverability of packaging, including plastic. Our reputation can be damaged  if we or others in our industry do not act, or are
perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment.
A portion of our workforce is represented by unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or
strikes or work stoppages, can cause our business to suf fer.
Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by
collective bargaining  agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions can occur if we are unable to renew
these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are unable to otherwise manage
changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or lead to a loss of sales,
resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing,
renegotiated or new collective bargainin g agreements can also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement
future operational changes to enhance our ef ficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy .
If we are not able to adequately protec t our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property
rights of others, the value of our produ cts or brands, or our competitive position, can be reduced, resulting in an adverse impact
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient
formulas, trademark s, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to
a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment
used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent
and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our
intellectual property , although the laws of various jurisdictions have differing levels of protection of intellectual property . If we fail
to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and trade secrets, including our ingredient
formulas, or if there  is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property , the value of
our produ cts and brands, or our competitive position, can be reduced, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing
products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly ,
30
Table of Contents
such findi ng can have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our
ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products.
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We and our subsidia ries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations,
including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and
ingredients including sugar , sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by
us of intellectual property rights of others, environmental, privacy , employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to
our compl iance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate such matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes
and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. These matters are inherently uncertain
and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselve s in these matters, or that our assessment of the
materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate
outcome of such matters. In the event that management’ s assessment of actual or potential claims and proceedings proves
inaccurate or litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries or investigations that are material arise in the future, there may be a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Responding to litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries,
and investigations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant
resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image, resulting in an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Many factors can adversely af fect the price of our publicly traded securities.
Many factors can adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are beyond
our control, have in the past and could continue to include, but are not limite d to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in
financial or tax reporting and changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition
and results; investor perceptions of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions by shareholders or
others seeking to influence our business strategies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business,
strategies and performance or those of our competitors; developments relating to pending litigation, claims, inquiries or
investigations; changes in laws and regulations applicable to our products or business operations; trading activity in our securities
or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our securities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our share
repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the outcome of referenda and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those
we have or have not taken in the past or may or may not take in the future as part of our continuous review of our corporate
structure and our strategy , including as a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, have not and may not in the
future have the impact we intend, resulting in adversely effects on the price of our securities. The above factors, as well as the other
risks included in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” can adversely af fect the price of our securities.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have received no written comments  regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180
days or more preceding the end of our 2019  year and that remain unresolved.

Item 2. Properties.
Our principal executive office located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are
our most significant corporate properties.
In connection with making, marketing,  distributing and selling our products, each division utilizes manufacturing, processing,
bottling and product ion plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research
and development facilities and other facilities, all of which are either owned or leased.
Significant properties by division are as follows:
•FLNA ’s research and development facility in Plano, T exas, which is owned.
•QFNA ’s food plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which is owned.
•PBNA ’s research and development facility in Valhalla, New York, and a Tropicana plant in Bradenton, Florida, both of
which are owned.
•LatAm’ s three snack plants in Mexico (one in Celaya and two in V allejo), all of which are owned.
•Europe’ s snack plant in Kashira, Russia , its dairy plant in Moscow , Russia, and its fruit juice plant in Zeebrugge, Belgium,
all of which are owned.
•AMESA ’s snack plant in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is leased.
•APAC’s snack plant in W uhan, China, which is owned.
•Our primary concentrate plants in Cork,  Ireland and in Singapore, all of which are either owned or leased. Our concentrate
plants in Cork, Ireland are shared by our PBNA, Europe and AMESA segmen ts and our concentrate plant in Singapore is
shared by our PBNA and AP AC segments.
•A shared service center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is primarily shared by our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA
segments, which is leased.
Most of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above,
we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distributi on centers that are owned or leased by our contract
manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties
generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current
operations.
Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings.
We and our subsidia ries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations.
While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty , management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosur es.
Not applicable.

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
PepsiCo is a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay , Gatorade,
Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we
make, market, distri bute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in
more than 200 countries and territories
Everything we do is driven by an approach we call Winning with Purpose. Winning with Purpose is our guide for achieving
accelerated, sustaina ble growth that includes our mission, to Create More Smiles with Every Sip and Every Bite; our vision, to Be
the Globa l Leader in Convenient Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purp ose; and The PepsiCo Way, seven behaviors that
define our shared culture.
Winning with Purpo se is designed to help us meet the needs of our shareholders, customers, consumers, partners and communities,
while caring for our planet and inspiring our associates.
This strategy is also designed to address key challenges facing our Company , including: shifting consumer preferences and
behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce;
continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape.
To adapt to these challenges, we intend to continue to focus on becoming Faster , Stronger , and Better:
•Faster by winning in the marketplace, being more consumer -centric and accel erating investment for topline growth. This
includes broadening our portfolios to win locally in convenient foods and beverages, fortifying our North American
businesses, and accelerating our international expansion, with disciplined focus on markets where we see a strong
likelihood of prevailing over our competition.
•Stronger by continui ng to transform our capabilities, cost, and culture by levera ging scale and technology in global markets
across our operations and winning locally . This includes continuing to focus on driving savings through holistic cost
management to reinvest to succeed in the marketplace, developing and scaling core capabilities through technology , and
building dif ferentiated talent and culture.
•Better by continuing to focus our sustain ability agenda on helping to build a more sustainable food system and investing in
six priority areas: next generation agriculture, water stewardship, plastic packaging, products, climate change, and people.
We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.

Other Relationships
Certain members of our Board of Direc tors also serve on the boards of certain  vendors and customers. These Board members do
not partici pate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and
customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms  negotiated with other vendors and customers. In
addition, certain of our employees serve  on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo
and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
Our Business Risks
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which
our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in a challeng ing environment, experiencing unstable economic,
political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, and currency controls or fluctuations. We
continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to
potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are
considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their
packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the
production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverab ility of our packaging. These taxes and regulations
vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only
to beverag es with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of
packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and
increased recycling rates or facilitate waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.
We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we
sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packag ing used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we
cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitation s on our products or their packaging may take, and
therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations
and limita tions may impact us and our competitors differently . We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations
in the jurisdictions in which our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to
potentially mitigate  the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative
measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.
In addition , our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through
e-commerce website s and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and
digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail
landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, distribute our products
effectively through all existing and emer ging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future
results.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States . Our provisional measurement period ended in the
fourth quarter of 2018 and while  our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional
guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our record ed amounts after December 29, 2018. For further
information, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements.

On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain

million  related to the impact of the TRAF . Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to
result in adjustments to our consolidate d financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the
TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our
business and financ ial results.  See “Our  Critical Accounting Policies ” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for
further information.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks
and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To
identify , assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’ s operations, we leverage an
integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:
•PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management framework. One of the
Board’ s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the
Company’ s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’ s top risks. The Board receives updates
on key risks throughout the year, inclu ding risks related to cybersecurity . In addition, the Board has tasked designated
Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk manageme nt, and the Committees report to the Board
regularly on these matters.
◦The Audit  Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’ s risk
management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’ s oversight of financial, compliance and employee
safety risks facing PepsiCo;
◦The Comp ensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’ s employee compensation policies and practices to
assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;
◦The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’ s
governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and
◦The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’ s
policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability and public policy matters.
•The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management
group, including PepsiCo’ s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify , assess,
prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety , reputational and other risks. The PRC is also
responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation ef forts to the Board;
•Division and key country risk committ ees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to
identify , assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;
•PepsiCo’ s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk managem ent process, provides ongoing guidance,
tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential
risks and facilitates ongoing communication between

the parties , as well as with PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the
Board;
•PepsiCo’ s Corporate  Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic
audit and review procedures; and
•PepsiCo’ s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.
Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the
identification and effective implementat ion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives.
Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” for further discussion of our market risks, and see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information on our
non-cancelable purchasing commitments.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market
fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and
our hedgin g policies . See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical
plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary , deflationary and recessiona ry conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our
products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
Commodity Prices
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion  as of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 . At the end
of 2019 , the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying
commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2019  by $106 million .
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolidated  net revenue in 2019 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada,
the United Kingdom, China and Brazil , collectively , comprising approximately 22% of our consolidated  net revenue in 2019 . As a
result, we are exposed to foreign exch ange risks in the international markets  in which our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold. Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign
currency purchases,  foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business, as well as the proposed
acquisition of Pioneer Foods. During 2019 , unfavora ble foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points,
reflecting declines in the euro, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Argentine peso. Currency declines against the U.S.
dollar which are not of fset could adversely impact our future financial results.
45
Table of Contents
In addition , volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico , the Middle East, Russia and Turkey , and currency
controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs
or sanction s or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We
also contin ue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’ s withdrawal from the European
Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the
economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses.
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion  as of December 28, 2019  and $2.0 billion  as of
December 29, 2018 . At the end of 2019 , we estim ate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have
increased our net unrealized losses in 2019  by $135 million .
The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.5 billion  as of December 28, 2019
and $0.9 billion  as of December 29, 2018 .
Inter est Rates
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $5.0 billion  as of December 28, 2019  and $10.5 billion  as of December 29,
2018 . Assuming year-end 2019  investmen t levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in intere st rates would have
decreased our net interest expense in 2019  by $25 million  due to higher cash and cash equivalents as compared with our variable
rate debt.

OUR FINANCIAL RESUL TS
Results of Operations — Consolidated Review
Volume
Beverage volume reflects sales of conce ntrate and beverage products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks to authorized
bottlers, independen t distributors and retailers. Concentrate beverage volume is sold to franchised-owned bottlers and independent
distributors. Finished goods beverage volume is sold to retailers and independent distributors and includes direct shipments to
retailers. Beverage volume is measured in bottler case sales (BCS), which conv erts all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric.
We believe that BCS is a valuable meas ure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the customer level. In our
franchised-owned business, beverage revenue is based on concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), representing physical
concentrate volume shipments to such customers. As a result, for our franchise-owned businesses, BCS and CSE are not typically
equal during any given period due to seasonality , timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other
factors. Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected  in our reported volume. PBNA, LatAm, Europe,
AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea
products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction
with third  parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In
addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance
with T ingyi.
Food and snack volume is reported on a system-wide basis, which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled
affiliates of snacks bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. In addition, FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra
refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group.
Servings
Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common
servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are
converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.
In 2019 , total servings increased 4% compared to 2018 , prim arily reflecting our acquisition of SodaStream. In 2018, total servings
increased 1% compared to 2017.

See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
47
Table of Contents
2019
Operating profit grew 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by
productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth, partial ly offset by certain operating cost increases, a 5-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The operating profit margin
decline primarily reflects higher advertising and marketing expenses.
Favorable mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate unallocated expenses (see “Items Affecting
Comparability”) contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. Gains on the refranchising of a portion of our beverage
business in Thailand  and our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS in the prior year reduced
operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.
2018
Operating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.5 percentage points. The operating profit performance was
driven by certain operating cost increases and a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by
productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth.
The impact of refran chising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan in 2017 and a 2017 gain associated with the sale of our
minority stake in Britvic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2.5 percentage points. These impacts were offset by
a 2-percentage-point positive impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand and our entire beverage
bottling operations and snack distribu tion operations in CHS in 2018. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting
Comparability”) negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points and decreased operating profit margin by
0.5 percentage points, primarily due to higher mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate
unallocated expenses.
Results of Operations — Division Review
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with a recent strategic
realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates
resources to, our reportable segments. Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to
reflect the new or ganizational structure.  See “Our Operations” in “Item 1. Business” for further information.
See “Non- GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results
and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below , “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over -year impact of discrete
pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different
countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over -year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package,
discounts and allowances. Additionally , “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity , including the
impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity
investees .

point to the net revenue growth. Volume decreased 1%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in
non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a mid-single-digit increase in our overall
water portfolio, partially of fset by a low-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice drinks portfolio.
Operating profit decreased 4%, reflect ing certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, an 8-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and the volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net
pricing and productivity savings. Year-over -year gains on asset sales negatively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit
performance. A gain associated with an insurance recovery positively contributed 1 percentage point to current-year operating
profit performance and was offset by less-favorable insurance adjustments compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted
the current-year operating profit performance by 1 percentage point. Additionally , a prior -year bonus extended to certain U.S.
employees in connection with the TCJ Act positively contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit performance.

were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher
advertising and marketing expenses. Higher restructuring and impairment charges and unfavorable foreign exchange reduced
operating profit growth by 3 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively .

Net revenue decreased 0.5%, reflecting a 4-percentage-point impact of the 2017 refranchising of a portion of our beverage business
in Jordan, partially of fset by ef fective net pricing and volume growth.
Snacks volume grew 2.5%, reflecting double-digit growth in India and Pakistan, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the
Middle East and a low-single-digit decline in South Africa.
Beverage volume grew 1%, reflecting mid-single-digit growth in India, high-single-digit growth in Nigeria and low-single-digit
growth in Pakistan, partially of fset by a mid-single-digit decline in the Middle East.
Operating profit decreased 16%, reflecting a 22-percentage-point impact of the 2017 refranchising of a portion of our beverage
business in Jordan, certain operating cost increases and a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts
were partially of fset by the ef fective net pricing and productivity savings.

2019
Net revenu e increased 4.5%, reflecting volume growth and effective net pricing, partially offset by a 3-percentage-point impact of
unfavorable foreign exchange and a 2-percentage-point impact of the prior -year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business
in Thailand.
Snacks volume grew 6%, reflecting double-digit growth in China and mid-single-digit growth in Thailand, partially of fset by a low-
single-digit decline in Indonesia. Additionally , Australia and T aiwan each experienced low-single-digit growth.
Beverage volume grew 4%, reflecting double-digit growth in Vietnam and Thailand and mid-single-digit growth in the Philippines.
Additionally , China experienced low-single-digit growth.
Operating profit decreased 23%, primarily reflecting a 23-percentage-point impact of the gain on the prior -year refranchising of a
portion of our beverage business in Thailand. Additionally , certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing
expenses negatively impacted operating profit performance. These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and
productivity savings. Higher restructuring and impairment charges negatively impacted operating profit performance by 6
percentage points.
2018
Net revenue decreased 3%, reflecting an 11-percentage-point impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in
Thailand, partially of fset by net volume growth and ef fective net pricing.
Snacks volume grew 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in China, partially offset by a slight decline in Taiwan. Additionally ,
Thailand experienced high-single-digit growth and Indonesia and Australia each experienced low-single-digit growth.
Beverage volume declined slightly , reflecting a double-digit decline in the Philippines, partially offset by double-digit growth in
Vietnam, low-single-digit growth in China and mid-single-digit growth in Thailand.
Operating profit increased 54%, reflecting a 35-percentage-point net impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in
Thailand. The net volume growth, productivity savings and the effective net pricing also contributed to operating profit growth.
These impacts were partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses and certain operating cost increases. Higher

2019
Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense increased $342 million, primarily reflecting settlement charges of $220 million
related to the purchase of a group annuit y contract and settlement charges of $53 million related to one-time lump sum payments to
certain former employees who had vested benefits.
Net interest expense decreased $284 million  reflecting the prior -year charge of $253  million in connection with our cash tender and
exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes, as well as gains on the
market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability . This decrease also
reflects lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances. These impacts were partially of fset by lower interest income due
to lower average cash balances.
The reported tax rate increased 57.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior -year other net tax benefits related to the
reorganization of our international operations, which increased the current- year reported tax rate by 47 percentage points.
Additionally , the prior -year favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all
open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively , increased the current-year reported tax rate by 8
percentage points.  See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 42% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 41%. Items

Table of Contents
both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 38
percentage points.
2018
Other pension and retiree medical bene fits income increased $65 million, reflecting the impact of the $1.4 billion discretionary
pension contribution to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States, as well as the recognition of net
asset gains, partially of fset by higher amortization of net losses.
Net intere st expense increased $312 million reflecting a charge of $253 million in connection with our cash tender and exchange
offers, prim arily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. This increase also reflects higher
interest rates on debt balances, as well as losses on the market value of investm ents used to economically hedge a portion of our
deferred compensation liability . These impacts were partially offset by higher interest income due to higher interest rates on cash
balances.
The reported tax rate decreased 85.6 percentage points, reflecting both other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our
international operati ons, which reduced the reported tax rate by 45 percentage  points, and the 2017 provisional net tax expense
related to the TCJ Act, which reduced the 2018 reported tax rate by 25 percentage points. Additionally , the favorable conclusion of
certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years
2012 and 2013, collectively , reduced the reported tax rate by 7 percentage points. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial
statements for further information.
Net incom e attributable to PepsiCo increased 158% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 160%.
Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) positively  contributed 150 percentage points to net income

Non-GAAP Measur es
Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S.
GAAP . We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our
annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain
employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form  10-K provides additional information to facilitate
comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency
on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our
performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that
could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performan ce or trends. Examples of items for which we may
make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans;
amounts associated with mergers, acqui sitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items;
charges or adjustme nts related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts
related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or
exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets.  See below and “Items Affecting
Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 
Non-GAAP informa tion should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP .
57
Table of Contents
In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comp arable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by
other companies.
The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below .
Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/income,
interest expense, provision for/benefit from income taxes, net income attribu table to noncontr olling interests and net income
attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability , operating profit, adjusted for items affecting
comparability , and net income attributab le to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability , and
the corr esponding constant curr ency gr owth rates
These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not
qualify for hedge accounting, restructuri ng and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, inventory fair
value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily associated with our acquisition of SodaStream, pension-related
settlement charges, net tax related to the TCJ Act, other net tax benefits and charges related to cash tender and exchange offers (see
“Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating
profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability , and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for
items affecting comparability , on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency
exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior -year period. In order to compute our
constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average
foreign exchange rates and then multiply  or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior -year average foreign exchange rates.
We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we
believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance.
Organic r evenue gr owth
We define  organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the
impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Starting in 2018, our reported results reflected the accounting
policy election taken in conjunction with the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance to exclude from net revenue and cost of
sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governme ntal authorities on revenue-producing transactions
not alread y excluded. Our 2018 organic revenue growth excluded the impact of approximately $75 million of these taxes
previously recognized in net revenue.
We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items
that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year .
See “Net Revenue and Or ganic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information.
Free cash flow
We define  free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activiti es less capital spending, plus sales of property , plant and
equipment . Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,
we believe  that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe  investors should also consider net capital spending
when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt
repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since
we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
58
Table of Contents
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.
Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability
We define  ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt
obligations and quarterly average comm on shareholders’ equity . Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods
exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly , the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other
companies use to calculate their ROIC.
We believ e this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC,
excluding items affecting comparability , to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it
removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects
how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , as
ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items
affecting comparability . We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , provides
useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital
allocation ef ficiency .
See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

(a)Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax
jurisdiction.
Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural
products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period
with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division
results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the
economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate
unallocated expenses.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to
further simplify , harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and
60
Table of Contents
information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our
manufacturing and supply chain footprint.  In connec tion with this plan, we expec t to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5
billion , of which  we have incurred $508 million  plan to date through December 28, 2019  and cash expenditures of approximately
$1.6 billion , of which we have incurred approximately $261 million  plan to date through December 28, 2019 . We expect to incur
pre-tax charges of approximately $450 million and cash expenditures of approx imately $400 million in our 2020 financial results,
with the balance to be reflected in our 2021 through 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash
from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2020 and 2021
results.
2014 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the
previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion  and $960 million , respectively .
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans.
We regularly evaluate productivity initia tives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to
our consolidated financial statements.
Inventory Fair V alue Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges
In 2019 , we recorded inventory fair value adjus tments and merger and integration charges of $55 million  ($47 million  after-tax or
$0.03  per share), including $46 million  in our Europe segment, $7 million  in our AMESA segment and $2 million  in corporate
unallocated expenses. These charges are primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in
SodaStream’ s balance sheet at the acquisition date, as well as mer ger and integration char ges, including employee-related costs.
In 2018 , we record ed merger and integration charges of $75 million ($0.05 per share), including $57 million  in our Europe segment
and $18 million in corporate unallocated expenses, related to our acquisition of SodaStream. These charges include closing costs,
advisory fees and employee-related costs.
See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Pension-Related Settlement Charges
In 2019 , we recorded pension settlement charges of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share), reflecting settlement
charges of $220 million  ($170 million  after-tax or $0.12  per share) related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and
settlement charges of $53 million  ($41 million  after-tax or $0.03  per share ) related to one-time lump sum payments to certain
former employees who had vested benefits.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Net T ax Related to the TCJ Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. 
In 2017, we recorded a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion  ($1.70  per share) associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act.
We recognized net tax benefits of $8 million  ($0.01  per share) and $28 million  ($0.02  per share) in 2019  and 2018 , respectively ,
related to the TCJ Act.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
61
Table of Contents
Other Net T ax Benefits
In 2018, we reorganized our internation al operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result,
we recogn ized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share). Also in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits associated
with both the conclu sion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the
audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS,
collectively , resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $717 million ($0.50 per share).
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Charges Related to Cash T ender and Exchange Of fers
In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million  ($191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in connection
with our cash tender  and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, bridge loan
facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term
debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to
fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments, the proposed acquisition of
Pioneer Foods and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of
commercial paper , bridge loan facilities and long-term debt and cash and cash equivalents. However , there can be no assurance that
volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially
acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our revolving credit facilities and
bridge loan facilities. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for further discussion.
As of December 28, 2019 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidi aries subject to currency
controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in
our conso lidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 28, 2019 , our mandatory
transition tax liability was $3.3 billion , which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect
to pay approximatel y $0.1 billion of this liability in 2020 . See “Credit Facilities and Long-T erm Contractual Commitments.” Any
additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability . See Note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are impacted
by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to season al and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally
lowest in the first quarter . On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our
business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency
initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
The table below summarizes our cash activity:  
 2019  2018  2017
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,649  $ 9,415  $ 10,030
Net cash (used for)/provided by investing activities $ (6,437 ) $ 4,564  $ (4,403 )
Net cash used for financing activities $ (8,489 ) $(13,769 ) $ (4,186 )
Operating Activities
During 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities was $9.6 billion , compared to $9.4 billion  in the prior year. The operating
cash flow performan ce primarily reflects lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year, partially
offset by higher net cash tax payments in the current year .
During 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 billion, compare d to $10.0 billion in 2017. The operating cash flow
performance primarily reflects discretionary contributions of $1.5 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans in 2018, partially
offset by lower net cash tax payments in 2018.
Investing Activities
During 2019 , net cash used for investing activities was $6.4 billion , primarily  reflecting $4.1 billion of net capital spending, as well
as $1.9 billion of the remaining cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream.
63
Table of Contents
During 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 billion, primarily reflecting net maturities and sales of debt
securities with maturities greater than three months of $8.7 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $3.1 billion and $1.2
billion of cash paid, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financ ial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities.
We expect 2020  net capital spending to be approximately $5 billion .
Financing Activities
During 2019 , net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $8.3 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0
billion and debt redemptions of $1.0 billion, partially of fset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.6 billion.
During 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $13.8 billion, primarily  reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.9 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0
billion, cash tender and exchange of fers of $1.6 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.4 billion.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.
We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including  our dividend policy and share repurchase activity .
On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of
PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 13, 2020 , we announced
a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in
June 2020 . We expect to return a total of approximately $7.5 billion to shareholders  in 2020  through share repurchases of
approximately $2 billion and dividends of approximately $5.5 billion.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.”
The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected in our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow .

We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.  We expec t to
continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial
paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets
at favorab le interest rates. However , see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our
credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any down grade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not
as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our

future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.
In addition, any downgrade of our curre nt short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market
with the same flexib ility that we have experienced historically , and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive
types of debt financi ng. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for
further discussion.

Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount
or timing of any such settlements. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in the table above as it is negotiated on an
annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in the table above. See Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe
could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity .
We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans
and plastic  bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers
order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly . Consequently , transactions between our
independent bottlers  and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party , we could be
liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An apprec iation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require
management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly
impact our financia l results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of
underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical
accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. We applied our critical accounting policies
and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting
policies with our Audit Committee.
66
Table of Contents
Our critical accounting policies are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales
of beverag e products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipmen t or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also when  control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that
do not allow for a right of return. Howe ver, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and
out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly ,
our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record
reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estima te and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility , write-of f
history , the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.
Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to
regulate the quantity of product shipped  or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with
customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we
monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to
customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incen tives, discounts, advertising and other marketing
activities. Sales incentives and discount s are primarily accounted for as a reduc tion of revenue and include payments to customers
for performing activities on our behalf , such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products,
payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided
to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers  and customer volume rebates, are based on annual
targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-
end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and
require management  judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences
between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such
differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized
during the year as incurred.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies,
including total marketplace spending.

Table of Contents
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were develop ed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as
incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first
assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any
excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estim ates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a
number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and
future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believe that a brand has an indefinite  life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent
and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not
met, brand s are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected
life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation  of a number of factors, including market share,
consumer awareness, brand history , future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic
environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights
to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,
many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these
franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these
franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these
franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the
remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using eithe r a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter , or more frequently
if circumstances indicate that the carry ing value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we
determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and
significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessme nt indicates that it is more likely than not that an
impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, estimated fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions
underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management
judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeco nomic and other factors to estimate future levels of
sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and
goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information
and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assump tions could be adversely impacted by certain of the
risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.”
68
Table of Contents
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Income T ax Expense and Accruals
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing
arrangements, availa ble to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our
annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when , despite our belief that our tax return positions are
fully supportable, we believe that certa in positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these
reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax
laws or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
An estima ted annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item
recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time
as that item. W e consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior -year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financ ial statements is different than that reported in our
tax returns  (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,
and some differences reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future
years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolid ated financial statements. We establish valuation
allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized . Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated
financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return
but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a resul t of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of
$2.5 billion  ($1.70  per share) in  the fourth quarter of 2017.
We record ed a net tax benefit of $28 million  ($0.02  per share) in 2018, related to the TCJ Act. Our provisional measurement period
ended in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while  our accoun ting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be comp lete,
additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In
2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million  ($0.01  per share) related to the TCJ Act, including the impact of
additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019 and adjustmen ts related to the filing of our 2018 U.S. federal tax
return.  See further information in “Items Af fecting Comparability .”
On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain
provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes.  During 2019 , we recorded net tax expense of $24
million  related to the impact of the TRAF . Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to
result in adjustments to our consolidated financial
69
Table of Contents
statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we
will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results.
In 2019 , our annual tax rate was 21.0%  compared to (36.7)%  in 2018 , as discussed in “Other Consolidated Results.” The tax rate
increased 57.7 percentag e points compared to 2018 , primarily reflecting the prior -year other net tax benefits related to the
reorganization of our international operations, which increased the current- year reported tax rate by 47 percentage points.
Additionally , the prior -year favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all
open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively , increased the current-year reported tax rate by 8
percentage points.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based
on either years of service or a combinat ion of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for
medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally , our share of retiree
medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the
remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and
administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220
million  ($170 million  after -tax or $0.12  per share).
Also in 2019, certai n former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option
of receivin g a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’ s pension benefit. This transaction triggered
a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million  ($41 million  after-tax or $0.03  per share). Collectively , the group annuity
contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in
2019 of $273 million ($21 1 million  after -tax or $0.15  per share).
Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were reorganized into Plan A and the PepsiCo
Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I) to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and provide additional flexibility in
evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility . Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the
average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized
over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of these changes, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost
decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017,
primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.
See “Items Af fecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
Our Assumptions
The determ ination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount
of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical
expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the
year (servi ce cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains
and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our
funded plans.
70
Table of Contents
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover , retirement age and mortality;
•the expected return on assets in our funded plans;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and
•for pensio n and retiree medical expense , the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs
and the present value of liabilities.
Certain assumptions  reflect our historica l experience and management’ s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial
assumptions are reviewed annually , except in the case of an interim remeasurem ent due to a significant event such as a curtailment
or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the
measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term corporate debt securities with
maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the
discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and
amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financia l statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’
investment strategy . Although we review  our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year
do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
The health  care trend rate used to deter mine our retiree medical plans’ liability and expense is reviewed annually . Our review is
based on our claims  experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care
industry . Our review  of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes
in medical carriers.
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:  
 2020  2019  2018
Pension      
Service cost discount rate 3.4% 4.4% 3.7%
Interest cost discount rate 2.8% 3.9% 3.2%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.6% 6.8% 6.9%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.2% 3.2% 3.2%
Retiree medical      
Service cost discount rate 3.2% 4.3% 3.6%
Interest cost discount rate 2.6% 3.8% 3.0%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.8% 6.6% 6.5%
Current health care cost trend rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.8%
In 2019, we incurred  pension settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract of $220 million and one-time
lump sum settlements of $53 million to certain former employees who had vested benefits. In addition, based on our assumptions,
we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2020  primarily driven by the recognition of fixed income
gains on plan assets and the impact of approved plan contributions, primarily of fset by the decrease in discount rates.
71
Table of Contents
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our
benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrea se in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would
individually increase 2020  pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
Assumption  Amount
Discount rates used in the calculation of expense  $ 48
Expected rate of return  $ 44
Funding
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in
accordance with applicable tax regula tions that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the
employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally , we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be
currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulat ory funding requirements, we generally fund these
plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these
benefits.
We made discretiona ry contributions to Plan A in the United States of $150 million in January 2020, $400 million in 2019 and $1.4
billion in 2018.
Our pensio n and retiree medical contrib utions are subject to change as a result  of many factors, such as changes in interest rates,
deviations between actual and expected  asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different
opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — Basis of Pr esentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accom panying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the
consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain
other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership intere st, our ability to exercise significant influence over
the operati ng or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other
affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As
such, our V enezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production
planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and
delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in
determining, among  other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical
accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived
brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well
as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our
estimates as circums tances change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ
significantly from these estimates.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. While
our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantia lly all of our international operations report on a
monthly calendar basis. Certain operati ons in our Europe segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart details
our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented:
Quarter  United States and Canada  International
First Quarter  12 weeks  January , February
Second Quarter  12 weeks  March, April and May
Third Quarter  12 weeks  June, July and August
Fourth Quarter  16 weeks  September , October , November and December
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amoun ts. All per share amounts reflect common per share
amounts, assume dilution unless otherw ise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the
prior years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
Our Divisions
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned our ESSA and AMENA reportable segments to be consistent
78
Table of Contents
with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance
of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. As a result, our bevera ge, food and snack businesses in North Africa, the
Middle East and South Asia that were part of our former AMENA segment and our businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa that were part
of our former ESSA  segment are now reported together as our AMESA segment. The remaining beverage, food and snack
businesses that were part of our former AMENA segment are now reported together as our APAC segment and our beverage, food
and snack businesses in Europe are now reported as our Europe segment.
These changes did not impact our FLNA, QFNA, PBNA or LatAm reportable segments or our consolidated financial results.
Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new or ganizational structure.
We are or ganized into seven  reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:
1)FLNA, which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada;
2)QFNA, which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada;
3)PBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;
4)LatAm, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America;
5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe;
6)AMESA, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and
7)APAC, which includes all of our beve rage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and
China region.
Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a
wide varie ty of convenient beverages,  foods and snacks, serving customers  and consumers in more than 200 countries and
territories with our lar gest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil .
The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described  in Note 2, except for the following allocation
methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisi ons are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions
as an incremental employee compensation cost.
79
Table of Contents
The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:
 2019 2018 2017
FLNA 13% 13% 13%
QFNA 1% 1% 1%
PBNA 17% 18% 18%
LatAm 7% 8% 7%
Europe 17% 9% 9%
AMESA 3% 4% 5%
APAC 5% 4% 4%
Corporate unallocated expenses 37% 43% 43%
The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market
conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual
expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Expense
Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between
the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is
reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.
Derivatives
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural
products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period
with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division
results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the
economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate
unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative
purposes.
Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows:

(a) Our primary performance obligation is the distributio n and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, with our food and snack business
representing approximately 55% of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally , LatAm’ s food and snack business is approximately 90% of the segme nt’s net revenue,
Europe’ s beve rage business and food and snack business are approximately 55% and 45%, respectively , of the segment’ s net revenue, AMESA ’s beverage business and
food and snack business are approximately 40% and 60%, respectively , of the segment’ s net revenue and APAC’s beverage business and food and snack business are
approximately 25% and 75%, respectively , of the segment’ s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated
bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40% of our consolidated net revenue. Generally , our
80
Table of Contents
finished good s beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the
manufacture of finished goods beverages. See Note 2 for further information.
Corporate Unallocated Expenses
Corporate unallocated expenses includ e costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity
derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives,
unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, and certain other items.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales
of beverag e products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipmen t or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also when  control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are
accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts.
The transfer of contr ol of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.
However , our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store
shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-
distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for
anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
As a result of the implementation of the revenue recognition guidance adopted  in the first quarter of 2018, which did not have a
material impact on our accounting policies, we recorded an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018 of $137 million  to beginning
retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending that our customers and independent bottlers expect to be entitled to in line with
revenue recognition . In addition, starting in 2018, we excluded from net reven ue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and
certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions. The impact of these taxes previously
recognized in net revenue and cost of sales was approximately $75 million  for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, with no
impact on operating profit.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estima te and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility , write-of f
history , the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general
and administrative expenses on our income statement.
82
Table of Contents
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. In 2019 , sales to Walmart and its
affiliates (including Sam’ s) represent ed approx imately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, inclu ding concentrate sales to our
independent bottlers , which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these
customers.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending
includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily
accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers  for performing activities on our behalf, such as
payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote
lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of
advertising and other marketing activities.
A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers  and customer volume rebates, are based on annual
targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year
end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and
require management  judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences
between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such
differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized
during the year as incurred.
The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term
estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers
under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue,
and the remaining balances of $272 million  as of December 28, 2019  and $218 million  as of December 29, 2018  are includ ed in
prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.
For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our
interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted
sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’ s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our
forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes
in estimate s and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginn ing in the interim period that they are identified. In
addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing
activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology .
Advertising and other marketing activit ies, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.7 billion  in 2019 ,
$4.2 billion  in 2018  and $4.1 billion  in 2017 , including  advertising expenses of $3.0 billion  in 2019 , $2.6 billion  in 2018  and $2.4
billion  in 2017 . Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of $55 million  and $47 million  as of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , respectively , are
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.

Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are
reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling  expenses were $10.9 billion  in 2019 , $10.5 billion
in 2018  and $9.9 billion  in 2017 .
Software Costs
We capita lize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be
used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or
obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software
projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in
property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $166 million  in 2019 ,
$204 million  in 2018  and $224 million  in 2017 . Net capitalized software and development costs were $572 million  and $577
million  as of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , respectively .
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as
commitments under  contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments
when a loss is probable and estimable.
Research and Development
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally . Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and
development costs were $711 million , $680 million  and $ 737 million  in 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively , and are reported within
selling, general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using eithe r a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter , or more frequently
if circumstances indicate that the carry ing value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we
determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and
significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessme nt indicates that it is more likely than not that an
impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefi nite lived-intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair
value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively . Estimated fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions
underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management
judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeco nomic and other factors to estimate future levels of
sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and
goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are
based on the best available market
84
Table of Contents
information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely
impact our results.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 4 for further information.
Other Significant Accounting Policies
Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:
•Basis of Presentation  – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and
consolidation.
•Property , Plant and Equipment – Note 4.
•Income T axes – Note 5.
•Share-Based Compensation –  Note 6.
•Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans  – Note 7.
•Financial Instruments  – Note 9.
•Cash Equivalents  – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
•Inventories – Note 15. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value . Cost is determined using the
average; first-in, first-out (FIFO) or , in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods.
•Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries  – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for
revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted
In 2018, the Financi al Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification
of the residual tax effects, arising from the change in corporate tax rate, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained
earnings. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the
historical U.S. federal tax rate that rema ins in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the
amount that would have been recorded  using the newly enacted rate. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of
2019; however , we did not elect to make the optional reclassification.
In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the
economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial
and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately
measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this
guidance, certain of our derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting
treatment can now qualify prospectively . We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2019; the adoption did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018 . The guidance requires lessees to recognize most
leases on the balance sheet, but does not change the manner in which expenses are recorded
85
Table of Contents
in the income statem ent. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct
financing leases. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transition approach,
which requires application of the guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach,
which requires prospective application at the adoption date.
We utilized a compr ehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio
from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We completed our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio, including significant
leases by geography  and by asset type that were impacted by the new guidance, and enhanced our controls. In addition, we
implemented a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering our leases and facilitating compliance with
the new guidance.
We adopted the guidance prospectively during the first quarter of 2019. As part of our adoption, we elected not to reassess
historical lease classification, recognize short-term leases on our balance sheet, nor separate lease and non-lease components for
our real estate lease s. In addition, we utilized the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics and did not use
hindsight to determine lease term. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, resulting
in an increase of 2% to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and had an immaterial increase to retained
earnings as of the beginning of 2019. See Note 13 for further information.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Y et Adopted
In 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1)
recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity metho d of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step–up in the tax
basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all the effects of a change in tax law
in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in
the incom e tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is
effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our
consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. For
our trade, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments, we will be required to use a new forward-looking
expected credit loss model that will replace the existing incurred credit loss model, which would generally result in earlier
recognition of allowances for credit losses. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2020. The
guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

2019 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to
further simplify , harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying
the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.  In
connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion  and cash expenditures of approximately
$1.6 billion . These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70% of severance and other employee-related costs,
15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15% for other costs associated with
the implementation of our initiatives. W e expect to complete this plan by 2023.

2014 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, included the next generation of productivity initiatives that
we believ ed would strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing
automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-
engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization
structures to drive efficiency . To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the
plan throu gh the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above that further
strengthened our beverage, food and snack businesses.
The 2014 Productivi ty Plan was comple ted in 2019. In 2019, there were no material pre-tax charges related to this plan and all cash
payments were paid at year end. The total plan pre-ta x charges and cash expenditures approximated the previou sly disclosed plan
estimates of $1.3 billion  and $960 million , respectively . These total plan pre-tax charges consisted of 59% of severance and other
employee costs, 15% of asset impairments and 26% of other costs, including costs associated with the implementation of our
initiatives, including certain consulting and other contract termination costs. These total plan pre-tax charges were incurred by
division as follows: FLNA 14%, QFNA 3%, PBNA 29%, LatAm 15%, Europe 23%, AMESA 3%, APAC 3% and Corporate 10%.

Five-year projected amortization $ 82 $ 80 $ 77 $ 75 $ 74
Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written
down to its estimat ed fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to
determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018  and
December 30, 2017 . We did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the
years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018  and December 30, 2017 . As of December 28, 2019 , the estimated fair values
of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However , there
could be an
90
Table of Contents
impairment of the carrying value of PBNA ’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the
operating results of PBNA ’s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in
a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the
macroeconomic conditions in Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in these
countries and have concluded that there  were no impairments for the year ende d December 28, 2019 . However , there could be an
impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in these countries, includ ing juice and dairy brands in Russia, if there is a
deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected
future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that
do not perform consistent with our expe ctations, or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average
cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.

U.S. Federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 %
State income tax, net of U.S. Federal tax benefit 1.6  0.5  0.9

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. 
In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recordi ng of provisional tax expense using a measurement
period, not to excee d one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act is not
available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act
when it became ef fective in the fourth quarter of 2017.
As a resul t of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion  ($1.70  per share ) in the
fourth quarter of 2017.  Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion  recog nized in 2017, was a provisional mandatory
one-time transition tax of approximate ly $4 billion  on undis tributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This
provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially of fset by a provisional $1.5 billion  benefit resulting from the required
93
Table of Contents
remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018.
The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act, and
reflected in our provision for income taxes.
The provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, in 2018, we recognized a
net tax benefit of $28 million  ($0.02  per share) related to the TCJ Act, primarily reflecting the impact of the final analysis of certain
foreign exchange gains or losses, subst antiation of foreign tax credits, as well as cash and cash equivalents as of November 30,
2018, the tax year-end of our foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by additional  transition tax guidance issued by the United States
Department of Treasury , as well as the TCJ Act impact of both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution
with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, each discussed below .
While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS
impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recogni zed a net tax benefit
totaling $8 million  ($0.01  per share) related to the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the
first quarter of 2019 and adjustments related to the filing of our 2018 U.S. federal tax return.  
As of December 28, 2019 , our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.3 billion , which must be paid through 2026 under the
provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $663 million  in
2019 and $150 million  in 2018. W e currently expect to pay approximately $0.1 billion  of this liability in 2020 .
The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax
income (GIL TI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder . The FASB allows an accounting policy election of
either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes
as a current-period expense when incurr ed. During the first quarter of 2018, we elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-
period expense when incurred.
Other T ax Matters
On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain
provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes.  During 2019 , we recorded net tax expense of $24
million  related to the impact of the TRAF . Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to
result in adjustments to our consolidate d financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the
TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our
business and financial results.
In 2018, we reorganized certain of our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As
a result, we recogniz ed other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion  ($3.05  per share) in 2018. The related deferred  tax asset of $4.4 billion
is being amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally , the reorganization generated significant net operating
loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized, resulting in the recording of a full valuation
allowance.

Reserves
A number  of years may elapse before a particular matter , for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved.
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related
open tax audits are as follows:
Jurisdiction  Years Open to Audit  Years Currently Under
Audit
United States  2014-2018  2014-2016
Mexico  2017-2018  None

In 2018, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $364 million  ($0.26  per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain
international tax audits. Additionally , in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $353 million  ($0.24  per share)  as a result of
our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits
95
Table of Contents
of taxable years 2012 and 2013, includ ing the associated state impact. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the
resolution with the IRS, collectively , resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $717 million  ($0.50  per share) in 2018.
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax plann ing strategies and transactions, including transfer
pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in
determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We estab lish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax
return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed.
We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax
audit, new tax laws or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable
resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.
As of December 28, 2019 , the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.4 billion . We
accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income  taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $250 million  as
of December 28, 2019 , of which $84 million  of tax expense was recognized in 2019 . The gross amount of interest accrued, reported
in other liabilities, was $179 million  as of December 29, 2018 , of which $64 million  of tax benefit was recognized in 2018 .
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Carryforwards and Allowances
Operating loss carryforwards totaling $24.7 billion  at year-end 2019  are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state
jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating
losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion  in 2020 , $20.3 billion  between 2021  and 2039 and $4.2 billion  may be carried forward
indefinitely . We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
In 2018, we repatriated $20.4 billion  of cash, cash equiv alents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsid iaries without
such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability , related to the TCJ Act. As of December 28, 2019 , we had
approximately $6 billion  of undistr ibuted international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $6 billion  of earnings outside the
United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax
expense, no deferred  tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes
or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these
reinvested international earnings.

Note 6 — Shar e-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with
the interes ts of our shareholders. Peps iCo has granted stock options, RSUs , PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to
employees under the shareholder -approv ed PepsiCo, Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term
incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a
combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise
been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-
term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance tar gets.
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and
the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits.
As of December 28, 2019 , 59 million  shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the L TIP.
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense and excess tax benefits recognized:
 2019  2018  2017

(a) Primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
(b) Reflects tax rates ef fective for the 2017 tax year .
As of December 28, 2019 , there was $284 million  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two
years .
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years . Awards to
employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the
date that the employ ee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we
use histori cal data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected
to vest.
We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively . Repricing of awards would require
shareholder approval under the L TIP.
Stock Options
A stock option perm its the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock  at a specified price. We account for our employee
stock options under the fair value metho d of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at
the date of grant. All stock option grant s have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant and generally have a 10-year term.
97
Table of Contents
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:
2019  2018  2017
Expected life 5 years  5 years  5 years
Risk-free interest rate 2.4% 2.6% 2.0%
Expected volatility 14% 12% 11%
Expected dividend yield 3.1% 2.7% 2.7%
The expec ted life is the period over which our employee groups are expected  to hold their options. It is based on our historical
experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.
Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historica l period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend
yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and
stock price.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiC o common stock when the award vests at the end
of the service period . PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of
the service period based on PepsiCo’ s performance against specified financial and/or operational performance metrics. The number
of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance
metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue
dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.
The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant.

PEPunits
PEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in
PepsiCo’ s absolute stock price as well as PepsiCo’ s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three-year
performance period.
The fair value of PEPunits is measured using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which incorporates into the fair-value
determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, until actual performance is determined.
PEPunits were last granted in 2015 and all 248,000  units outstanding at December 30, 2017, with a weighted average grant date fair
value of $68.94 , were converted to 278,000  shares in 2018.
Long-T erm Cash
Certain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term  cash awards for which final payout is based on
PepsiCo’ s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer companies  and achievement of a specified performance target
over a three-year performance period.
Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the
performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model.

Note 7 — Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans
In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and
administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220
million  ($170 million  after -tax or $0.12  per share).
100
Table of Contents
Also in 2019, certai n former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option
of receivin g a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’ s pension benefit. This transaction triggered
a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million  ($41 million  after-tax or $0.03  per share). Collectively , the group annuity
contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in
2019 of $273 million  ($211 million  after -tax or $0.15  per share).
Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were  reorganized into Plan A and Plan I. Actuarial gains
and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining  service life of the active participants, while the
actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a
result of this change, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million  ($27 million  after-tax, reflecting tax rates
effective for the 2017 tax year , or $ 0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual
return on plan assets and the expected  return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each
measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If
this net accumulated  gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-rela ted value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a portion
of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon
the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years ) and retiree medica l (approximately 8 years ),
or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 23 years ). The cost or benefit of plan changes that
increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical
benefits (expense)/i ncome on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A or the
remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I.

The net (gain)/loss arising in the current year is attributed to the change in disco unt rate, primarily offset by the actual asset returns
different from expected returns.
The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the
102
Table of Contents
value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year .
The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will
be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•Amortization of prior service cost/(cred it) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting
from plan amendments.
•Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related
projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due
to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are
irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for project ed benefit obligations. Curtailments are due
to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment
losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailme nt gains are recognized when an event has
occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
•Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as
restructuring.

Of the total projecte d pension benefit liability as of December 28, 2019 , approximately $847 million  relates to plans that we do not
fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.
Future Benefit Payments
Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 - 2029
Pension $ 945 $ 915 $ 900 $ 930 $ 970 $ 5,275
Retiree medical (a)$ 100 $ 95 $ 95 $ 90 $ 85 $ 355
(a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expe cted to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are
expected to be approximately $ 2 million  for each of the years from 2020  through 2024  and approximately $4 million  in total for 2025 through 2029.
These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.
Funding
Contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows:
 Pension  Retiree Medical
 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017
Discretionary (a)$ 417 $ 1,417 $ 6 $ — $ 37 $ —

Total $ 672 $ 1,615 $ 164 $ 44 $ 93 $ 56
(a) Includes $400 million  contribution in 2019 and $1.4 billion  contribution in 2018 to fund Plan A in the United States.
104
Table of Contents
In January 2020 , we made discretionary contributions of $150 million  to Plan A in the United States. In addition, in 2020 , we
expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $150 million  to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans
and approximately $60 million  for retiree medical benefits.
We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.
Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction
with plan liabilities , an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This
strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are
available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Asse ts contributed to our pension plans are no longer
controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. Howe ver, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these
plan assets  as compared to changes in our projected liabilities. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a
well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our
investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and
foreign currency risks. Futures contract s represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified
price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
For 2020  and 2019 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.8%  and 7.1% , respectively . Our target investment
allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:
 2020 2019
Fixed income 50% 47%
U.S. equity 25% 29%
International equity 21% 20%
Real estate 4% 4%
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly
review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset
class, takin g into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels
of interest  rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions
annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for
fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes
investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over
a five-year period. This has the ef fect of reducing year -to-year volatility .

Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan
is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for certain
employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.
Certain U.S. salaried  employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined  benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an
employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , our total Company contributions were $197 million , $180 million  and $176 million , respectively .

(b) These notes, issued in euros, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign
subsidiaries.
The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for gener al corporate purposes, including the repayment of
commercial paper , except for an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our 2.875%  senior notes due 2049 that will be used to
fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects in the categories of investments in sustainable plastics and packaging,
decarbonizing our operations and supp ly chain and water sustainability , whic h promote our selected Sustainable Development
Goals, as defined by the United Nations.
In 2019, we entered into a new five-ye ar unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Y ear Credit Agreement) which expires on
June 3, 2024. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion  in U.S.
dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion  swing line subfacili ty for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on
a same-da y basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased
up to $4.5 billion  (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally , we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an
additional one-year period.
In 2019, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June
1, 2020. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion  in U.S. dollars
and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up
to $4.5 billion  (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or
convert any amount s outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary
of the then effective termination date. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced
our $3.75 billion  five-year credit agreement and our $3.75 billion  364-day credit agreement, both dated as of June 4, 2018. Funds
borrowed under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.
Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow , prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 28, 2019 ,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.
In 2019, we entered into two unsecu red bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) which together enable one of our
consolidated subsid iaries to borrow up to 25.0 billion  South African rand, or approximately $1.8 billion , to provide potential
funding for our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. Each facility is available from the date the conditions precedent are met for the
acquisition up through July 30, 2020 in the case of one facility and July 31, 2020 in the case of the other facility . Borrowings under
the faciliti es are for up to one year once drawn and can be prepaid at any time. Interest rates are reset either every one month or
three months. As of December 28, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Loan Facilities.
In 2019, we paid $1.0 billion  to redeem all $1.0 billion  outstanding principal amount of our 4.50%  senior notes due 2020.

Note 9 — Financial Instruments
Derivatives and Hedging
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the
identification and effective implementat ion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives.
Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain
derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not
qualify and are mark ed to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifyin g hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’ s
fair value to offset corresponding chang es in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings.
Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorde d in accumulated other comprehensive loss and
reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged
transaction will not occur , we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses
reclassified during the year ended December 28, 2019 were not material.
109
Table of Contents
Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchan ge or interest rate risks are classified as operating
activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the
underlying hedged item.
We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk
regularly , including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential
nonperformance of the counterparty . Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to
be low. In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in
order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability
position if our credi t rating is at A2 (Moody’ s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on
credit watc h for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on December 28, 2019 was $415 million . We have  posted
no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 28, 2019.
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased  costs through higher pricing may be limited in the
competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,
pricing agreements and derivative instru ments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain
raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more
than three years , to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for energy,
agricultural product s and metals . Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either
cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are
subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion  as of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 .
Foreign Exchange
We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or
sold. Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency
purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing
purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives,
primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years . Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency
transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statem ent as incurred. We also use net investment hedges
to partially of fset the ef fects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion  as of December 28, 2019  and $2.0 billion  as of
December 29, 2018 . The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investmen t hedges was $2.5 billion  as of
December 28, 2019  and $0.9 billion  as of December 29, 2018 . For foreign curren cy derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact

Inter est Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investm ent opportunities and risks, tax consequences and
overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instrument s including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps,
cross-currency interest rate swaps, T reasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.
These instruments ef fectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness
have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-
currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest
rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years . Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against
unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $5.0 billion  as of December 28, 2019  and $10.5 billion  as of December 29,
2018 .
As of December 28, 2019 , approximately 9% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was
subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 29% as of December 29, 2018 .
Available-for-Sale Securities
Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for -sale. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our investments in available -for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for -sale debt securities are recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity . Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in debt securities as
of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018  were  not material. Changes in the fair value of available-for -sale debt securi ties
impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other -than-temporar y impairment is recognized. We recorded no other -
than-temporary impa irment charges on our available-for -sale debt securities for the years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29,
2018  and December 30, 2017 .
In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million  ($85 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share), net of discount and fees, associated
with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic. The gain on the sale of this equity investment was recorded in our Europe segment in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Note 13 — Leases
Lessee
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers,
storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have
remaining lease terms of up to 20 years , some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years , and some of
which include options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these  options in determi ning the lease term used to
establish our right-of-use

assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive
covenants.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease
components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).
Components of lease cost are as follows:
 2019
Operating lease cost (a)$ 474
Variable lease cost (b)$ 101
Short-term lease cost (c)$ 379
(a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $412 million .
(b) Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax.

Note 14 — Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Acquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd.
On July 19, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage
company in South Africa with exports  to countries across the globe , for 110.00  South African rand per share in cash, in a
transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion . Also in 2019, one of our consolidated subsidiaries entered into Bridge Loan
Facilities to provide potential funding for our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 8 for further information.

approximately $3.3 billion  (or $3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acquired).
We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth
quarter of 2019.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , and the related Consolidated Statemen ts of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash
Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2019  and the related notes (collectively ,
the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 ) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financ ial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We condu cted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits  of the consolidated financial  statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
123
Table of Contents
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over finan cial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and direc tors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that
could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critic al audit matters communicate d below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments . The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole,  and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below , providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Evaluation of certain sales incentive accruals
As discuss ed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through
various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentive s are based on annual targets, resulting in the
need to accrue for the expected liability . These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current
liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer
and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.
We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’ s sales incentive accru als as a critical audit matter . Subjective and
complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between
when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and
consumer participati on and performance level assumptions underlying the accru al, and (2) the impact of historical experience
and trends.
The primary procedures that we perfor med to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain
internal controls over the Company’ s sales incentive process, including (1) the accrual methodology , (2) assumptions around
forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred
compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evalu ate the timing and amount of certain accrued
sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales
incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, based on
volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’ s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive
accrual by comparing previously established accruals
124
Table of Contents
to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to
the recorded sales incentive accrual.
Assessment of the carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands
As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and
changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of
indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 28, 2019 was $30.1 billion  which represents 38% of total assets, and
includes PepsiCo Beverages North America’ s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of
$8.6 billion  as of December 28, 2019.
We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA ’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of Europe’ s
juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter . Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of
competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment
analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’ s forecasted
revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates  and the selection of the discount rates to be
applied to the projected cash flows.
The primary procedures that we perfor med to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain
internal controls over the Company’ s indefinite-lived assets impairment process to develop the forecasted revenue,
profitability levels, and expected long- term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash
flows. We also evalu ated the sensitivity of the Company’ s conclusion to change s in assumptions, including the assessment of
changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’ s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the
Company’ s historica l forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests
with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized
skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing
against economic data and informatio n specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross
Domestic Product growth in the respe ctive local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by
comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that
of comparable companies.
Evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits
As discuss ed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’ s global operating model gives rise to income
tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 28, 2019, the
Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion . The Company establishes reserves if it believes that
certain positions taken in its tax returns  are subject to challenge and the Comp any likely will not succeed, even though the
Company believes the tax return positio n is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the
related interest, in light of new inform ation, such as the progress of a tax examination, or new tax law or tax authority
settlements.
We identified the evaluation of the Company’ s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of
tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’ s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such
judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring
liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information.
125
Table of Contents
The primary procedures that we perfor med to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain
internal controls over the Company’ s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income
tax positio ns, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’ s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits,
and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress
of a tax examination , new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized
skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’ s tax structure
and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’ s interpretation of existing tax law
as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, and associated external counsel opinions.

continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year
productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify , harmonize and

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON ST OCK
The following description of our common stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,
effective as of May 1, 2019 (“Articles of Incorporation”), our By‑Laws, as amended and restated, ef fective as of January 1 1, 2016
(“By‑Laws”) and applicable provisions of law . We have summarized certain portions of the Articles of Incorporation and By‑Laws
below . The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By‑Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the
Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. Y ou should read the Articles of Incorporation and By‑Laws for the
provisions that are important to you.
General
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two‑thirds
cents (1‑2/3 cents) per share. As of February 6, 2020 there were 1,389,544,618  shares of common stock outstanding which were
held of record by 109,312  shareholders.
Voting Rights.  Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the
applicable record date on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Action on a matter generally requires that the votes cast
in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors where
the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
Dividend Rights.  Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by
PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor .
Rights Upon Liquidation.  Holders of our common stock are entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of PepsiCo, in all remaining assets available for distribution to shareholders after payment or providing for PepsiCo’ s
liabilities.
Preemptive Rights.  Holders of our common stock do not have the right to subscribe for , purchase or receive new or
additional common stock or other securities.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Computershare T rust Company , N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.
Stock Exchange Listing
The Nasdaq Global Select Market is the principal market for our common stock, where it is listed under the symbol “PEP ,”
and our common stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.
Certain Pr ovisions of PepsiCo’ s Articles of Incorporation and By‑Laws; Dir ector Indemnification Agr eements
Advance Notice of Pr oposals and Nominations.  Our By‑Laws provide that shareholders must provide timely written notice
to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting
of shareholders. Notice for an annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal of fice not less than 90 days nor
more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year ’s annual meeting. However , if the date of the annual meeting
is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the
preceding year , such notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and not
later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which
public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. Shareholders utilizing “proxy access” must meet separate
deadlines. The By‑Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder ’s notice. These provisions may prevent shareholders
from bringing matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or from nominating candidates for election as directors at an
annual meeting of shareholders.
Proxy Access.  Our By‑Laws contain “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareholder (or a group of up to 20
shareholders aggregating their shares) that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least three
years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable annual
general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of our
By‑Laws.
Special Meetings.  A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the
Board or by our corporate secretary upon written request of
2
one or more shareholders holding shares of record representing at least 20% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock
entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at the request of our shareholders will be held at such date, time
and place as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the date of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the
receipt of such request by the corporate secretary . The By‑Laws specify the form and content of a shareholder ’s request for a
special meeting.
Indemnification of Dir ectors, Officers and Employees.  Our By‑Laws provide that unless the Board determines otherwise,
we shall indemnify , to the full extent permitted by law , any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an
action, suit or proceeding (including appeals), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the
fact that such person, such person’ s testator or intestate, is or was one of our directors, of ficers or employees, or is or was serving at
our request as a director , officer or employee of another enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding.
Pursuant to our By‑Laws this indemnification may , at the Board’ s discretion, also include advancement of expenses prior to the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, pursuant to which we
have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law , each director against any and all liabilities and
assessments (including attorneys’ fees and other costs, expenses and obligations) arising out of or related to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or other , including,
but not limited to, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval), and any
interest, assessments, excise taxes or other char ges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any of the foregoing,
incurred by the independent director and arising out of his status as a director or member of a committee of our Board, or by reason
of anything done or not done by the director in such capacities. After receipt of an appropriate request by an independent director ,
we will also advance all expenses, costs and other obligations (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to such matters.
We will not be liable for payment of any liability or expense incurred by an independent director on account of acts which, at the
time taken, were known or believed by such director to be clearly in conflict with our best interests.
Certain Anti‑T akeover Effects of North Car olina Law
The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act generally requires the af firmative vote of 95% of a public corporation’ s
voting shares to approve a “business combination” with any entity that a majority of continuing directors determines beneficially
owns, directly or indirectly , more than 20% of the voting shares of the corporation (or ever owned, directly or indirectly , more than
20% and is still an “af filiate” of the corporation) unless the fair price provisions and the procedural provisions of the North
Carolina Shareholder Protection Act are satisfied.
“Business combination” is defined by the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act as (i) any mer ger, consolidation or
conversion of a corporation with or into any other entity , or
3
(ii) any sale or lease of all or any substantial part of the corporation’ s assets to any other entity , or (iii) any payment, sale or lease to
the corporation or any subsidiary thereof in exchange for securities of the corporation of any assets having an aggregate fair market
value equal to or greater than $5,000,000 of any other entity .
The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act contains provisions that allowed a corporation to “opt out” of the
applicability of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act’ s voting provisions within specified time periods that generally have
expired. The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.
This statute could discourage a third party from making a partial tender of fer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial
position in our equity securities or seeking to obtain control of us. It also might limit the price that certain investors might be
willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock and may have the ef fect of delaying or preventing a change of control
of us.
DESCRIPTION OF NOTES
We have previously filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-177307), which was filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 13, 201 1 and covers the issuance of the sterling notes, 2021 notes and 2026

February 15, 2017 and covers the issuance of the 2027 notes, 2031 notes and 2039 notes.
The notes were issued under an indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 between us and The Bank of New Y ork Mellon, as
trustee (the “indenture”). Below we have summarized certain terms and provisions of the indenture. The summary is not complete.
The indenture has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part.
You should read the indenture for the provisions which may be important to you. The indenture is subject to and governed by the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

Additional Notes . We may , without the consent of the existing holders of the notes of a series, issue additional notes of such
series having the same terms (except issue date, date from which interest accrues and, in some cases, the first interest payment date)
so that the existing notes of such series and the new notes of such series form a single series under the indenture. As of February 6,
2020, no such additional notes have been issued.
5
Minimum Denominations . The sterling notes were issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of
£1,000 in excess thereof. The euro notes were issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.
Global Notes . The notes of each series are in the form of one or more global notes that we deposited with or on behalf of a
common depositary for the accounts of  Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V ., or its successor , as operator of the Euroclear System
(“Euroclear”)  and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme  (“Clearstream”) and are registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary .
Paying Agent . We have initially appointed The Bank of New Y ork Mellon, London Branch to act as paying agent and
transfer agent in connection with the notes as well as to serve as the common depositary for the notes. The Bank of New Y ork
Mellon, London Branch is an af filiate of the trustee. The term “paying agent” shall include The Bank of New Y ork Mellon, London
Branch and any successors appointed from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the indenture.
Curr ency of Payment of Sterling Notes . The principal and interest payments in respect of the sterling notes are payable in
sterling. If the United Kingdom adopts euro, in lieu of sterling, as its lawful currency , the sterling notes will be redenominated in
euro on a date determined by us, in our sole discretion, with a principal amount for each sterling note equal to the principal amount
of that note in sterling, converted into euro at the rate established by the applicable law; provided that, if we determine after
consultation with the paying agent that the then current market practice in respect of redenomination into euro of internationally
offered securities is dif ferent from the provisions specified above, such provisions will be deemed to be amended so as to comply
with such market practice and we will promptly notify the trustee and the paying agent of such deemed amendment. W e will give
30 days’ notice of the redenomination date to the paying agent, the trustee, Euroclear and Clearstream.
If sterling or , in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of
exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control (other than, with respect to sterling, due to the circumstances
described in the preceding paragraph but including the dissolution of the euro, if applicable), then all payments in respect of the
sterling notes will be made in U.S. dollars until sterling or euro, as the case may be, is again available to us. The amount payable on
any date in sterling or , in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro will be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis
of the then most recently available market exchange rate for sterling or euro, as the case may be, as determined by us in our sole
discretion. Any payment in respect of the sterling notes so made in euro or U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under
the sterling notes or the indenture governing the sterling notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall be responsible for
obtaining exchange rates, ef fecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.
Curr ency of Payment of Eur o Notes . The principal and interest payments in respect of the euro notes, including payments
made upon any redemption of any series of the euro notes, are payable in euro. If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition
of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then
6
member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by
public institutions of or within the international banking community , then all payments in respect of the euro notes will be made in
U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us and so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will
be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for euro, as determined by us in
our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the euro notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under
the euro notes or the indenture governing the euro notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for
any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.
Definition of Business Day . The term “business day” with respect to the sterling notes means any day other than a Saturday
or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New Y ork or the City of London are authorized or required by law
or executive order to close.
The term “business day” with respect to the euro notes means any day , other than a Saturday or Sunday , (1) which is not a
day on which banking institutions in the City of New Y ork or the City of London are authorized or required by law or executive
order to close and (2) on which the T rans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express T ransfer system (the
TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. If any interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date is not a
business day , then the related payment for such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date shall be paid on the next
succeeding business day with the same force and ef fect as if made on such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date,
as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay .
Inter est Payments . Interest on the notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which
interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue for the
period to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL
(ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Markets Association.
Optional Redemption
Sterling Notes
We have the right at our option to redeem any of the sterling notes in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time prior
to their maturity , on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed (or otherwise transmitted in accordance with
the procedures of the depositary) to the registered address of each holder of the sterling notes, at a redemption price (calculated by
us) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining
Scheduled Payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the
redemption date on a semi-annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the Comparable Government Bond Rate plus 13 basis
points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption.
7
Definitions
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, 0.0005
being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the sterling notes, if they were to be purchased at such price on the
third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the
Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond
prevailing at 1 1:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the
discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a United Kingdom government bond whose maturity is closest to the
maturity of the sterling notes, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion considers that such similar bond is not in
issue, such other United Kingdom government bond as such independent investment bank may , with the advice of three brokers of,
and/or market makers in, United Kingdom government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each sterling note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled
payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption;
provided, however , that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such sterling note, the amount of the
next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such
redemption date.

Definitions
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date for each series of euro notes, the price,
expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption
yield on such euro notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date fixed
for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond (as
defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 1 1:00 a.m. (London
time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, with respect to each series of euro notes, in relation to any Comparable
Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German government
bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the euro notes to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its
discretion considers that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment
bank may , with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be
appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each euro note of each series to be redeemed, the remaining
scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such
redemption; provided, however , that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such euro note, the
amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued
thereon to such redemption date.

General
On and after the applicable redemption date with respect to a series of notes, interest will cease to accrue on such notes or
any portion of such notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On
or before the redemption date, we will deposit with the trustee or its agent money suf ficient to pay the redemption price of and
(unless the redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date on the notes to be
redeemed on such date. If less than all of the notes of a series are to be redeemed, the notes of such series to be redeemed shall be
selected in accordance with applicable depositary procedures. Additionally , we may at any time repurchase notes in the open
market and may hold or surrender such notes to the trustee for cancellation.
Notice of redemption will be transmitted at least 30 days (or 15 days with respect to the 2039 notes) but not more than 60
days before the applicable redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed. W e will be responsible for calculating the
redemption price of the notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

upon such incurrence, to secure the notes equally and ratably with such secured debt.
Consolidation, Mer ger or Sale of Assets
We may consolidate or mer ge with or into, or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to, any entity

lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, will have happened and be continuing; and

complies with the indenture.
In the event of any such consolidation, mer ger, conveyance, transfer or lease, any such successor will succeed to and be

released from all obligations under the indenture and under the notes.

19
Events of Default
An “Event of Default” under the notes of a given series means:
(1) default in paying interest on the notes when it becomes due and the default continues for a period of 30 days or
more;
(2)    default in paying principal, or premium, if any , on the notes when due;
(3) default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or analogous obligation when the same becomes
due, and such default continues for 30 days or more;
(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of PepsiCo in the indenture (other than defaults
specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above) and the default or breach continues for a period of 90 days or more after we
receive written notice from the trustee or we and the trustee receive notice from the holders of at least 51% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series;
(5) certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency , reor ganization, administration or similar proceedings with respect to
PepsiCo have occurred; or
(6)    any other Events of Default set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo) under the indenture
occurs with respect to the notes of any series and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 51% in principal amount of
the outstanding notes of that series may by written notice require us to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the
outstanding notes of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes), together with all accrued and
unpaid interest and premium, if any .
If an Event of Default under the indenture specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo occurs and is continuing, then the
entire principal amount of the outstanding notes (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes) will
automatically become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder .
After a declaration of acceleration, the holders of not less than 51% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes of
any series may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing Events of Default, except for nonpayment of the
principal and interest on the notes of that series that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement, have
been cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not conflict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series also have the right to waive past defaults, except a default in
paying principal, premium or interest on any outstanding note, or in respect of a covenant or a provision that cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of all holders of the notes of that series.
20
Holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a series may seek to institute a proceeding only after
they have notified the trustee of a continuing Event of Default in writing and made a written request, and of fered reasonable
indemnity , to the trustee to institute a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60 days after it received this notice. In
addition, within this 60 day period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request by holders of
a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series. These limitations do not apply , however , to a suit instituted by
a holder of a note for the enforcement of the payment of principal, interest or any premium on or after the due dates for such
payment.
During the existence of an Event of Default, the trustee is required to exercise the rights and powers vested in it under the
indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would under the circumstances in the conduct
of that person’ s own af fairs. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee is not under any obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have of fered to the trustee
reasonable security or indemnity . Subject to certain provisions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
notes of any series have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
trustee, or exercising any trust, or power conferred on the trustee.
The trustee will, within 90 days after any default occurs, give notice of the default to the holders of the notes of that series,
unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless there is a default in paying principal, interest or any premium when due, the
trustee can withhold giving notice to the holders if it determines in good faith that the withholding of notice is in the interest of the
holders.

The indenture may be amended or modified without the consent of any holder of notes in order to:
•evidence a succession to the trustee;

•adversely af fect the ranking of the notes of any series; or
•release any guarantor from any of its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture, except in compliance with the terms
of the indenture.
Satisfaction, Discharge and Covenant Defeasance
We may terminate our obligations under the indenture, when:
•either:
•all the notes of any series issued that have been authenticated and delivered have been delivered to the trustee for
cancellation; or
•all the notes of any series issued that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable, will become due and payable within one year , or are to be called for redemption within
one year and we have made arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by such trustee in our name and at our expense, and in each case, we have
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee suf ficient funds to pay and
dischar ge the entire indebtedness on the series of notes to pay principal, interest and any
premium; and
22
•we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums then due and payable under the indenture; and
•we have delivered to the trustee an of ficers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent
under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and dischar ge of the indenture have been complied with.
We may elect to have our obligations under the indenture dischar ged with respect to the outstanding notes of any series
(“legal defeasance”). Legal defeasance means that we will be deemed to have paid and dischar ged the entire indebtedness
represented by the outstanding notes of such series under the indenture, except for:
•the rights of holders of the notes to receive principal, interest and any premium when due;
•our obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of transfer of the notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an of fice or agency for payment for security payments
held in trust;
•the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and
•the defeasance provisions of the indenture.
In addition, we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certain covenants in the indenture (“covenant
defeasance”). Any omission to comply with these obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the
notes of any series. In the event covenant defeasance occurs, certain events, not including non‑payment, bankruptcy and insolvency
events, described under “Events of Default” above will no longer constitute an event of default for that series.
In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to outstanding notes of any series:
•we must irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds for the purpose of making the
following payments, specifically pledged as security for , and dedicated solely to the benefit of the holders of the
notes of a series:
•money in an amount;
•U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations in the case of notes denominated in other than
U.S. dollars or a specified currency) that will provide, not later than one day before the due date
of any payment, money in an amount; or
•a combination of money and U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations, as applicable),
in each case suf ficient, in the written opinion (with respect to U.S. or equivalent government obligations or a
combination of money and U.S. or equivalent
23
government obligations, as applicable) of a nationally recognized firm of independent registered public accountants, to
pay and dischar ge, and which shall be applied by the trustee to pay and dischar ge, all of the principal (including
mandatory sinking fund payments), interest and any premium at the due date or maturity;
•in the case of legal defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that, under then
applicable federal income tax law , the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss
for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and dischar ge to be ef fected and will be
subject to the same federal income tax as would be the case if the deposit, defeasance and dischar ge did not
occur;
•in the case of covenant defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the ef fect that the
holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of the deposit and covenant defeasance to be ef fected and will be subject to the same federal income
tax as would be the case if the deposit and covenant defeasance did not occur;
•no event of default or default with respect to the outstanding notes of that series has occurred and is continuing at the time
of such deposit after giving ef fect to the deposit or , in the case of legal defeasance, no default relating to
bankruptcy or insolvency has occurred and is continuing at any time on or before the 91st day after the date of
such deposit, it being understood that this condition is not deemed satisfied until after the 91st day;
•the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of
the T rust Indenture Act, assuming all notes of a series were in default within the meaning of such Act;
•the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under , any
other agreement or instrument to which we are a party;
•the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment
company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless the trust is registered
under such Act or exempt from registration; and
•we must have delivered to the trustee an of ficers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent
with respect to the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with.
Book-Entry , Delivery and Settlement
We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and
procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. W e take
24
no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section
reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in ef fect. Those clearing
systems could change their rules and procedures at any time.
The notes of each series were initially represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note was
deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear . Except as set forth below , the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part,
only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. Y ou may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe through
Clearstream or Euroclear , either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through or ganizations which are participants in such
systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating or ganizations
or customers through customers’ securities accounts in Clearstream’ s or Euroclear ’s names on the books of their respective
depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes will be reflected in the book-entry records of
Clearstream and Euroclear . The address of Clearstream is 42 A venue JF Kennedy , L-1855 Luxembour g, Luxembour g and the
address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.
The distribution of the notes was cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear . Any secondary market trading of book-entry
interests in the notes will take place through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and will settle in same-day funds. Owners of
book-entry interests in the notes will receive payments relating to their notes in sterling with respect to the sterling notes and euro
with respect to the euro notes, except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer , processing, depositary and custodial
links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the notes to be issued,
held and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to facilitate
clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the secondary
market.
The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the investor ’s
interest in the notes held by them. W e have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear or any
of their direct or indirect participants. W e also do not supervise these systems in any way .
Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they
have made with one another or with their customers. Y ou should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to
perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.
Except as provided otherwise, owners of beneficial interests in the notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in
their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive
25
physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indenture,
including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to the indenture. Accordingly , each person
owning a beneficial interest in a note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the
procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes.
Certificated Notes . Subject to certain conditions, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated
notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in
excess thereof with respect to the sterling notes and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof
with respect to the euro notes if:
(1)the common depositary provides notification that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary
for the global notes and a successor is not appointed within 90 days;
(2)we in our discretion at any time determine not to have all the notes of any series represented by the global note; or
(3)default entitling the holders of the applicable notes of any series to accelerate the maturity thereof has occurred and is
continuing.
Any note of any series that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes of such series issuable in
authorized denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global
note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the common
depositary (or its nominee).
Same-day Payment . Payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) and transfers with respect to notes
of any series in certificated form may be executed at the of fice or agency maintained for such purpose within the City of London
(initially the of fice of the paying agent maintained for such purpose) or , at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the
respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the applicable notes of such series, provided that all payments (including
principal, interest and any additional amounts) on notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer
instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders
thereof. No service char ge will be made for any registration of transfer , but payment of a sum suf ficient to cover any tax or
governmental char ge payable in connection with that registration may be required.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
ARTICLE I
Foreword
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the
benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried Employees
Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the
Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP
provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.
1989 Document . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety ef fective as of January 1, 1989. The
provisions of the Plan in ef fect prior to January 1, 1989 govern the rights and benefits of employees whose Credited
Service ended before that date (and as necessary , before the ef fective date of any provision with a dif ferent pre-1989
effective date).
2005 Document . This document (the “Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document”) was first ef fective as of
January 1, 2005 (the “Ef fective Date”) and was restated to reflect amendments through December 31, 2008. It
generally retained without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement. However , it was clarified to reflect that it
set forth the terms of the Plan applicable to benefits that were grandfathered under Section 409A, i.e., generally ,
benefits that were both earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 (the “Pre-409A Program”).
2016 Restatement . This restatement of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document is ef fective as of April 1,
2016. There have been no material modifications made to the Pre-409A
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
PepsiCo PEP Document as a result of the 2016 restatement. The Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document continues
generally to retain without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement.
This restatement reflects amendments through April 1, 2016, including amendments to reflect the merger
into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on December 31,
2011. The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on October 3, 2004 as amended through January 1, 2011 (“Pre-409A
PBG PEP Document”) and as subsequently amended from time to time is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG
Pre-409A; it continues to govern PBG PEP benefits that were grandfathered under Section 409A and that were subject
to the Pre-409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain administrative provisions now
governed by the main portion of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained in Appendix Article PBG Pre-
409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Section 409A under
either the PepsiCo PEP Program or the PBG PEP Program that would constitute a material modification within the
meaning of T reas. Reg.§ 1.409A-6(a)(4) as a result of the merger or the revisions to the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP
Document and Pre-409A PBG PEP document.
409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are earned or vested after January 1, 1989 shall be
governed by the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program (the “409A Program”). Together , this document (the Pre-
409A PepsiCo PEP Document) and the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program describe the terms of a single
plan.
Preservation of Pre-409A Program Within PEP Plan . This document (the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP
Document) has been modified to clarify (without any material
- 2 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
modification) the integration of the Pre-409A Program with the 409A Program. However , amounts subject to the terms
of this Pre-409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program shall be tracked separately at all
times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation
between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the
Pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A as a program of grandfathered benefits.

ARTICLE II.
Definitions and Construction
2.1    Definitions : This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases. Where the following
words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan with initial capitals they shall have the meaning set
forth below , unless a dif ferent meaning is plainly required by the context.
Accrued Benefit : The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with
Article V , based on the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of
determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the
Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the
factors set forth below . The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable
under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is amended to provide
new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless
specifically adopted by the amendment.
(1) Annuities and Inflation Protection :
(i) Annuity Starting Dates After December 31, 2018 : To determine the amount of a
Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date after December 31, 2018 (A) in the form of a Qualified
Joint and Survivor Annuity or
- 4 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
other form of survivor annuity , (B) as an annuity with inflation protection, or (C) as a period certain and life
annuity or other death benefit annuity , the Plan Administrator shall specify the factors that are to be used.
Effective January 1, 2019, the factors specified by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1
below . Subsequently , the Plan Administrator may specify new factors for these and other forms of
payment, in its sole and absolute discretion, by a resolution adopted by the Plan Administrator . A
Participant’ s benefit under the Pre-409A Program shall be determined under the actuarial factors
specified and in ef fect as of the Annuity Starting Date of the Participant’ s benefit. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of
payment specified by the Plan Administrator may be applied retroactively to previously accrued benefits,
and without regard to the factors that previously applied for such purpose. In particular , in adjusting
benefits under the Plan using the factors in Schedule 1 (below), the right to a benefit that is not less than
would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall not apply (even when, for example, it
would apply under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors). For this purpose, the
phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’ s definition
of “Actuarial Equivalent” ef fective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried Plan) on or
after January 1, 2019. If a Participant elects a survivor , period certain annuity or other death benefit
annuity with inflation protection, Schedule 1(a) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor
benefit, period certain or other death benefit, and Schedule 1(b) or (c)
- 5 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
shall apply solely to adjust for the elected inflation protection (for this purpose and as applies generally
when determining an Actuarial Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from applying these factors from
separate Schedules shall be determined using an actuarial computation method that is reasonable and
applied consistently to similarly situated participants).

(c) Annuity Starting Dates on or After

*As this term is defined in the Salaried Plan’s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent”
(ii) Annuity Starting Dates Before January 1, 2019 : To determine the amount of a
Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date before January 1, 2019, and in the form of a Qualified
Joint and Survivor Annuity or other form of survivor annuity , or as an annuity with inflation protection, the
factors applicable as of such time for such purposes under the Salaried Plan shall apply . However , in
determining a Pre-409A Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date before January 1, 2019, no
change in such factors occurring on or after the Ef fective Date in the basis for determining the amount of
an annuity form of payment from that in ef fect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to the
extent it would result in a larger annuity (but this sentence shall
- 6 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3), relating to the “Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit”).
(2) Lump Sums : To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, or a Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension under Section 4.6, the factors applicable for such purposes under the Salaried Plan
shall apply , except that when the term “PBGC Rate” is used in the Salaried Plan in this context it shall
mean “PBGC Rate” as defined in this Plan. However , in determining a Pre-409A Pension, no amendment,
which is ef fective on or after the Ef fective Date, to the Salaried Plan’ s provisions for determining lump
sums from those in ef fect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent that doing so
is expected to result in a larger lump sum (or in the case of a Salaried Plan amendment that becomes
effective on or after January 1, 2015, a dif ferent lump sum, unless this Pre-409A Program document is
amended to expressly apply the Salaried Plan amendment in determining a Pre-409A Pension), but this
sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3), relating to the “Limit on the Pre-409A Pension
Benefit.” For example, therefore, the Salaried Plan amendment that adopted Pension Protection Act
factors for lump sums ef fective January 1, 2008 is generally taken into account under the Pre-409A
Program, but the Salaried Plan amendment that changed the “lookback period” and “stability period” for
lump sums ef fective January 1, 2015 is not taken account under the Pre-409A Program, except for
purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3).
- 7 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(3) Other Cases : To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or on
behalf of a Participant in other cases (including to reduce a V ested Pension for early commencement), the
factors are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan. However , in determining a Pre-
409A Pension, no change occurring on or after the Ef fective Date in such factors from those in ef fect as of
December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent that it would result in a larger pension (but
this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3), relating to the “Limit on the Pre-409A
Pension Benefit”).
Advance Election : A Participant’ s election to receive his Pre-409A Retirement Pension as a
Single Lump Sum or an Annuity , made in compliance with the requirements of Section 6.3.
Annuity : A Pension payable as a series of monthly payments for at least the life of the Participant.
Annuity Starting Date : The Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the first period for which
an amount is payable under this Plan as an annuity or in any other form. A Participant who: (1) is reemployed
after his initial Annuity Starting Date, and (2) is entitled to benefits hereunder after his reemployment, shall have
a subsequent Annuity Starting Date for such benefits only to the extent provided in Section 6.3(d).
- 8 -

standard personnel practices, whether paid or unpaid.

effect from time to time.
Code : The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. All references herein to
particular Code Sections shall also refer to any successor provisions and shall include all related regulations,

Carolina or its successor or successors.

the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date or the date of the Participant’ s death.

When a Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Post-2004 Participant under this Plan, the amount
of such Pre-409A Pension shall be determined under Section 5.1 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to any
adjustments required under Sections 4.6(b), 5.4 and 5.5. In the case of a Pre-2005 Participant, the amount of such
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension (or a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension payable on his behalf) shall be
determined as provided in Article B of the Appendix.
5.1    Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension
(a) Calculating the Pre-409A Pension:  In the case of a Post-2004 Participant, such Participant’ s
Pre-409A Pension shall be calculated as follows (on the basis specified in subsection (b) below and using the
definitions appearing in subsection (c) below):
(1)     His T otal Pension, reduced by
(2)     His Salaried Plan Pension.
(b) Basis for Determining : The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount in subsection (a) above shall be
the greater of the amount determined on the basis set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) below , but never more than
the limitation specified in paragraph (3) below:
- 32 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(1)    Present V alue Method : The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount under this
paragraph shall be determined initially as a present value of the Participant’ s benefit under subsection (a)
as of December 31, 2004 (determined as if the Participant voluntarily terminated on that date without
cause, received a payment on the earliest possible commencement date (“Earliest Date”) thereafter , and
such payment was in the form with the maximum value available to the Participant in connection with a
termination at such time), using the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum factors in ef fect on such date (“2004
Lump Sum Factors”) to determine the present value. Such present value amount shall then be increased,
if the Participant had not yet attained the Participant’ s Earliest Date as of December 31, 2004, for both
interest and survivorship through such Earliest Date, using the 2004 Lump Sum Factors.
(2)     Accrued Benefit Method : The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount under this
paragraph shall be based on the Participant’ s Accrued Benefit as of December 31, 2004, but with such
Accrued Benefit amount reduced for early commencement (where applicable based on the Participant’ s
actual Annuity Starting Date for his Pre-409A Pension), based upon the reduction factors for early
commencement applicable to the Participant’ s status as eligible for a retirement benefit (under Section
4.2) or a vested benefit (under Section 4.3), whichever applies.
(3)    Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit : Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2)
above, a Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension
- 33 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Benefit amount shall never exceed the Participant’ s Total Pension reduced by his Salaried Plan Pension,
with each calculated as of the actual Annuity Starting Date of Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension. For
purposes of this paragraph (3), the provisions of Article IV that freeze the Participant’ s status as of
December 31, 2004 (or consider only the status on such date), and the provisions of this document that
bar taking into account Plan changes that are ef fective after December 31, 2004 shall not be taken into
account.
(c) Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1) A Participant’ s “Total Pension” means the greater of:
(i) The amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of the
Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the
Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial
adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (relating to benefits that are deferred
beyond the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii) The amount (if any) of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under Section 5.2.
For purposes of subsection (b)(1) and (2), the determination in clause (i) and (ii) above shall be made
(except, in the case of subsection (b)(2), with respect to early commencement reductions, which shall be
made as of the Annuity Starting Date)
- 34 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
as of December 31, 2004, and (except to the extent the provisions of the Plan specifically authorize taking
into account subsequent changes) shall be made on the basis of the terms of the Salaried Plan without
taking into account changes after December 31, 2004. As necessary to ensure the Participant’ s receipt of
a “greater of” benefit, the foregoing comparison between clause (i) and clause (ii) shall be made by
reflecting, as applicable, the relative value of forms of payment.
(2) A Participant’ s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’ s
pension determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan. For purposes of subsection (b)(1) and (2), the
determination of a Participant’ s Salaried Plan Pension shall be made (except, in the case of subsection
(b)(2), with respect to early commencement reductions, which shall be made as of the Annuity Starting
Date) as of December 31, 2004, and (except to the extent the provisions of the Plan specifically authorize
taking into account subsequent changes) shall be made on the basis of the terms of the Salaried Plan
without taking into account changes after December 31, 2004.
5.2    PEP Guarantee : A Post-2004 Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be entitled
to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below . In the case of Participants who are not eligible
under subsection (a), the PEP Guarantee shall not apply .
(a) Eligibility : A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable
earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings”
means the Participant’ s
- 35 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
remuneration for the 1988 calendar year , within the meaning of the Salaried Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988
pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that entity
was not an Employer .
(b) PEP Guarantee Formula : The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined
under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1) Formulas : The amount of a Participant’ s Pension under this paragraph shall be
determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) below . However , if the Participant was actively employed
by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the
amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts determined under
subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of
a Vested Pension.
(i) Formula A : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:
(A) 3 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the
first 10 years of Credited Service, plus
(B) 1 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each
year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
- 36 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(C) 1-2/3 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be
calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he
remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest
Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Severance from Service
Date, and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Participant’ s actual years of Credited Service on his Severance from Service Date (or
December 31, 2004, if earlier) and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he
would have earned had he remained in the employ of an Employer until his Normal Retirement
Age.
(ii)    Formula B : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater of
(A) or (B) below:
(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of
years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount, or
- 37 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(B)    3 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of
years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social
Security Amount.
In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be
calculated on the basis of the Participant’ s Credited Service (determined in accordance with
Section 3.3(d)(3) of the Salaried Plan, as in ef fect on December 31, 2004), and his Highest A verage
Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability (or as of such earlier date
as may apply under Section 5.1(b)).
(2) Calculation : The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to
paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i) Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s Annuity : Subject to subparagraph (iii) below and the
last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an Eligible Spouse, the Participant’ s Eligible
Spouse shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity
under this section, with no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments
to a surviving Eligible Spouse shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the
Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’ s death. If
the Eligible Spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Participant,
- 38 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A) For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible
Spouse is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be
reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B) For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse is
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by an
additional 0.4 percent.
(ii) Reductions : The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s
PEP Guarantee.
(A) If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement Date.
(B) If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall
be reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if
payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b) reductions for any Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s coverage shall apply .
- 39 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(C) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, that is greater
than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this
section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is
the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this
section.
(D) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse. In this instance, the
Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit
payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the
Participant’ s life.
(E) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an Annuity
form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance, the Participant’ s
Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the
Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.
(iii) Lump Sum Conversion : The amount of the Retirement Pension determined under
this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall
be the Actuarial
- 40 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the
value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions under
subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse of a Post-2004 Participant under Section 4.6 shall
be determined under subsection (a) below .
(a) Calculation : An Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension shall be equal to:
(1)     The Eligible Spouse’ s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, reduced by
(2)     The Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension.
(b) Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1) An Eligible Spouse’ s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension” means the greater
of:
(i) The amount of the Eligible Spouse’ s pre-retirement spouse’ s pension determined
under the principles and limitations of Section 5.1(b) and under the terms of the Salaried Plan in
effect on December 31, 2004 (except as otherwise applicable under Section 5.1(b)),
- 41 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as
such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial
adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of the Salaried Plan (relating to benefits that are deferred beyond
the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii) The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension determined under the principles and limitations of Section 5.1(b) and under
subsection (c).
In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated with
reference to the specific time of payment applicable to the Eligible Spouse.
(2)    An “Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension” means
the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension that would be payable to the Eligible Spouse under the principles
and limitations of Section 5.1(b) under the terms of the Salaried Plan in ef fect on December 31, 2004
(except as otherwise applicable under Section 5.1(b)).
(c) PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension : An Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below , whichever is
applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the Participant under
Section 5.2.
- 42 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(1) Normal Rule : The Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable under this
paragraph shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity , under a Qualified
Joint and Survivor Annuity , if the Participant had:
(i) Separated from service on the earliest of the date of death, his actual
Severance from Service Date;
(ii) Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date
payments of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension are to commence; and
(iii) Died on the day immediately following such commencement.
If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under this paragraph commences or is deemed to
commence prior to the date which would have been the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date,
appropriate reductions for early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity upon which the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension is based.
(2) Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees : Notwithstanding paragraph (1)
above, the Pre‑Retirement Spouse’ s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in Section 4.6(a)
shall not be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined
under Section 5.2 in accordance with the principles and limitations of Section
- 43 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
5.1(b) (if a comparable 25 percent benefit is available on behalf of the Participant under the Salaried
Plan). A Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under this paragraph is not reduced for early commencement.
5.4    Certain Adjustments : Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to
adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a
nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a
member of the PepsiCo Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals.
(a) Adjustments for Rehired Participants : This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee
under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits
are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified
plans.
(b) Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified plan
on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the
increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the
PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder ,
the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover
- 44 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and
any specified plans.
5.5    Excludable Employment : Effective for periods of employment on or after June 30, 1997, an executive
classified as level 22 or above (or the equivalent) whose employment by an Employer is for a limited duration
assignment shall not become entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment. In
addition, in the case of agreements entered into after January 1, 2009, an executive who has signed a written
agreement with the Company pursuant to which the individual either (i) waives eligibility under the Plan (even if the
individual otherwise meets the definition of Employee under the Plan), or (ii) agrees not to participate in the Plan, shall
not thereafter becomes entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment
(whichever applies). Written agreements may be entered into either before or after the executive becomes eligible for
or begins participation in the Plan, and such written agreement may take any form that is deemed ef fective by the
Company . All written agreements under this section 5.5 shall be irrevocable by the individual once executed.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
ARTICLE VI.  
Distribution Options
The terms of this Article govern (i) the distribution of benefits to a Participant who becomes entitled to a
Pre-409A Pension, and (ii) the continuation of benefits (if any) to such Participant’ s beneficiary following the
Participant’ s death. Other than as set forth in section 4.9 (cashout distributions), a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension
derived from the Pre-409A Program shall be payable as an Annuity for the life of the Eligible Spouse (except as
provided in Article VI of Part B of the Salaried Plan). The distribution of a 409A Pension is governed by the terms of the
409A Program.
6.1    Form and T iming of Distributions : This section shall govern the form and timing of distributions of
Pre-409A Pensions that begin on or after March 1, 1992. Plan distributions that begin before that date shall be
governed by the prior terms of the Plan. The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in all cases subject to the cashout rules
set forth in Section 4.9.
(a) No Advance Election : This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who does not have an
Advance Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, or (ii) who
terminates employment prior to Retirement. Subject to the next sentence, a Participant described in this
subsection shall be paid his Pre-409A Pension in the same form and at the same time as he is paid his Pension
under the Salaried Plan. If a Participant’ s Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still an
employee of the PepsiCo Organization (because of the time of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)(9)),
payment under the Plan shall not begin until the
- 46 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
first of the month next following the Participant’ s Severance from Service Date. In this instance, the form of
payment under this Plan shall remain that applicable under the Salaried Plan. If the Participant will be paid his
pension under the Salaried Plan in a form of payment that is not available to the Participant under this Pre-409A
Program ( e.g., because the Participant attains Retirement status under the Salaried Plan but does not attain
Retirement status under this Pre-409A Program, based on applying the terms of the Salaried Plan in ef fect on
December 31, 2004), the principles of subsection (b)(2) below will govern the determination of the Participant’ s
form of payment.
(b) Advance Election in Ef fect: This subsection shall apply to a Participant who has an Advance
Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date. To be in ef fect, an Advance
Election must meet the advance receipt and other requirements of Section 6.3(b).
(1) Lump Sum Election : If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election
to receive a Single Lump Sum in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date,
the Participant’ s Pre-409A Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid as a Single Lump Sum as of
the first of the month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date.
(2) Annuity Election : If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election to
receive an Annuity in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid in an Annuity beginning on the
first of the month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date. The following
- 47 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
provisions of this paragraph govern the form of Annuity payable in the case of a Participant described in
this paragraph.
(i) Salaried Plan Election : A Participant who has a qualifying Salaried Plan election
shall receive his distribution in the same form of Annuity the Participant selected in such
qualifying Salaried Plan election. For this purpose, a “qualifying Salaried Plan election” is a written
election of a form of payment by the Participant that: (A) is currently in ef fect under the Salaried
Plan as of the close of business on the day before the Participant’ s Retirement Date, and
(B) specifies an Annuity as the form of payment for all or part of the Participant’ s Retirement
Pension under the Salaried Plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a Participant who
elects a combination lump sum and Annuity under the Salaried Plan is considered to have
specified an Annuity for part of his Salaried Plan Pension.
(ii) PEP Election : A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) and who has a
PEP Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date shall
receive his distribution in the form of Annuity the Participant selects in such PEP Election.
(iii) No PEP Election : A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii)
above shall receive his distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if he is
married, or in the form of a Single Life Annuity if he is not married. For purposes of this
- 48 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
subparagraph (iii), a Participant shall be considered married if he is married on the day before his
Retirement Date.
6.2    Available Forms of Payment : The forms of payment set forth in subsections (a) and (b) may be
provided to any Participant who is entitled to a Pre-409A Retirement Pension. The forms of payment for other
Participants are set forth in subsection (c) below . The provisions of this section are ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates
after 1989 and earlier distributions shall be governed by prior terms of the Plan.
(a) Basic Forms of Payment : A Participant’ s Pre-409A Retirement Pension shall be distributed in
one of the forms of payment listed in this subsection. The particular form of payment applicable to a Participant
shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.1. Payments shall commence on the date specified in
Section 6.1 and shall end on the date specified in this subsection.
(1) Single Life Annuity Option : A Participant may receive his Pre-409A Pension in the form
of a Single Life Annuity , which provides monthly payments ending with the last payment due prior to his
death.
(2) Survivor Options : A Participant may receive his Pre-409A Pension in accordance with
one of the following survivor options:
(i) 100 Percent Survivor Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-409A
Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in
the same reduced amount shall continue after the Participant’ s death to his beneficiary for life,
beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following
- 49 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
the Participant’ s death and ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’ s
death.
(ii) 75 Percent Survivor Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-409A
Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in
the amount of 75 percent of such reduced Pre-409A Pension shall be continued after the
Participant’ s death to his beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the
beneficiary’ s death.
(iii) 50 Percent Survivor Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-409A
Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in
the amount of 50 percent of such reduced Pre-409A Pension shall be continued after the
Participant’ s death to his beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the
beneficiary’ s death. A 50 percent survivor option under this paragraph shall be a Qualified Joint
and Survivor Annuity if the Participant’ s beneficiary is his Eligible Spouse.
(iv) Ten Years Certain and Life Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-
409A Pension which shall be payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months. If
the retired Participant
- 50 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
dies before 120 payments have been made, the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the
remainder of the 120 month period to the Participant’ s primary beneficiary (or if the primary
beneficiary has predeceased the Participant, the Participant’ s contingent beneficiary).
(3) Single Lump Sum Payment Option : A Participant may receive payment of his Pre-409A
Pension in the form of a Single Lump Sum payment.
(4) Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit Option : A Participant who does not have an
Advance Election in ef fect may receive a portion of his Pre-409A Pension in the form of a lump sum
payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in paragraphs (1)
and (2) above. The Pre-409A Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole
number percentages designated by the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the Plan
Administrator . For the election to be ef fective, the sum of the two percentages designated by the
Participant must equal 100 percent.
(i) The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is determined
by multiplying: (A) the amount that would be payable to the Participant as a Single Lump Sum
payment if the Participant’ s entire benefit were payable in that form, by (B) the percentage that
the Participant has designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.
(ii) The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is
determined by multiplying: (A) the amount of the
- 51 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
monthly benefit elected by the Participant, determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2)
above (whichever applies), by (B) the percentage that the Participant has designated for receipt in
the form of a monthly benefit.
(b) Inflation Protection : The following levels of inflation protection may be provided to any
Participant who is entitled to a Pre-409A Retirement Pension (except to the extent such Pre-409A Pension is
paid as a lump sum).
(1) 5 Percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,
but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 5 percent. The amount of the
increase shall be the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 5 percent.
(2) 7 Percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,
but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 7 percent. The amount of the
increase shall be the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 7 percent.
Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1, beginning with the
second January 1 following the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior year shall
be determined based on inflation in the 12-month period ending on September 30 of such year , with inflation
measured in the same manner as applies on the Ef fective Date for adjusting Social Security benefits for changes
in the cost of living. Inflation protection that is in ef fect shall carry over to any survivor benefit payable on behalf
of a Participant, and shall increase the otherwise
- 52 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
applicable survivor benefit as provided above. Any election by a Participant to receive inflation protection shall
be irrevocable by such Participant or his surviving beneficiary .
(c) Available Options for V ested Benefits : The forms of payment available for a Participant with a
Pre-409A V ested Pension are a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or a 75 Percent Survivor Annuity for
married Participants, and a Single Life Annuity for both married and unmarried Participants. The applicable form
of payment shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.1(a).
6.3    Procedures for Elections : This section sets forth the procedures for making Advance Elections and
PEP Elections.
(a) In General : To qualify as an Advance Election or PEP Election for purposes of Section 6.1, an
election must be made in writing, on the form designated by the Plan Administrator , and must be signed by the

(c) PEP Election : A PEP Election may only be made by a Participant who has an Advance
Election to receive an Annuity in ef fect at the time his PEP Election is received by the Plan Administrator . In

does not have an Advance Election in ef fect at such time.
(d) Elections Rules for Annuity Starting Dates : When amounts become payable to a Participant in
accordance with Article IV , they shall be payable as of the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date and the election
procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’ s unpaid accruals under
this Pre-409A Program as of such Annuity Starting Date, with the following exception. In the case of a
Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving an Annuity that
remained in pay status upon rehire, or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum distribution (other than a cashout
distribution described in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a result of his
termination of reemployment), and the election procedures at such subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall

- 55 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Starting Date shall continue to be payable in accordance with the elections made at his initial Annuity Starting
Date under this Pre-409A Program.
For purposes of this section, an election shall be treated as received on a particular day if it is: (A) postmarked that day ,
or (B) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day . Delivery under clause (B) must be made by the close of
business, which time is to be determined by the Plan Administrator .
6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options :
(a) Effect of Certain Deaths : If a Participant makes a PEP Election for a form of payment
described in Section 6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section 6.2(a)(2)
(iv)) dies before the PEP Election becomes ef fective, the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant dies
after such PEP Election becomes ef fective but before his Pre-409A Retirement Pension actually commences,
the election shall be given ef fect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary
shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall
be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant who has elected the form of payment described in
Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant dies: (i) after the PEP Election has become ef fective, (ii) without a
surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment,
then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If
payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and
such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of
payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
- 56 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(b) Nonspouse Beneficiaries : If a Participant’ s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse, he may not
elect:
(i) The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his nonspouse
beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than he is, or
(ii) The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his nonspouse
beneficiary is more than 19 years younger than he is.
6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a
form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts
payable on his death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed
under the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv),
the Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant (whether
active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his
election is finally ef fective. The designation of any beneficiary , and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in
accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and
until filed with the Plan Administrator . If no beneficiary is properly designated, then a Participant’ s election of a
survivor ’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2) shall not be given ef fect. A Participant entitled to a Pre-409A V ested
Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the Participant is permitted under Section 6.2 to elect
an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse on his Annuity Starting Date.

6.6    Payment of FICA and Related Income T axes : As provided in section 6.7 of the Plan Document for
the Section 409A Program, a portion of a Participant’ s 409A Pension, if any , shall be paid as a single lump sum and
remitted directly to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or other applicable tax authority in satisfaction of the
Participant’ s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at source on wages (imposed under Code Section
3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable state, local or foreign tax laws as a result of the
payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of income tax at source on wages that is attributable to the
pyramiding of wages and taxes (all such amounts due are referred to collectively as “Employment T axes”). To the
extent that a Participant’ s 409A Pension, if any , is insuf ficient to pay the Employment T axes when due (including if the
Participant’ s 409A Pension has not commenced at the time the Employment T axes are due), a portion of the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension, if any , shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the applicable tax
authority in satisfaction of any amounts necessary to satisfy fully the Employment T axes.

ARTICLE VII.  
Administration
7.1    Authority to Administer Plan : The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator , which shall
have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator
shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant
in writing, including the Participant’ s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator ’s
interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties
concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that
might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to
the Company or the Plan Administrator .
7.2    Facility of Payment : Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a person entitled to receive any
payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to
be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the legal
representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of such
person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the
provisions of the Plan.
- 59 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to
construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such
benefits, and its decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid
only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This
discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the
Plan Administrator is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall
be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of
discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a
Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the
Plan Administrator , will provide such claimant the claims review process described in this Section. The Plan
Administrator has the discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any manner so long
as the claims review process, as modified, includes the steps described below . Within a 90-day response period
following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator , the Plan Administrator will notice the claimant of:
(a) The specific reason or reasons for the denial;
(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to
perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
- 60 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(d) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such
process and a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on
review).
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances required an extension of time for processing the claim it
may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant
before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by
which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. Further review of a claim is available upon written
request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the claimant receives written notice of the denial
of the claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including
the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, documents, records and other information relevant to the
claim and the Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information
regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made
within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed
an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial
60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan
Administrator expects to make the final decisions. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific
Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
- 61 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator , or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on
the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review
shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this Section as is more fully explained in
Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this Section may be sent
pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable
guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion shall
create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other
provision, is less complete or broad.
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:  Before filing any Claim
(including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s
rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is
intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary
to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of
the Plan’ s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be
limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before the Plan Administrator in the claims
procedure.
- 62 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other
Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater
significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with novel
Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the
Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the
submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim)
shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims
procedures of Section 7.5 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis
or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as
are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the
following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan;
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;
- 63 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(C)     The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of
applicable law;
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly
adopted or put into ef fect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or
requirements of ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms,
conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or
requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan
Administrator , or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way .
(iii)    A “Claimant” is any Employee, former Employee, Participant, former Participant,
Beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing
individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or
the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.

filed under Article VII and any action filed in state or federal court by
- 64 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity
(collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or
violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first
accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall
be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits
that are the subject of the claim or legal action, (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on
which payments shall commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are
the basis of his claim. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with
ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts
that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this
two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of
action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3
shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
7.7    Restriction on V enue:  Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the
Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 7.6 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United States

Miscellaneous
8.1    No guarantee of Employment : Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of

without cause.
8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits : Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits
under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge,

8.4    Action by the Company : Any action by the Company under this Plan, including any amendment

Accordingly , in determining rights and benefits under this Pre-409A Program, changes in the Salaried Plan that are

Program that would constitute a material modification for purposes of Section 409A.

Amendment and T ermination
This Article governs the Company’ s right to amend and or terminate the Plan. The Company’ s
amendment and termination powers under this Article shall be subject, in all cases, to the restrictions on amendment

Date under
- 68 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
this Plan or under the Salaried Plan; provided, however , that no amendment of the Plan shall be ef fective to the extent
that the amendment would be considered a “material modification” (as that term is defined in Section 409A) of the Pre-
409A Program and would, as a result, cause the Pre-409A Program to be subject to Section 409A. An Employer (other
than the Company) shall not have the right to amend the Plan.
9.3    Termination : The Company may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the

ERISA Plan Structure
This Plan document in conjunction with the plan document(s) for the 409A Program encompasses three
separate plans within the meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into separate
plans shall be ef fective as of July 1, 1996; previously the plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a single plan
within the meaning of ERISA.
(a) Excess Benefit Plan : An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA,
maintained solely for the purpose of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations
on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.
(b) Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the
purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides benefits for
Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits

providing deferred compensation for a select group of
- 70 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.
The plan provides grandfather benefits to those Salaried Plan participants described in section 5.2(a) hereof, by
preserving for them the pre-1989 level of benefit accrual that was in ef fect before the Salaried Plan’ s
amendment ef fective January 1, 1989 (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan and
Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan). For ERISA reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as
the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan II.
Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose
indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan, to the
extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the
Preservation T op Hat Plan. These three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by the Company .

ARTICLE A  
Accruals for 1993 and 1994
This Article A of the Appendix shall be ef fective on the date the Plan is adopted.
A.1 Accruals for 1993 and 1994 : This section shall apply to any individual: 
(i) who is a Salaried Plan Participant and employed by the PepsiCo Organization on 
December 31, 1993, (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension is vested during 1993 (or would become vested in 1994 if his
Service included the assumed period of continued service specified in (a)(1) below), and (iii) whose minimum 1993
Pension in subsection (a) below is not derived solely from that portion of the Plan described in (c) of Article X. In
determining the amount of the 1993 and 1994 Pension amounts for any such individual, the provisions set forth in
subsections (a) and (b) below shall apply .
(a) Minimum 1993 Pension : Any individual who is covered by this section shall accrue a minimum
1993 Pension as of December 31, 1993. In determining the amount of such individual’ s minimum 1993 Pension,
the following shall apply .
(1) An individual’ s Service and Credited Service as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to
equal the respective Service and Credited Service he would have if his Service continued through
December 31, 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the assumed period of continued Service
shall be less to the extent the Corporation’ s human resource records on December 31, 1993 reflect a
scheduled termination date in 1994 for such
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
individual. In this case, the individual’ s assumed period of continued service shall be the portion of 1994
that ends with such scheduled termination date.
(2) An individual’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be
adjusted by the actuary’ s salary scale assumption which is used under the Salaried Plan, so that they
equal the amount such scale projects for the individual as of the end of 1994. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the following special rules shall apply .
(i) A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected 1994
earnings as reflected on the “Special PEP Salary Scale” of the PepsiCo Benefits Department on
December 31, 1993 are higher than would be assumed under the first sentence of this paragraph.
In this case, the individual’ s 1993 earnings shall be adjusted using such higher salary scale.
(ii) In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph (1)
above is less than all of 1994, the salary adjustment under the preceding provisions of this
paragraph shall be reduced to the amount that would apply if the individual had no earnings after
his scheduled termination date.
(3) An individual’ s attained age as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to be the age he
would have at the end of the assumed period of continued service applicable under paragraph (1) above.
Any individual who is covered by this section, and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31, 1993, shall
be vested as of such date in both his Pension (determined

2005 Participant’ s Eligible Spouse shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50
percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding reduction

benefit commencement date precedes the date the Pre-2005 Participant would attain his
Normal Retirement Date.

ARTICLE I – Foreword
The PEP Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PBG for the benefit of salaried
employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”).
PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible
employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.
This Plan is first ef fective April 6, 1999. The Plan is a successor plan to the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan,
which was last restated ef fective as of January 1, 1989. The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan covers eligible
employees at the various divisions of PepsiCo, Inc., including eligible employees who are employed at various Pepsi-
Cola Company facilities. On April 6, 1999, when this Plan became ef fective, PBG had its initial public of fering. PBG
employs many of the individuals employed at Pepsi-Cola Company facilities who were covered under the PepsiCo
Pension Equalization Plan. This initial Plan document closely mirrors the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan
document, including its historical provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under this Plan.

reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if

Spouse’ s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, that is greater
than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this
section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is
the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this
section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse. In this instance, the
Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit
payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the
Participant’ s life.

Service Date);
(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date payments of the
Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension are to commence; and (iii)    Died on the day immediately
following such commencement.
If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under this paragraph commences prior to the date which
would have been the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date,
- 115 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
appropriate reductions for early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity
upon which the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension is based.
(2)    Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees : Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the

(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified plan on
behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is by
order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the PEP benefit for the
Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall
take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no
duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
5.5    Excludable Employment : Effective for periods of employment on or after June 30, 1997, an executive

Pension under the Plan.
6.1    Form and T iming of Distributions : This section shall govern the form and timing of distributions of Pre-409A
Pensions that begin on or after March 1, 1992. Plan distributions that begin before that date shall be governed by Prior
Plan as in ef fect at the time of the distribution. The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in all cases subject to the cashout
rules set forth in Section 4.9.
(a)    No Advance Election : This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who does not have an Advance
Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, or (ii) who terminates employment
prior to Retirement. Subject to the next sentence, a Participant described in this subsection shall be paid his Pre-409A
Pension in the same form and at the same time as he is paid his Pension under the Salaried Plan. If a Participant’ s
Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still an employee of the PBG Organization (because of the time
of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)(9)), payment under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month
next following the Participant’ s Severance from Service Date. In this instance, the form of payment under this Plan shall
remain that applicable under the Salaried Plan.
(b)    Advance Election in Ef fect: This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who has an Advance
Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, and (ii) whose Retirement Date is

business on the day before the Participant’ s Retirement Date, and (B) specifies an Annuity as the form of
payment for all or part of the Participant’ s Retirement Pension under the Salaried Plan. For purposes of

for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in the same reduced

- 121 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if the Participant’ s beneficiary is his Eligible Spouse.
(iv)    Ten Years Certain and Life Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension
which shall be payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months. If the retired Participant
dies before 120 payments have been made, the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the remainder
of the 120 month period to the Participant’ s primary beneficiary (or if the primary beneficiary has

form of a Single Lump Sum payment.

Advance Election in ef fect may receive a portion of his Pension in the form of a lump sum payment, and the
remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above. The
Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated by
the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the Plan Administrator . For the election to be ef fective, the
sum of the two percentages designated by the Participant must equal 100 percent.
(i)    The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by multiplying:
(A) the amount that would be payable to the Participant as a Single Lump Sum payment if the
Participant’ s entire benefit were
- 122 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
payable in that form, by (B) the percentage that the Participant has designated for receipt in the form of a
lump sum.
(ii)    The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by
multiplying: (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Participant, determined in accordance
with paragraph (1) or (2) above (whichever applies), by (B) the percentage that the Participant has
designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.
(b)    Inflation Protection : The following levels of inflation protection may be provided to any Participant
who is entitled to a Retirement Pension (except to the extent such Pension is paid as a lump sum).
(1)    5 percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced, but
thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 5 percent. The amount of the increase shall be
the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 5 percent.
(2)    7 percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced, but
thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 7 percent. The amount of the increase shall be
the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 7 percent.
Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1, beginning with the second
January 1 following the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior year shall be determined
based on inflation in the 12 month period ending on September 30 of such year , with inflation measured in the same
manner as applies on January 1, 1989 for adjusting Social Security benefits for changes in the cost of living.
- 123 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Inflation protection that is in ef fect shall carry over to any survivor benefit payable on behalf of a Participant, and shall
increase the otherwise applicable survivor benefit as provided above. Any election by a Participant to receive inflation
protection shall be irrevocable by such Participant or his surviving beneficiary .
(c)    Available Options for V ested Benefits : The forms of payment available for a Participant with a V ested
Pension are a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for married Participants and a Single Life Annuity for both married
and unmarried Participants. The applicable form of payment shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.1(a).

Elections.
(a)    In General : To qualify as an Advance Election or PEP Election for purposes of Section 6.1, an

procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’ s unpaid accruals as of such
Annuity Starting Date, with the following exception. In the case of a Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity
Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving an Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire, or (ii) was previously
paid a lump sum distribution (other than a cashout distribution described in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant’ s
subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a result of his termination of reemployment), and the election procedures at such
subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall apply only to the portion of his benefit that accrues after his rehire. Any prior
accruals that remain to be paid as of the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity Starting Date shall continue to be payable in

6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options :
(a)    Effect of Certain Deaths : If a Participant makes a PEP Election for a form of payment described in
Section 6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies before the
PEP Election becomes ef fective, the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant dies after such PEP Election
becomes ef fective but before his Retirement Pension actually commences, the election shall be given ef fect and the
amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month
following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant
who has elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant dies: (i) after the PEP
Election has become ef fective, (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120
payments under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to
the Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or
contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due
under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
(b)    Nonspouse Beneficiaries : If a Participant’ s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse, he may not elect:

(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his nonspouse beneficiary
is more than 19 years younger than he is.
6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of
payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his
death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed under the Salaried
Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the Participant shall
be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant (whether active or former)
shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his election is finally
effective. The designation of any beneficiary , and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with
rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the
Plan Administrator (or for periods before the Ef fective Date, the Plan Administrator under the Prior Plan). If no
beneficiary is properly designated, then a Participant’ s election of a survivor ’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
ARTICLE I  
Foreword
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the
benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried Employees
Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the
Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP
provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B
thereof).
1989 Restatement . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.
409A Program Document 2005 Restatement . The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety
effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits
that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or
materially modified within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).
Amendments to the 2005 Restatement . The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into
this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011.
The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG
PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits that
were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain administrative provisions that
are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is
- 1 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
explained in Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are
subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”) under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP
Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP
Document.
2017 and 2019 Restatements . This restatement of the 409A Program Document is ef fective as of January
1, 2019. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated ef fective as of January 1,
2017.
Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are not subject to
the 409A Program (i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially
modified thereafter within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for
the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together , this document and the document for the Pre‑409A
Program describe the terms of a single plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and
amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the
terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts
and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain exempt
from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.

ARTICLE II  
Definitions and Construction
2.1    Definitions : This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below . Where the
following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with
initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below , unless a dif ferent meaning is plainly required by the context.
Accrued Benefit : The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with
Article V , based on the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of
determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the
Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the
factors set forth below . The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable
under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is amended to provide
new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless
specifically adopted by the amendment.
(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection : To determine the amount of a Pension payable in
the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity , as an annuity with
inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity , the Plan Administrator shall select the factors
that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2009, the factors
- 3 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
selected by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the
Appendix). Thereafter , the Plan Administrator shall review such factors for forms of payment (including
for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall amend such factors in its discretion. In general,
a Participant shall have no right to have any of the actuarial factors specified for forms of payment under
the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit (or any portion thereof), except to the extent that a
particular factor is currently in ef fect at the time it is to be applied under the Plan. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of
payment selected by the Plan Administrator from time-to-time may be applied retroactively to already
accrued benefits, and without regard to the actuarial factors that may have applied previously for such
purpose. However , in adjusting benefits under the Plan using those factors in Schedule 1 (below) that
become ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, the right to receive a benefit that
is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall apply to the same
extent (and in the same manner) as applies under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried
Plan Factors. For this purpose, the phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that
appear in the Salaried Plan’ s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” ef fective for annuity starting dates (as
defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. Effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or
after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor , period certain annuity or other death benefit
annuity with inflation protection, Schedule 1(b) shall apply
- 4 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period certain or other death benefit, and
Schedule 1(c) or (d) shall apply solely to adjust for the elected inflation protection (for this purpose and
as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from applying
these factors from separate Schedules shall be determined using an actuarial computation method that
is reasonable and applied consistently to similarly situated participants).

(2)    Lump Sums : To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, a Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension under Section 4.6, or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension under Section
4.12, the lump sum equivalent factors currently applicable to lump sum distributions under the Salaried
Plan shall apply (disregarding transition factors). These factors are subject to change in accordance with
paragraph (1) above.
(3)    Other Cases : To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or
on behalf of a Participant in other cases, the factors
- 5 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan. In this respect, the 2019 Salaried Plan
Factors shall be ef fective hereunder for Annuity Starting Dates (as defined under this Plan) on or after
January 1, 2019. These factors are subject to change in accordance with paragraph (1) above.
Annuity : A Pension payable as a series of monthly payments for at least the life of the Participant.

a subsequent Annuity Starting Date for such benefits only to the extent provided in Section 6.3(b).
Cashout Limit : The annual dollar limit on elective deferrals under Code section 402(g)(1)(B), as in
effect from time to time.

2001 until December 31, 2004, and was then reemployed by the PepsiCo Organization on January 1, 2005 until

1.415(c)-2(e), and 1.415(c)-2(g). The Plan Administrator shall determine who is a Key Employee in

(2)    Applicable Y ear. Effective from and after December 31, 2007, the Plan Administrator
shall identify Key Employees as of the last day of
- 11 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
each calendar year , based on compensation for such year , and such designation shall be ef fective for
purposes of this Plan for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1st of the next following calendar
year ( e.g., the Key Employee identification by the Plan Administrator as of December 31, 2008 shall be
effective for the period from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010).
(3)    Rule of Administrative Convenience . Effective beginning with the December 31, 2017
identification date, in addition to the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall treat all other employees
classified as Leadership Group 6 and above on the applicable identification date prescribed in paragraph
(2) as Key Employees ef fective for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1st of the next following
calendar year (however , from the April 1, 2008 ef fective date through February 25, 2010, Band IV and
above applied in lieu of Leadership Group 6 and above); provided that if this would result in counting
more than 200 individuals as Key Employees as of any such determination date, then the number
treated as Key Employees will be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees
otherwise added by this paragraph (3) in order by their base compensation, from the lowest to the
highest.
(4)    Identification of Key Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010 . For
the period between February 26, 2010 and March 31 2010, Key Employees shall be identified by
combining the lists of Key Employees of all members of the PepsiCo Organization as in ef fect
immediately prior to February 26, 2010. The foregoing method of identifying Key Employees
- 12 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
is intended to comply with T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(i)(6)(i), which authorizes the use of an alternative
method of identifying specified employees that complies with T reas. Reg. §§ 1.409A-1(i)(5) and -1(i)(8)
and Section VII.C.4.d of the Preamble to the Final Regulations under Section 409A of the Code, which
permits “service recipients to simply combine the pre-transaction separate lists of specified employees
where it is determined that such treatment would be administratively less burdensome.”
(5)    Identification of Key Employees from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2018 .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the 12-month periods beginning on the April 1, 2010 ef fective date
through March 31, 2018, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:
(i)    For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 2011, an
employee shall be a Key Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified as at
least a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee shall be
considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is classified as
one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i) a Band IV
employee or above in a PepsiCo Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a PBG Business,
or (iii) a Salary Grade 19 employee or above at a P AS Business.
(ii)    For the twelve-month period that begins on April 1, 2011, and for each twelve-
month period that begins on April 1 in subsequent years through March 31, 2017, an employee
shall be a Key
- 13 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if the employee was an employee of the PepsiCo
Organization who was classified as Band IV or above on the December 31 that immediately
precedes such April 1.
(iii)    For the period covered by this paragraph (5) notwithstanding the rule of
administrative convenience in paragraph (3) above, an employee shall be a Key Employee for the
12-month period that begins on any April 1, if as of the preceding December 31 the employee
would be a specified employee, within the meaning of T reasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i), or any
successor , by applying as of such December 31 the default rules that apply under such regulation
for determining the minimum number of a service recipient’ s specified employees. If the preceding
sentence and the methods for identifying Key Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above,
taken together , would result in more than 200 individuals being counted as Key Employees as of
any December 31 determination date, then the number of individuals treated as Key Employees
pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first sentence of this
subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees
otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base
compensation to the highest.
(iv)    For purposes of this paragraph (5), “P AS Business” means each employer ,
division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company
classifies as part of the P AS
- 14 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PBG business; and “PepsiCo
Business” means each employer , division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an

The method for identifying Key Employees set forth in this definition is intended as an alternative method of

and applied consistently with the rules applicable to such alternative arrangements.

predecessor plans to PERP-A and PERP-I.
Section 409A : Section 409A of the Code.
Separation from Service : A Participant’ s separation from service with the PepsiCo Organization,
within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). The term may also be used as a verb ( i.e., “Separates from
Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’ s transfer to an
entity owned 20% or more by the Company will not constitute a Separation of Service to the extent permitted by
Section 409A. A Participant’ s “Final Separation from Service” is the date of his Separation from Service that
most recently precedes his Annuity Starting Date; provided, however , that to the extent a Participant is
reemployed after an Annuity Starting Date, he will have a new Final Separation from Service with respect to any
benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles shall generally
apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:
- 23 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(1)    A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires,
or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company . Whether a termination of employment
has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the Company and
the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or
that the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or
independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of
bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in which
the Employee provided services to the Company if the Employee has been providing services for less
than 36 months).
(2)    An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if
such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such
leave does not exceed a period of six months or , if longer , such longer period of time during which a right
to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months and
the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by contract, the
employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six-month
period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a
- 24 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee to be
unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of
employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such six-month period.
(3)    If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the Board
of Directors of the Company , the services provided as a Director are generally not taken into account in
determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as an Employee for purposes of the
Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.
Service : The period of a Participant’ s employment calculated in accordance with Section 3.2 for
purposes of determining his entitlement to benefits under the Plan.
Single Life Annuity : A level monthly Annuity payable to a Participant for his life only , with no
survivor benefits to his Eligible Spouse or any other person.
Single Lump Sum : The distribution of a Participant’ s total 409A Pension in the form of a single
payment, which payment shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s 409A Pension as of the
Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date (or Late Retirement Date, if applicable), but not less than the Actuarial
Equivalent of the Participant’ s 409A Pension as of the Participant’ s Early Retirement Date, in the case of a
Participant who is entitled to an immediate Early 409A Retirement Pension.
Social Security Act : The Social Security Act of the United States, as amended, an enactment
providing governmental benefits in connection with events such as old age, death and disability . Any reference
herein to the Social Security Act (or
- 25 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
any of the benefits provided thereunder) shall be taken as a reference to any comparable governmental program
of another country , as determined by the Plan Administrator , but only to the extent the Plan Administrator judges
the computation of those benefits to be administratively feasible.
Taxable W age Base : The contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the
Social Security Act) in ef fect for the Plan Y ear.
Vested Pension : The Pension available to a Participant under Section 4.3. The term “409A V ested
Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a V ested Pension that is derived from the 409A Program. The
term “Pre-409A V ested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a V ested Pension that is derived from the
Pre-409A Program.
2.2    Construction : The terms of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with this section.
(a)    Gender and Number : The masculine gender , where appearing in the Plan, shall be deemed
to include the feminine gender , and the singular may include the plural, unless the context clearly indicates to the
contrary .
(b)    Compounds of the W ord “Here” : The words “hereof”, “hereunder” and other similar
compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or section.
(c)    Examples : Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by
a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the Plan shall be
construed as if the phrase “without
- 26 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limits
on its breadth of application).
(d)    Subdivisions of the Plan Document : This Plan document is divided and subdivided using the
following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, and sub-clauses.
Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a
decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by
Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals in parentheses.
Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses. Sub-clauses are designated by upper-case roman

When a 409A Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Participant under this Plan, the amount of
such 409A Pension shall be determi ned under Section 5.1 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to any adjustments
required under Sections 4.6(b) and 5.4.
5.1    Participant’ s 409A Pension : Subject to Section 8.7 (Section 457A), a Participant’ s 409A Pension

the basis specified in subsection (b) below and using the definitions appearing in subsection (c) below):
(1)    His T otal Pension, reduced by
(2)    His Salaried Plan Pension, and then further reduced by  (but not below zero)
(3)    His Pre-409A Pension.
(b)    Basis for Determining : The 409A Pension amount in subsection (a) above shall be
determined on a basis that (i) takes into account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of the
Annuity Starting Date of the 409A Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary , the relative value of forms of
payment, (iii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial Equivalent, in each such
respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and in accordance with rules authorized by the
Plan Administrator , including to take account
- 40 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
the time and form of any prior payments and to eliminate all duplication of benefits as determined by the Plan
Administrator , and (iv) ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates after December 31, 2018, allows a Participant’ s 409A
Pension to provide a makeup (as appropriate under the circumstances under rules authorized by the Plan
Administrator) for the application of early commencement reduction factors to the Participant’ s Pre-409A
Pension that apply a greater early commencement reduction to such Pre-409A Pension than would apply under
the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors (including with respect to any portion of the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that
is derived from the PEP Guarantee).
(c)    Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)    A Participant’ s “Total Pension” means the greater of:
(i)    The amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of Part B of
the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415

are deferred beyond the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under
Section 5.2.
- 41 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 42 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
However , if the Participant was actively employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible
for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the
greater of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B)
shall not apply in determining the amount of a V ested Pension.
(i)    Formula A : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:
(A)    3 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the
first 10 years of Credited Service, plus

year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(C)    1-2/3 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be
calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he
remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest
Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Separation from Service,
and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which

years of Credited Service he would have earned had he remained in the employ of an Employer
until his Normal Retirement Age.

Amount, or
(B)    3 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of
years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social
Security Amount.
In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be
calculated on the basis of the Participant’ s Credited Service (determined in accordance with
Section 3.3(c)(3) of Part B of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Primary
Social Security Amount at the date of disability .
(2)    Calculation : The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to
paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity :    Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last
- 44 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner , the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a
survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no
corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to
the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable
under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor
benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by 0.8

Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to
such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4

amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement
Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement
Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b) reductions for any
Pre  Retirement Spouse’ s coverage and Section 4.12(b) reductions for any Pre-Retirement
Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life
of the surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner , that is greater than
that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this
section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s
behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing
provisions of this section.
- 46 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be
reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the
actuarial equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an
Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance,
the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the

without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion : The amount of the Retirement Pension determined
under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a
lump sum shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under
this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and
any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
For purposes of this paragraph (2), actuarial equivalence shall be determined taking into account the PEP
Guarantee’ s purpose to preserve substantially the
- 47 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
value of a benefit under the pre-1989 terms of the Plan and the 409A Plan’ s design that of fers alternative
annuities that are considered actuarial equivalent for purposes of Section 409A (taking into account,

1.409A-3(b)(ii)(C)).
5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement

above shall be determined on a basis (i) that takes into account applicable reductions for early or late
commencement, and (ii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial Equivalent as

under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by
sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the
Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan;
or
(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension determined under subsection (c).
In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated as if
payable as of what would be the Normal Retirement Date of the Participant related to the Eligible Spouse.
The greater benefit determined under the prior sentence shall then be reduced/increased for
commencement before/after , as applicable, such Normal Retirement Date.
(2)    An “Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension” means the

above, the Pre‑Retirement Spouse’ s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in Section 4.6(a)

Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the

Section 409A. For this purpose and to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A, the PEP Guarantee
under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits
are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified

- 51 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified
plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the
increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), then
the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A.
If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it
deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of
payments under this Plan and any specified plans to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A.
(c)    No Benefit Of fsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . Effective as of January 1, 2009, if a
Participant has earned a benefit under a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a
“qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the
“Transfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.5 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and Non-
Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the Participant’ s Total Pension under Section 5.1(c)(1) above only
to the extent the application of such rule to the Participant’ s 409A Pension will not result in a change in the time
or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on of fsets in the
preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the
payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan and
compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent
possible; to the extent
- 52 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

offsets in the prior sentence will not apply .

pursuant to which the individual either (i) waives eligibility under the Plan (even if the individual otherwise meets the
definition of Employee under the Plan), or (ii) agrees not to participate in the Plan, shall not thereafter become entitled
to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment (whichever applies). Written agreements
may be entered into either before or after the executive becomes eligible for or begins participation in the Plan, and
such written agreement may take any form that is deemed ef fective by the Company . This Section 5.5 shall apply with
respect to agreements that are entered into on or after January 1, 2009.
5.6    Pre-409A Pension : A Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension is the portion of the Participant’ s Pension that
is grandfathered under T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i) and (iv). Principles similar to those applicable under –
(i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2) shall apply in determining the Pre-409A Pension under
this section.
5.7    Offsets : Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company may reduce the amount of
any payment or benefit that is or would be payable to or on behalf of a Participant by the amount of any obligation of
the Participant to the Company that is or becomes due and payable, provided that (1) the obligation of the Participant to
the Company was incurred during the employment relationship, (2) the reduction during any Plan Y ear may not exceed
the amount allowed under Code Section 409A and (3) the reduction is made at the same time and in the same amount
as the obligation otherwise would have been due and
- 53 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
collectable from the Participant. In addition, in the event a Participant has earned a 409A Benefit (a “Prior 409A
Benefit”) that was paid before, or will become payable either before or under dif ferent payment terms than, an
additional 409A Benefit for the Participant, the calculation of the Participant’ s additional 409A Benefit shall include an
offset for the Prior 409A Benefit. This of fset shall be determined as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A
Benefit on a basis that (i) takes into account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of the Annuity
Starting Date of the additional 409A Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary , the relative value of forms of
payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts the of fset to its Actuarial Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and
customary under the circumstances and in accordance with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator . Therefore, by
way of example, but not by way of limitation, when pursuant to Section 4.5 a Participant is entitled to Post-Disability
Accruals after having become entitled to Pre-Separation Accruals, such an of fset of the Pre-Separation Accruals will
apply in determining the Post-Disability Accruals.
5.8    Amount of Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement
Domestic Partner ’s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Domestic Partner under Section 4.12 shall be

Program shall be payable as an Annuity for the life of the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, in
all cases, subject to Section 4.9 (cashout distributions). The distribution of a Pre-409A Pension is governed by the
terms of the Pre-409A Program.

Participant shall be considered married if he is married on his Annuity Starting Date (with such Annuity
Starting Date determined taking into account any election applicable under this subsection). To the
extent a Participant’ s benefit commences later than it would under paragraph 6.1(a)(1) as a result of an
election under this paragraph 6.1(a)(2), the Participant’ s benefit will be increased for earnings at the
interest rate used to compute the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value through the date the check for

accordance with Section 6.5 below . To the extent permitted by the Plan Administrator , an election made through
electronic media shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for a written election, and an electronic
affirmation of such an election shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for a signed election.
(b)    Multiple Annuity Starting Dates : When amounts become payable to a Participant in
accordance with Article IV , they shall be payable as of the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date and the election
procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’ s unpaid accruals as of

(c)    Determination of Marital Status . Effective January 1, 2014, in any case in which the form of

Plan Administrator , that he is married. The Participant shall give such notification to the Plan Administrator when
he makes the election described in subsection (a) above or in accordance with such other procedures that are
established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (if any). Notwithstanding the two prior sentences, the Plan
Administrator may adopt rules that provide for a dif ferent outcome than specified above.
6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options : The following special rules shall apply for the survivor options
available under Section 6.2.
(a)    Effect of Certain Deaths : If a Participant makes an election under Section 6.3(a) to receive his

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of the optional form of payment in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies prior to
the Annuity Starting Date of such Annuity , the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant dies after this

effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse, Eligible Domestic Partner or other beneficiary (as
applicable) shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the
Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant who has elected the form of payment
described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant: (i) dies after his Annuity Starting Date, (ii) without a
surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment,
then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If
payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and
such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of
payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
(b)    Beneficiary Who Is Not an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner : If a Participant’ s
beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , he may not elect:
(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his beneficiary is
more than 10 years younger than he is, or

6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected under Section 6.2 to receive all or part of
his Retirement Pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be
entitled to any amounts payable on his death. Such designation shall be made on the election form used to choose
such optional form of payment or an approved election form filed under the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In
the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the Participant shall be entitled to name both a
primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant (whether active or former) shall have the right to change
or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to his Annuity Starting Date. The designation of any beneficiary ,
and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A
beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator . If no beneficiary is
properly designated and a Participant’ s elects a survivor ’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2), the Participant’ s
beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable. A Participant entitled to a V ested
Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the Participant is permitted under Section 6.2 to elect
an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as
applicable, on his Annuity Starting Date.
6.6    Required Delay for Key Employees : Notwithstanding Section 6.1 above, if a Participant is classified

Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).
(b)    Distribution of a V ested Pension . In the case of a Participant who is entitled to a 409A V ested
Pension, distributions shall commence as provided in Section 6.1(b), or if later , on the earliest first of the month
that is at least six months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or , if earlier , the Participant’ s death).

payment and accumulated interest paid as a lump sum payment to the Participant on the date payment occurs in
accordance with subsection (a) or (b) above, whichever is applicable. If a Participant’ s beneficiary or estate is

Plan, with interest at the rate specified in the preceding sentence through the date the check for payment is

withholding are due to be deposited with the IRS, a lump sum payment equal to the Participant’ s FICA Amount
and any related income tax withholding shall be paid from the Participant’ s 409A Pension and remitted to the
IRS (or other applicable tax authority) in satisfaction of such FICA Amount and income tax withholding related to
such FICA Amount. The classification of a Participant as a Key Employee (as defined in Section 2.1) shall have
no ef fect on the timing of the lump sum payment under this subsection (a).
(b)    Reduction of 409A Pension . To reflect the payment of a Participant’ s FICA Amount and any

contemplated that this reduction may occur ef fective as of a date that is after the date payment of a Participant’ s
409A Pension commences.
(A)    No Ef fect on Commencement of 409A Pension . The Participant’ s 409A Pension shall

ARTICLE VII  
Administration
7.1    Authority to Administer Plan : The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator , which shall
have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator
shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant
in writing, including the Participant’ s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator ’s
interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties
concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that
might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to
the Company or the Plan Administrator .
7.2    Facility of Payment : Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a person entitled to receive any
payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to
be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the legal
representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of such
person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the
provisions of the Plan.
- 72 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to
construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such
benefits, and its decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid
only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This
discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the
Plan Administrator is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall
be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of
discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a
Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the
Plan Administrator , will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan
Administrator , a comprehensible written notice setting forth:
(a)    The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b)    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c)    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to
perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d)    A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such
process and a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on
review).
- 73 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim it
may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant
before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by
which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon written
request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator , or the designated party , within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of
written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair
review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and
other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such comments,
documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination.
The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances
warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished
to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension
and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing
and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with
references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request ad free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other
information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed
solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully
exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is
required to be sent to a claimant under this section may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of
Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion
shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other
provision, is less complete or broad.
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:  Before filing any Claim
(including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s
rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is
intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary
to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of
the Plan’ s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be
limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims
procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other
Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court
- 75 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator
may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the
rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established
specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case
the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall
apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.5 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis
or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as
are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of
the following –

(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan

conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty;

- 79 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

prior to the Covered T ransfer , the Company provides a written communication (either to the Participant individually , to a
group of similar Participants, to Participants generally , or in any other way that causes the communication to apply to

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
C.3    Benefit Formula for International T ransfer Participants :

(a)    Total Pension for International T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an
International T ransfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be
calculated as if he continued to receive Credited Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan while working for
the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary to which he transferred following his employment with an Employer based in
the United States, without regard to the actual date on which he ceased receiving Credited Service and Earnings
under the Salaried Plan. However , the T otal Pension of an International T ransfer Participant whose transfer to an
April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary occurred prior to 1992 shall not take into account Credited Service and Earnings
for employment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary prior to 1992.
(b)    Calculation of International T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The International T ransfer Participant’ s
benefit under the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a)

(4) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (T ransfers and Non-Duplication) with respect to his assignment with the

(a)    Total Pension for PIRP T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a PIRP
Transfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be calculated as provided
in paragraphs (1) and (2) below .
(1)    First, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be calculated as if he were an eligible
employee under the Salaried Plan for the entire Y ear of T ransfer , and as if he received Credited Service
and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer equal to – (i) his actual Credited Service
and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer , increased by  (ii) any other compensation
and service for the Y ear of T ransfer that would have been recognized as PIRP-DB Salary and PIRP DB
Pensionable Service, if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply for the Y ear of T ransfer .
(2)    If (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan)
the PIRP T ransfer Participant would be credited with PIRP-DB Salary that cannot be recognized under
PIRP as a result of Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB, and if this PIRP-DB Salary would be considered for accrual
purposes
- 113 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
under PIRP-DB in connection with PIRP-DB Pensionable Service that is not recognized under this Plan,
the increase in the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under PIRP that is related to this PIRP-DB
Pensionable Service and that is blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB shall be added to the PIRP T ransfer
Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under this Plan. In the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant who has a
Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, this increase in the PIRP T ransfers Participant’ s
Accrued Benefit under this Plan shall result in an appropriate increase, determined in the Company’ s
discretion, in the T otal Pension determined under paragraph (1) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
determining Credited Service and Earnings under this subsection (a), no compensation or service shall be
taken into account more than once, and a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be determined
in a way that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer
Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or
contributed to by the Company or an af filiate, but without applying any of fset that would violate Code
Section 409A.
(b)    Calculation of PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under the
Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a) above by the
reductions that are normally applicable under Article V . In addition, in the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant
who has a Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, if (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is
otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan) the value of the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under PIRP-DB
would increase (if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not
- 114 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
apply) as a result of the PIRP T ransfer Participant becoming eligible for early retirement under PIRP-DB, then
the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s retirement under PIRP-
DB, which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP , shall result in an appropriate increase, determined in the
Company’ s discretion, in the Participant’ s benefit under this Plan that is payable at the time and in the form
applicable under this Plan. The appropriate increase shall be determined net of any expected increase in the
value of the benefit under this Plan related to becoming eligible for Early Retirement under this Plan. In addition,
a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s appropriate increase shall be determined in a way that avoids any duplication of
benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying
Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or an af filiate, but
without applying any of fset that would violate Code Section 409A.
C.6    Alternative Arrangements Permitted :
Notwithstanding any provision of this Article or the Plan to the contrary , the Company and a Participant who
would qualify as an International T ransfer Participant under Section C.2 above may agree in writing to disregard the

that such individual is reemployed by the Company on or after May 1, 2009, into a position that is classified as Band 4
(or its equivalent) or higher . For purposes of determining such Participant’ s Total Pension within the meaning of Section
5.1(c)(1), but not for purposes of determining such Participant’ s Salaried Plan Pension within the meaning of Section
5.1(c)(2), such Participant’ s position on reemployment will be deemed to be classified as below Band 4 (or its
equivalent), so that the Participant’ s transfer is eligible to be treated as an Eligible T ransfer (subject to the other
conditions thereof) and the Participant is eligible for the imputed service provisions of Section TRI.4(b) and (c). Such
Participant’ s benefit otherwise shall be subject to the Plan’ s usual conditions and shall be paid in accordance with the

APPENDIX ARTICLE F - 
U.K. Supplementary Appendix Participants with U.S. Service
F.1    Scope :
This Article applies to “Covered U.K. Employees” as defined in Section F .2 below . The benefit of a Covered U.K.
Employee shall be determined as provided in Section F .3 below . Once a benefit is determined for a Covered U.K.
Employee under this Article, it shall be paid in accordance with the Plan’ s normal terms regarding the time and form of
payment. All benefits payable under this Article are subject to Code section 409A. This Article has been restated
effective January 1, 2016 (the original version of this Article was ef fective January 1, 2011, and it applied, in
accordance with its prior terms, to periods of service before January 1, 2016).
F.2    “Covered U.K. Employee” Defined :
A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i)
becomes subject to United States income taxes, e.g., by transferring to a position with the Company in the United
States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S. Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the
unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv)
subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B)
terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant
commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined
- 123 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
in the Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by the Company (in its
completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally binding right to a benefit
under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service shall
begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S. Commencement Date”), and it
shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or , if earlier , the date his Plan benefits under this
Article F commence (his “U.S. Cessation Date”).
F.3    Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees :
A Covered U.K. Employee’ s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S.
Cessation Date, his “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K.
Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’ s—
(a)    “Modified U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject to
U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F .2, (iii) the date he commences an
assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States (as defined in the Code), or
(iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.
(b)    “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms of
the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the
Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted in the calculation of his benefit under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under
- 124 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
U.K. law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date
his benefits under this Article F commence, and
(c)    “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the
U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such
total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this
Article F commence.
The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth in
Section F .4 below .
F.4    Operating Rules:
The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F .3. above.
(a)    In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section F .3.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F .3 to the contrary , to the extent a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee’ s U.S.
Cessation Date have more than fully of fset the Covered U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been of fset against the benefit under this Article
F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the date
benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be of fset against the
benefits under this Article F to the extent such of fset would not violate Code Section 409A.
- 125 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F , the actuarial assumptions that are used
shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section 417(e) of the Code and, specifically , are the Code
Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the PepsiCo Salaried Employees Retirement Plan to pay
a retirement lump sum as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be determined under this
Article F .
(c)    A Covered U.K. Employee’ s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis of
assuming that the Covered U.K. employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service relationship
with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date.
(d)    This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary
Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F .3
calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year . In this case, to
the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F .3 shall be
made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively ef fective starting with the
immediately following year .
(e)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a
Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service, the foregoing terms shall be applied again to
determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any resulting
benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any
- 126 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
(f)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would be
eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then the
Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new
period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump
sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
F.5    No Other Benefits :
A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while
he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F .2.
were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In addition, prior to the time that an individual has
satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally binding right
to a benefit under this Article F . Accordingly , for the avoidance of doubt, at any point before such time, the Company
may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F ( e.g., by deciding
that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’ s
discretion), regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time, and
regardless of any other factor .

sex marriage and the Participant has entered into a same-sex civil union that is valid on the
applicable date in the state in which it was entered into, the Participant’ s Eligible Domestic Partner
(if any) is the individual with whom the Participant has entered into such a same-sex civil union. If

the following: If on the applicable date the Participant has entered into a same-sex marriage that is valid on
- 131 -

term “Eligible Domestic Partner” does not apply to an individual who is of the opposite sex of the Participant.
A Participant who lives in a state that permits same-sex marriage is not permitted to have an Eligible
Domestic Partner . In the case of applicable dates prior to January 1, 2016, if the Participant’ s state started to
permit same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions less than 12 months before the applicable date, the
Participant is treated as residing in a state that does not permit same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions,
as the case may be, for purposes of this definition of Eligible Domestic Partner .
f)Defined T erms . For purposes of the definition of “Eligible Domestic Partner” in this Article H, the following

APPENDIX ARTICLE I
409A PEP Makeup for Certain Pre-409A Benefits
I.1    Scope :
To ensure there will be no “material modification” of the Pre-409A Program, this Article provides a makeup
benefit under the 409A Program that applies to certain participants in the Pre-409A Program (“Pre-409A Participants”)
in lieu of updating the Pre-409A Program’ s actuarial factors for early commencement of V ested Pensions to be
consistent with the “2019 Salaried Program Factors” (as that term is defined in the definition of Actuarial Equivalent). In
the case of participants in the Pre-409A Program who are also Participants in the 409A Program (without regard to this
Article), this makeup relating to the early commencement reduction of V ested Pensions payable as annuities is
provided under the main text of the Plan. However , this makeup is provided under this Article in the case of af fected
Pre-409A Participants who are otherwise not entitled to a benefit under the 409A Program.
I.2    Eligibility Under This Article :
To be eligible under this Article, an individual must be a Pre-409A Participant:
a)Who is paid a Pre-409A Pension that is (i) a “V ested Pension” under the Pre-409A Program, and (ii) paid in
the form of an annuity commencing as of a date prior to the Pre-409A Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date
but as of on or after January 1, 2019;
- 133 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
b)Whose Pre-409A Pension annuity under subsection (a) above is reduced for early commencement under the
terms of the Pre-409A Program by more than it would be if the early commencement reduction were
calculated using the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors; and
c)Who otherwise would not have a 409A Pension that is payable ef fective as of January 1, 2019 or later
because, except as provided in this Article, the only PEP Pension to which the individual is entitled is a Pre-
409A Pension, or because his otherwise applicable 409A Pension commenced payment as of prior to
January 1, 2019.
An individual who satisfies all of the foregoing eligibility requirements shall be referred to as an “Eligible Person”
for purposes of this Article.
I.3    Benefit Amount Under This Article :
The benefit amount for an Eligible Person under this Article shall be the single lump sum that is the Actuarial
Equivalent of the dif ference between:
a)The Single Life Annuity that would be payable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A Program as of the
Eligible Person’ s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program if the 2019 Salaried Program Factors for
early commencement applied in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with respect to any portion of
the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee), and
- 134 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
b)The Single Life Annuity that is actually applicable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A Program as of
the Eligible Person’ s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program, because of the early
commencement factors that are actually applicable in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with
respect to any portion of the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee).
Such Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be calculated as of the applicable commencement date specified in
Section I.4 below; however , if the applicable commencement date is the Section I.4(b) date ( i.e. December 1,
2019) and the Eligible Person’ s actual Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program precedes December
1, 2019, then the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be determined as of such actual Annuity Starting Date and
then brought forward with Actuarial Equivalent interest to December 1, 2019. For purposes of subsection (a)
above, the 2019 Salaried Program Factors shall be solely the new factors applicable under the Salaried Program
as of January 1, 2019 (and no alternative calculation using the factors in ef fect before January 1, 2019 shall
apply).
I.4    Time of Payment Under This Article :
The lump sum benefit calculated under this Appendix shall be payable as of the Eligible Person’ s applicable
commencement date, which is the latest of the following:
a)The first of the month following the Eligible Person’ s Separation from Service,
b)December 1, 2019, or
- 135 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
c)The first of the month following the Eligible Person’ s attainment of age 55 (except that this subsection (c)
shall not apply to the extent that the Eligible Person’ s benefit is derived from Article PBG of this Appendix).
In the event that the Eligible Person’ s applicable commencement date is the date in subsection (a) above, then
the date of actual payment of the benefit shall be delayed to the extent provided by Section 6.6(a) of the main
text of the Plan, and in the case of such a delay , the benefit determined as of such applicable commencement
date shall be increased by interest for the period of delay as provided in Section 6.6(c) of the main text of the
Plan.
I.5    Non-Duplication of Benefits :
The foregoing Sections of this Article are intended to provide a make-up benefit under the 409A Program for
applying an early commencement reduction under the Pre-409A Program using factors that predate the 2019 Salaried
Plan Factors, with respect to a Pre-409A Pension that is paid in the form of an annuity and that has an Annuity Starting
Date of January 1, 2019 or later . However , no duplication of benefits may occur at any time under the Plan. Therefore,
to the extent an Eligible Person has received or will receive a 409A Pension that, without regard to this Article,
effectively provides some or all of such makeup ( e.g., because the Eligible Person’ s 409A Pension was reduced for
early commencement using Early Retirement reduction factors), or to the extent that the Plan Administrator concludes
that providing the makeup under this Article would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits, the makeup benefit
under this Article shall be reduced (but not below zero) as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate
- 136 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
to eliminate all duplication of benefits. This provision shall govern over any contrary provision of this Article or the Plan
that might be interpreted to support a duplication of benefits.

APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG
Effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2011, the PBG PEP is hereby merged with and into the PepsiCo
PEP, with the PepsiCo PEP as the surviving plan after the merger . The following Appendix Article PBG governs PBG

(Administration), VIII (Miscellaneous), IX (Amendment and T ermination), X (ERISA Plan Structure) and XI (Applicable
Law) of the main section of this document shall govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP
Document, and (ii) ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor ,

409A PBG PEP Document when it was incorporated into this Appendix.
ARTICLE I T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - HIST ORY AND PURPOSE
1.1    History of Plan . The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP”
or “Plan”) ef fective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the
PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to
the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’ s April 6, 1999 initial public of fering, and the Plan included
- 138 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan
provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan provides benefits for certain eligible employees
based on the pre-1989 
Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009, the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under
the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral
Program and for certain executives who would be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their
classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP (or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Ef fective T ime). The Plan is
intended as a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the
Plan that provides benefits based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is
intended to be an “excess benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended
to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of
management or highly-compensated employees.
The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement
effective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG with
and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company , Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”),
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company and Pepsi-
- 139 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Cola Metropolitan Company , Inc., and to facilitate the Company’ s assumption of PBG’ s role as the Plan’ s sponsor .
1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement . The Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the
Prior Plan.
Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’ s benefit (including death
benefits), determined under the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 as if the Participant had terminated
employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid or services rendered after 2004, or any
other events af fecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than the Participant’ s survival or the
Participant’ s election under the terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of benefit) (the “Grandfathered
Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004.
The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by the
Prior Plan and this Plan, less the Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as
provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan ef fective
January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not commenced
receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith interpretation of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from January 1, 2005
through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this Plan after 2004 shall be treated as payable under a separate
Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

the minimum number of a service recipient’ s specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for
identifying Specified Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together , would result in more than 200
individuals being counted as Specified Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of
individuals treated as Specified Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first
sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees
otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the

4.1    PEP Pension . Subject to Sections 4.5 and 8.7, a Participant’ s PEP Pension shall equal the amount
determined under (a) or (b) of this Section 4.1, whichever is applicable. Such amount shall be determined as of the
date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(a)    Same Form as Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in the same form and will
commence as of the same time as his pension under the Salaried Plan, then his monthly PEP Pension shall be
equal to the excess of:
(1)    The greater of:
(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under
the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415 Limitation;
(III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under the
EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011; and (IV) the April 1, 2009 through
December 31, 2010 exclusion from the Salaried Plan definition of a Grandfathered Participant of a

was at least 65; and
(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in such
form and payable as of such time; over

- 151 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
(b)    Different Form than Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in a dif ferent form
(whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a dif ferent time than his pension benefit under the Salaried
Plan, his PEP Pension shall be the product of:

(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under
the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415 Limitation;
(III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under the
EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011; and (IV) the March 31, 2009 through

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(2)    A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1),
reduced by the value of his pension under the Salaried Plan, and the denominator of which is the value of
the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1) (with value determined on a reasonable and consistent basis,
in the discretion of the Plan Administrator , with respect to similarly situated employees).
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event any portion of the accrued benefit of a Participant under this Plan
or the Salaried Plan is awarded to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order , as such
terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, the Participant’ s total PEP Pension shall be adjusted, as the
Plan Administrator shall determine, so that the combined benefit payable to the Participant and the alternate
payee from this Plan and the Salaried Plan is the amount determined pursuant to subsections 4.1(a) and (b)
above, as applicable.
4.2    PEP Guarantee . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be
entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below , if any .
(a)    Eligibility . A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable
earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings”
means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year that was recognized for benefit accrual
received under the Salaried
- 153 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity attributable
to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under
paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this paragraph shall be
determined as follows:
(i)    Three percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the first 10
years of Credited Service, plus
(ii)    One percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each year of
Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(iii)    One and two-thirds percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension, the PEP Guarantee shall first be calculated on the
basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited
Service until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Primary
Social Security Amount at the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such Participant
ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan, and then shall be
reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’ s
actual years of Credited Service on the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such
Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and
- 154 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
this Plan and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he
continued to accrue Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age.
(2)    Calculation . The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph
(1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity : Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner and has commenced receipt of an Annuity under this
section, the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a
survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no
corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to
the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable
under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is
- 155 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.
This subparagraph applies only to a Participant who retires on or after his Early Retirement
Date.
(ii)    Reductions . The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee.
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement
Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced
to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if payment
commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the Salaried Plan for any
- 156 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the
surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner , that is greater than that provided under
subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be
reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial
Equivalent of the PEP Guarantee otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so
that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a
Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity form
that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan. In this instance, the Participant’ s
PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on
the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.
- 157 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion . The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for
a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the
Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under this section, taking into
account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement
reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
(iv)    April 1, 2009 Salaried Plan Changes.
(A)    The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant
who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and who had attained age
50 and completed five years of Service or (inclusively) whose sum of his age and years of Service
was at least 65 shall be determined as if such Participant were a Grandfathered Participant in the
Salaried Plan on April 1, 2009 (so that Earnings and Credited Service were not frozen as of March
31, 2009 for the period April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010).
(B)    Highest A verage Monthly Earnings shall be determined without regard to the exclusion
from Earnings under the Salaried Plan of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under
the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011.
4.3    Certain Adjustments . Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to
adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a
nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a
member of the PBG
- 158 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar plans includes the
PepsiCo Prior Plan).
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants . This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan
would have been recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have
been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant was
not classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP . In such event, the Participant’ s PEP Pension shall
be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-service
distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by
taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans . If the benefit paid under a specified plan
on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the
increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the
PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder ,
the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically
intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
(c)    No Benefit Offsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . If a Participant has earned a benefit under a
plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo/PBG Organization
- 159 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan
and the “T ransfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and
Non-Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)(1) or 4.1(b)(1)
above (as applicable) only to the extent the application of such rule will not result in a change in the time or form
of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on of fsets in the
preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the
payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan, and
compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent
possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into ef fect in a particular
situation, the limit on of fsets in the prior sentence will not apply .
4.4    Reemployment of Certain Participants . In the case of a current or former Participant who is reemployed
and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non-Grandfathered
PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service after such
reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the present value of
PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
4.5    Vesting; Misconduct . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at
the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or any
other provision of the Plan to the contrary , a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan
Administrator
- 160 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
determines that such Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below , determined without regard to whether
the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant’ s Severance from Service. The Plan Administrator may , in its
sole discretion, require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the Participant within the twelve
month period immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in such Misconduct, as determined
by the Plan Administrator .
“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of
any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating to
the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, licensors
or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the Company or Employer ,
including but not limited to violation of the Company’ s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or attempting to cause
any other person to make, any statement (whether written, oral or electronic), or conveying any information about the
Company or Employer which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company or Employer
unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy; (iv) improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing
any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer; (v) unlawful trading in the securities of the Company
or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that Participant’ s employment or other relationship
with the Company; (vi) engaging in any act which is considered to be contrary to the best interests of the Company or
Employer , including but not limited to recruiting or soliciting employees of the Employer; or (vii) commission of a felony
or other serious crime or engaging in any activity which constitutes gross misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and for the avoidance of
- 161 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government authorities concerning
any possible legal violations.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over
any information appropriately protected by the privilege.

anniversary of the Participant’ s initial employment date, shall receive his PEP Pension in excess of his
Grandfathered Benefit in the form elected commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or
next following his Separation from Service. If such Participant Separates from Service prior to July 1,
2009 or prior to attainment of age 55 and the tenth anniversary of the Participant’ s employment date, or
prior to attainment of age 65 and the fifth anniversary of the Participant’ s employment, the Participant’ s
PEP Pension in excess of his Grandfathered Pension shall be payable in a Single Lump Sum on the
Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(3)    2008 Reorganization . The entire PEP Pension of a Participant who (i) was involuntarily

- 165 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
until at least six (6) months after such a Separation from Service. Any payment otherwise due in such six

time. If the Participant dies after such election becomes ef fective but before his non-Grandfathered PEP
Pension actually
- 166 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
commences, the election shall be given ef fect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse,
surviving Eligible Domestic Partner or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month
following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of
a Participant who elected a 10 Y ear Certain and Life Annuity , if such Participant dies: (i) after benefits
have commenced; (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120
payments under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall
be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a
Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed,
then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
(b)    Beneficiary Other Than Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner . If a Participant’ s
beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , he may not elect:
(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.1(b)(2) with a beneficiary more than
10 years younger than he is, or
(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.1(b)(2) with a beneficiary more than 19
years younger than he is.
6.3    Designation of Beneficiary . A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of
payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his
death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form. A Participant shall have the right to change or revoke
his beneficiary
- 167 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
designation at any time prior to when his election is finally ef fective. The designation of any beneficiary , and any
change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A beneficiary
designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator
6.4    Determination of Single Lump Sum Amounts . Except as otherwise provided below , a Single Lump Sum
payable under Article V or Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option
prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan.
(a)    Vested Pensions . If on the date of Separation from Service of a Participant such Participant is not
entitled to retire with an immediate pension under the Salaried Plan, the Single Lump Sum payable to the
Participant under Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option
prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan but substituting (for Plan Y ears beginning before 2012) the
applicable segment rates for the blended 30 year T reasury and segment rates that would otherwise be
applicable.
(b)    2008 Reorganization . Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Single Lump Sum payment for a
Participant whose employment was involuntarily terminated as a result of the 2008 Reorganization on or after
November 1, 2008 and on or before December 19, 2008 shall be determined based on the applicable interest
rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for optional lump sum distributions in December 2008, provided
that in no event shall such Single Lump Sum payment be less than the Single Lump Sum determined based on
the applicable interest rates and mortality used
- 168 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
by the Salaried Plan for lump sum distributions for the month in which the Single Lump Sum is distributed to the
Participant.
6.5    Section 162(m) Postponement . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , no PEP
Pension shall be paid to any Participant prior to the earliest date on which the Company’ s federal income tax deduction
for such payment is not precluded by Section 162(m) of the Code. In the event any payment is delayed solely as a
result of the preceding restriction, such payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the first
date as of which Section 162(m) of the Code no longer precludes the deduction by the Company of such payment.
Amounts deferred because of the Section 162(m) deduction limitation shall be increased by simple interest for the
period of delay at the annual rate of six percent (6%).

Article I – INTRODUCTION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") established the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program (the “Plan”) to permit Eligible Directors
to defer certain compensation paid to them as Directors.
The Plan consists of two primary components, each of which is subject to separate documentation: (i) deferrals under the
Plan that were earned and vested prior to the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear (the “Pre-409A Program”), and (ii) and deferrals under
the Plan that were not earned and vested prior to the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear (the “409A Program”). The 409A Program is
governed by this document. The Pre-409A Program is governed by a separate set of documents. Except as otherwise provided
herein, this document reflects the provisions in ef fect from and after January 1, 2005 (the “Ef fective Date”), and the rights and
benefits of individuals who are Participants in the Plan from and after that date (and of those claiming through or on behalf of such
individuals) shall be governed by the provisions of this document in the case of actions and events occurring on or after January 1,
2005, with respect to deferrals that are subject to the 409A Program. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “actions and
events” shall include all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and benefits with respect to persons who only participated
in the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Pre-409A Program documents that were
in effect at such time, and shall not be governed by the 409A Program documents.
The Plan was restated on March 10, 201 1. This restatement amended the Plan’ s rules regarding installment payment options
by (i) adding a 10-year installment payment option to the Plan, and (ii) eliminating the prohibition on the payment of installments
after a Participant has attained age 80. The restatement also extended the minimum deferral period for elective deferrals to the first
day of the Plan Y ear following the date that is 12 months after the date the Director Compensation would otherwise be payable to
the Participant. All of these changes were ef fective for deferral elections made on and after March 1 1, 201 1.
The document for the 409A Program was restated as of September 19, 2012. This restatement reflected changes in the
Company’ s payment of Retainer Compensation, which shifted from payment annually in advance (on each October 1) to
semiannually in arrears (with the first payment in arrears to be made in December 2013 for services as a Director during the period
June 1, 2013 to November 30, 2013).
The document for the 409A Program was restated as of February 2, 2017. This restatement reflected the shift in
responsibility of reviewing and reportin g on director compensation from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to
the Compensation Committee approved by the Board of Directors on November 17, 2016.
The docum ent for the 4049A Program was restated as of December 20, 2017, to reflect the Company’ s transferring its stock
exchange listing from the New Y ork Stock Exchange to The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
The document for the 409A Program was most recently restated effective as of January 1, 2020. This restatement changed
the 409A Program’ s rules for Second Look Elections to permit an
1
unlimited number of Second Look Elections ef fective for Second Look Elections made on or after January 1, 2020.
Together , the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single
plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall
be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the
separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to permit the Pre-409A Program
to remain exempt from Section 409A and the administration of the Plan shall be consistent with this intent.
For federal income tax purposes, the Plan is intended to be a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan that is
unfunded and unsecured. For purposes of ERISA, the Plan is intended to be exempt from ERISA coverage as a plan that solely
benefits non-employees (or alternatively , a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits
to a select group of management or highly compensated employees).

her Retainer Compensation for an applicable period in the manner described in Section 4.02. Such election to defer shall apply to
Retainer Compensation in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below , whichever applies as of the time in question.
(1)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning on or after October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a
Director joining the Board after 201 1), a Director ’s deferral election shall apply to Retainer Compensation that, in the
absence of a deferral election, would be paid to the Director during a single calendar year . A newly Eligible Director may
only defer the portion of his or her Retainer Compensation, which otherwise would be payable in the calendar year in which
he or she becomes an Eligible Director , to the extent that it is earned for services performed after the date of his or her
election. For this purpose, if a valid Election Form is received prior to the date on which the Eligible Director becomes a
Director and the Election Form is ef fective under Section 4.02 as of the date on which the Eligible Director becomes a
Director , then the Director shall be deemed to earn all of his or her Retainer Compensation for the calendar year in which he
or she becomes an Eligible Director after the date of the election; otherwise, only Retainer Compensation earned for months
that begin after when the newly Eligible Director ’s Election Form is received are subject to deferral. Any Retainer
Compensation deferred by an Eligible Director for a calendar year will be deducted on each payment date during the
calendar year for which he or she has Retainer Compensation and is an Eligible Director . In accordance with the default rule
in Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-2(a)(13), Retainer Compensation that is paid – (i) following the end of a calendar year (in

joining the Board after 201 1), a Director ’s deferral election shall apply to Retainer Compensation that is earned for services
performed in the corresponding Compensation Y ear. A newly Eligible Director may only defer the portion of his or her
eligible Retainer Compensation for the Compensation Y ear in which he or she becomes an Eligible Director that is earned
for services performed after the date of his or her election. For this purpose, if a valid Election Form is received prior to the
date on which the Eligible Director becomes a Director and the Election Form is ef fective under Section 4.02 as of the date
on which the Eligible Director becomes a Director , then the Director shall be deemed to receive all of his or her Retainer
Compensation for the Compensation Y ear in which he or she becomes an Eligible Director after the date of the election.
Any Retainer Compensation deferred by an Eligible Director for a Compensation Y ear will be deducted for each payment
period during the Compensation Y ear for which he or she has Retainer Compensation and is an Eligible Director . Retainer
12
Compensation paid after the end of a Compensation Y ear for services performed during such initial Compensation Y ear
shall be treated as Director Compensation for services performed during such initial Compensation Y ear.

to be deferred and any other information that may be requested by the Plan Administrator from time to time. In addition, the
Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 4.02.

election must be made by the first business day following November 15 of such year . A newly Eligible Director may submit
an Election Form (i) prior to becoming an Eligible Director , or (ii) on or after becoming an Eligible Director , but any form
submitted must be received within 30 days of when he or she first becomes an Eligible Director (and such Election Form
will be ef fective immediately upon receipt or , if later , the commencement of the individual’ s status as an Eligible Director).

by the time prescribed in subsection (a)(1) above, the Eligible Director will be deemed to have elected not to defer any
Retainer Compensation for the applicable calendar year . Except as provided in the next sentence, an election is irrevocable
once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed (and such determination shall be made
not later than the last date for making the election in question). Increases or decreases in the amount or percentage an
Eligible Director elects to defer for a calendar year shall not be permitted from and after the beginning of the calendar year
to which the deferral election applies (or in the case of a Newly Eligible Director ’s first calendar year , from and after the
effective date of his or her deferral election for such calendar year). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if an Eligible
Director receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency pursuant to Section 6.06, the Plan Administrator
may cancel the Eligible Director ’s deferral election for the calendar year in which such distribution occurs. If an election is
cancelled because of a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , such cancellation shall permanently apply to
the deferral election for such calendar year , and the Director may be eligible to make a new deferral election only for a
subsequent calendar year (and only as permitted by the rules in Sections 4.01 and 4.02).

Election Form is not actually received by the Plan Administrator (or , if authorized by the Plan Administrator for this
purpose, the Recordkeeper) by the time prescribed in subsection (a)(2) above, the Eligible Director will be deemed to have
elected not to defer any Retainer Compensation for the applicable Compensation Y ear. Except as provided in the next
sentence, an election is irrevocable once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed (and
such determination shall be made not later than the last date for making the election in question). Increases or decreases in
the amount or percentage an Eligible Director elects to defer shall not be permitted from and after the beginning of the
calendar year during which the applicable Compensation Y ear begins (or in the case of a Newly Eligible Director ’s first
Compensation Y ear, from and after the date he or she becomes an Eligible Director); provided that if an Eligible Director
receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency pursuant to Section 6.06, the Plan Administrator may
cancel the Eligible Director ’s deferral election for the year in which such distribution occurs. If an election is cancelled
because of a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , such cancellation shall permanently apply to the
deferral election for such year , and the Director may be eligible to make a new deferral election only for a subsequent year
(and only as permitted by the rules in Sections 4.01 and 4.02).

(c)    Beneficiaries . A Participant may designate on the Election Form (or in some other manner authorized by the
Plan Administrator) one or more Beneficiaries to receive payment, in the event of his or her death, of the amounts credited to his or
her Account; provided that, to be ef fective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and must
meet such other standards (including any requirement for spousal consent) as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to
time. The Beneficiary designation must also be filed with the Plan Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan
Administrator for this purpose) prior to the Participant’ s death. An incomplete Beneficiary designation, as determined by the Plan
Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose), shall be void and of no ef fect. In
determining whether a Beneficiary designation that relates to the Plan is in ef fect, unrevoked designations that were received under
the Pre-409A Program or prior to the Ef fective Date shall be considered. A Beneficiary designation of an individual by name
remains in ef fect regardless of any change in the designated individual’ s relationship to the Participant. Any Beneficiary
designation submitted to the Plan Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose) that
only specifies a Beneficiary by relationship shall not be considered an ef fective Beneficiary designation and shall be void and of no
effect. If more than one Beneficiary is specified and the Participant fails to indicate the respective percentage applicable to two or
more Beneficiaries, then each Beneficiary for whom a percentage is not designated will be entitled to an equal share of the portion
of the Account (if any) for which percentages have not been designated. At any time, a Participant may change a Beneficiary
designation for his or her Account in a writing that is signed by the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator (or
Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose) prior to the Participant’ s death, and that meets such other
standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time. An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary with respect to a
Participant’ s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all payments have been made from the Account.
4.03     Period of Deferral; Form of Payment :
(a)    Period of Deferral . An Eligible Director making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his or
her Election Form by designating either a Specific Payment Date or the date he or she incurs a Separation from Service. Solely for
elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible Director ’s Specific Payment Date shall not be later than his or her 80th birthday
(and the specification of such a later date shall be deemed instead to specify the Director ’s 80th birthday as the Specific Payment
Date). In addition, an Eligible Director shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than the first day of the Plan
Year after (i) for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, the date that is 12 months after the date the Retainer Compensation
would have been paid absent the deferral, and (ii) for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, the end of the Plan Y ear during
which the Director Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral. If the Specific Payment Date selected by an Eligible
Director would result in a period of deferral that is less than the minimum, the Eligible Director shall be deemed to have selected a
Specific Payment Date equal to the minimum period of deferral as provided in the preceding sentence. If an Eligible Director fails
to affirmatively designate a period of deferral on his or her Election Form, he or she shall be deemed to have specified the date on
which he or she incurs a Separation from Service.
15
(b)    Form of Payment . This subsection (b) is ef fective for elective deferral elections filed for Compensation Y ears
beginning from and after October 1, 2009; see the Appendix for rules applicable prior to that date.
(1)    Elections on or After March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, an
Eligible Director making a deferral election shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by designating
either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 or 10 years.
(2)    Elections Prior to March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible
Director making a deferral election shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by designating either a
lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 years but not later than the Eligible
Director ’s 80th birthday . If the Eligible Director elects installment payments and the installments would otherwise extend
beyond the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday , such election shall be treated as an election for installments over a period of
whole and partial years that ends on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday; provided that the amounts to be distributed in
connection with the installments prior to the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday shall be determined in accordance with
Section 6.08 by assuming that the installments shall continue for the full number of installments with the entire remaining
amount of the relevant Deferral Subaccount distributed on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday .
If an Eligible Director fails to make a form of payment election for a deferral under paragraphs (1) or (2) above, he or she shall be
deemed to have elected a lump sum payment. Initial form of payment elections for Mandatory Deferrals are governed by Section
4.05.
4.04     Second Look Election :
(a)    General . Subject to subsection (b) below and the next two sentences, a Participant who has made a valid
initial deferral in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Article may subsequently make additional elections regarding the
time and/or form of payment of his or her deferral. This opportunity to modify the Participant’ s initial election is referred to as a
“Second Look Election.” For periods before January 1, 2020, a Participant was eligible to make only one Second Look Election
with respect to each individual deferral under the Plan.
(b)    Requirements for Second Look Elections . A Second Look Election must be made on an Election Form that
the Plan Administrator provides for this purpose, and it must comply with all of the following requirements:
(1)    If a Participant’ s initial election for a deferral (or the latest subsequent Second Look Election)
specified payment based on a Specific Payment Date, the Participant may only change the payment terms for such deferral
through a Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s original (or if applicable,
last subsequently elected) Specific Payment Date. In addition, in this
16
case the Participant’ s Second Look Election must provide for a new Specific Payment Date that is at least five years after
the original (or if applicable, last subsequently elected) Specific Payment Date. For Second Look Elections made prior to
March 1 1, 201 1, if the Specific Payment Date applicable pursuant to the Second Look Election was after the Participant’ s
80th birthday , either by the Participant’ s choice or if necessary to comply with the five-year rule stated above, the Second
Look Election was void.
(2)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment based on the Participant’ s Separation from
Service, which for purposes of this Section excludes Death or Disability , the Participant may only make a Second Look
Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s Separation from Service. In addition, in this case
each Second Look Election by a Participant must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral for at least five years. For
example, the Second Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral to a new Specific Payment Date
that turns out to be at least five years after the later of (i) the payment date for the Participant’ s Separation from Service that
is applicable under Section 6.03(b) or (ii) the last Specific Payment Date following the Participant’ s Separation from
Service that was designated in a prior Second Look Election. If the new Specific Payment Date selected in the Second Look
Election turns out to be less than five years after the payment date for the Participant’ s Separation from Service that is
applicable under Section 6.03(b), the Second Look Election is void.
(3)    Neither a Separation from Service nor a period of delay after a Separation from Service may be
specified as the payout date resulting from a Second Look Election.
(4)    To the extent permitted by subsection (a) above, a Participant may make an unlimited number of
Second Look Elections for each individual deferral, but each Second Look Election must comply with all of the relevant
requirements of this Section.
(5)    A Participant who uses a Second Look Election to change the form of the Participant’ s payment from
a lump sum to installments shall be subject to the rules for installment payment elections in Sections 4.03(b)(1) and (2), and
such installment payments must begin no earlier than five years after when the lump sum payment would have been paid
based upon the Participant’ s initial election (or if applicable, the Participant’ s subsequent Second Look Election)
(6)    If a Participant’ s initial election (or if applicable, the Participant’ s Second Look Election) specified
payment in the form of installments and the Participant wants to elect installment payments over a greater or lesser number
of years, the election will be subject to the provisions of the Plan regarding installment payment elections in Section 4.03(b)
(1) and (2), and the first payment date of the new installment payment schedule must be no earlier than five years after the
first payment date that applied under the Participant’ s initial (or , if applicable, subsequent) installment election..
17
(7)    If a Participant’ s initial (or if applicable, the Participant’ s Second Look Election) election specified
payment in the form of installments and the Participant wants to elect instead payment in a lump sum, the earliest payment
date of the lump sum must be no earlier than five years after the first payment date that applied under the Participant’ s
initial (or , if applicable, subsequent) installment election.
(8)    For purposes of this Section and compliance with Section 409A, all of a Participant’ s installment
payments related to a specific deferral election shall be treated as a single payment.
A Second Look Election will be void and payment will be made based on the Participant’ s original election under Section
4.03 if all of the relevant provisions of this subsection (b) are not satisfied in full. However , if a Participant’ s Second Look Election
becomes ef fective in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (b), the Participant’ s original (or , if applicable, subsequent)
election shall be superseded (including any Specific Payment Date specified therein), and the original (or , if applicable, subsequent)
election shall not be taken into account with respect to the deferral that is subject to the ef fective and superseding Second Look
Election.
(c)    Plan Administrator ’s Role . Each Participant has the sole responsibility to elect a Second Look Election by
contacting the Plan Administrator (or , if authorized by the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper) and to comply with the
requirements of this Section. The Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may provide a notice of a Second Look Election
opportunity to some or all Participants, but the Recordkeeper and Plan Administrator is under no obligation to provide such notice
(or to provide it to all Participants, in the event a notice is provided only to some Participants). The Recordkeeper and the Plan
Administrator have no discretion to waive or otherwise modify any requirement for a Second Look Election set forth in this Section
or in Section 409A.
4.05     Mandatory Deferrals :
(a)    General . As provided in this Section, the Board of Directors of the Company may require that Director
Compensation be deferred under the Plan. Such portion of an Eligible Director ’s Director Compensation that the Board of Directors
of the Company requires to be deferred under this Section 4.05 shall be referred to as a “Mandatory Deferral.”
(b)    Time for Committee’ s Determination . To be ef fective hereunder , any determination by the Board of Directors
of the Company to require a Mandatory Deferral of a portion of an Eligible Director ’s Director Compensation must be made no
later than the December 31 immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Eligible Director performs the services to which
such Director Compensation relates (or , to the extent the Eligible Director is not permitted to make any payment election with
respect to such Mandatory Deferral and it would result in a later deadline, immediately prior to the time the Eligible Director first
has a legally binding right to such Director Compensation). As of such date or time, the determination by the Board of Directors of
the Company to require the deferral of the Director Compensation shall be irrevocable. Any Mandatory Deferral shall be credited to
a separate Deferral Subaccount that is maintained for such Mandatory Deferral.
18
(c)    Current Mandatory Deferrals . Pursuant to a September 14, 2007 resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Company , a Mandatory Deferral of $150,000 shall be credited as of October 1 of each year to each individual who is an Eligible
Director on such October 1, commencing with a Mandatory Deferral on October 1, 2007; provided that (1) a Director newly
appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company shall be credited with a pro-rated Mandatory Deferral as of the
commencement date of his or her status as a Director , with such pro-rated amount determined by multiplying such Mandatory
Deferral by the ratio of the number of full and partial quarters remaining during the Applicable 12-Month Period (as defined below)
as of such commencement date over four , and (2) the Board of Directors of the Company retains the discretion to change the
amount subject to Mandatory Deferral or eliminate Mandatory Deferrals entirely with respect to Applicable 12-Month Periods after
the 2007-2008 Compensation Y ear. At the same time, any such discretion shall not alter the determination to defer Director
Compensation to the extent such determination has become irrevocable with respect to specific Director Compensation in
accordance with subsection (b) above. However , the preceding sentence shall not limit the discretion of the Company’ s Board of
Directors to forfeit outright specific Director Compensation. For purposes of this Section, “Applicable 12-Month Period” shall
mean the 12-month period that begins on October 1 of a year and ends on September 30 of the following year .
(d)    Time and Form of Payment . Each Mandatory Deferral shall be distributed in accordance with Section 6.07.
The Eligible Director shall specify the form of payment of each of his or her Mandatory Deferrals in accordance with the
following:
(1)    Elections on or After March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, an
Eligible Director shall designate either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 or
10 years.
(2)    Elections Prior to March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible
Director shall designate either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 years.
Installments are not available if the first installment would begin on or after the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday . If the
Eligible Director elects installment payments and the installments would otherwise begin before and extend beyond the
Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday , such election shall be treated as an election for installments over a period of whole and
partial years that ends on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday; provided that the amounts to be distributed in connection
with the installments prior to the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.08 by
assuming that the installments shall continue for the full number of installments, with the entire remaining amount of the
relevant Deferral Subaccount distributed on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday . No such election shall be permitted for the
Mandatory Deferral for the 2007-2008 Compensation Y ear.
If permitted under paragraphs (1) or (2) above, an Eligible Director shall make a form of payment election with respect to a
Mandatory Deferral no later than December 31 immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Eligible Director provides the
services to which the Mandatory Deferral relates (although the Plan Administrator may adopt policies that encourage or require
earlier submission of election forms). In addition, an individual shall not be eligible to
19
make a form of payment election for a Mandatory Deferral granted to an individual for his first Applicable 12-Month Period as an
Eligible Director , unless such individual submits the election prior to becoming an Eligible Director or otherwise prior to rendering
services as an Eligible Director , and then such election shall be ef fective immediately upon commencement of the individual’ s
status as an Eligible Director or otherwise upon commencement of his or her services as an Eligible Director . If an Eligible Director
does not (or is not permitted to) make a form of payment election for a Mandatory Deferral, the Mandatory Deferral shall be paid in
a lump sum. On and after January 1, 2020, an Eligible Director shall be entitled to change the time and form of payment of
Mandatory Deferrals that are distributable on account of Separation from Service (other than for Disability or Death) in accordance
with Section 4.04. Prior to January 1, 2020, an Eligible Director shall be entitled to elect to change the time and form of payment in
accordance with Section 4.04 only to the extent expressly permitted by the Board of Directors.
20
Article V – INTERESTS OF P ARTICIP ANTS
5.01     Accounting for Participants’ Interests :
(a)    Deferral Subaccounts . Each Participant shall have at least one separate Deferral Subaccount for each separate
deferral of Director Compensation made by or for the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’ s deferral shall be credited as of the
date of the deferral to his or her Account as soon as administratively practicable following the date the compensation would be paid
in the absence of a deferral (or as specified in Section 4.05, in the case of a Mandatory Deferral). A Participant’ s Account is a
bookkeeping device to track the value of the Participant’ s deferrals and the Company’ s liability therefor . No assets shall be reserved
or segregated in connection with any Account, and no Account shall be insured or otherwise secured.
(b)    Account Earnings or Losses . As of each V aluation Date, a Participant’ s Account shall be credited with
earnings and gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to the Participant’ s Account
had actually been invested in accordance with this Article. The Plan provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such
earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However , they shall be applied to measure the value of a
Participant’ s Account and the amount of the Company’ s liability to make deferred payments to or on behalf of the Participant.
5.02     Phantom Investment of Account :
(a)    General . Each of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts shall be invested on a phantom basis as provided in this
Section.
(1)    Participants Who Are Currently Directors . The Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who is
currently a Director shall be invested on a phantom basis solely in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to subsection (b)
below .
(2)    All Other Participants . Not before the later of a Participant’ s diversification date (as defined below)
and March 1 1, 201 1, the Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who ceases to be a Director may be invested on a phantom
basis in any combination of phantom investment options specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’ s death,
by his or her Beneficiary) from the option in subsection (b) and those options of fered by the Plan Administrator under
subsection (c) below for this purpose from time to time. A Participant’ s diversification date shall be the first day of the
calendar quarter beginning after the first anniversary of when he or she ceases to be a Director . Prior to the later of a
Participant’ s diversification date and March 1 1, 201 1, the Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who ceases to be a Director
shall be invested on a phantom basis solely in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to subsection (b) below . The ef fective date
of an investment election that is permissible under this subsection is determined under subsection (d) below .
(3)    Participants Who Return to Director Status . If a former Director subsequently returns to Director
status, deferrals made during the period prior to his or
21
her return to Director status shall be subject to paragraph (2) above, and deferrals made during the period in which he or she
is again a Director shall be subject to paragraph (1) above.
(b)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock . Participant Accounts invested in this phantom option are adjusted to
reflect an investment in PepsiCo Common Stock. An amount deferred into this option is converted to phantom shares (or units) of
PepsiCo Common Stock of equivalent value by dividing such amount by the Fair Market V alue of a share of PepsiCo Common
Stock (or of a unit in the Account) on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan
Administrator . The Plan Administrator shall adopt a fair valuation methodology for valuing a phantom investment in this option,
such that the value shall reflect the complete value of an investment in PepsiCo Common Stock in accordance with the following
paragraphs below .
(1)    The Plan Administrator shall value a phantom investment in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to an
accounting methodology which unitizes partial shares as well as any amounts that would be received by the Account as
dividends (if dividends were paid on phantom shares/units of PepsiCo Common Stock as they are on actual shares of
equivalent value). For the time period this methodology is chosen, partial shares and the above dividends shall be converted
to units and credited to the Participant’ s investment in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock.
(2)    A Participant’ s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock is valued as of a V aluation Date by
multiplying the number of phantom shares (or units) credited to his or her Account on such date by the Fair Market V alue of
a share of PepsiCo Common Stock (or of a unit in the Account) on such date.
(3)    If shares of PepsiCo Common Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, mer ger, consolidation, spin-of f, combination or exchange of shares or any other corporate change treated as
subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator , such equitable adjustment shall be made in the number and kind of
phantom shares/units credited to an Account or Deferral Subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be
necessary or appropriate.
(4)    In no event will shares of PepsiCo Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and
no Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of PepsiCo Common Stock on account of an interest in this phantom
option.
(c)    Other Funds . From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate which (if any) other investment
options shall be available as phantom investment options under the Plan. These phantom investment options shall be described in
materials provided to Participants from time to time. Any of these phantom investment options shall be administered under
procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator . Unless otherwise specified in these materials or procedures,
in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an amount deferred or transferred into such
option is converted to phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by dividing such amount by the NA V of a unit in
such fund on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this
22
option by the Plan Administrator . Thereafter , a Participant’ s interest in each such phantom option is valued as of a V aluation Date
(or a Distribution V aluation Date) by multiplying the number of phantom units credited to his or her Account on such date by the
NAV of a unit in such fund on such date. The Plan Administrator may discontinue any phantom investment option with respect to
some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’ s phantom investment from the discontinued option to
a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another replacement option in accordance with such requirements as
the Plan Administrator may apply).
(d)    Fund T ransfers . A Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in a Deferral Subaccount (to the
extent subsection (c)’ s phantom investment options are available for such amounts) by properly completing and submitting a fund
transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper and specifying, in one percent increments, the reallocation of his
or her Deferral Subaccount among the phantom investment options then of fered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose. (The
rules relating to non-paper formats for Election Forms shall also apply to the fund transfer form.) If a fund transfer form provides
for investing less than or more than 100% of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount, it will be void and disregarded. Any transfer
form that is not void under the preceding sentence shall be ef fective as of the V aluation Date next occurring after its receipt by the
Recordkeeper , but the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper may also specify a minimum number of days in advance of which such
transfer form must be received in order for the form to become ef fective as of such next V aluation Date. If more than one fund
transfer form is received on a timely basis, the form that the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper determines to be the most recent
shall be followed.
(e)    Authority of Recordkeeper . Any valuation or other determination that is required to be made under this
Section by the Plan Administrator may also be made by the Recordkeeper , if the Recordkeeper has been authorized by the Plan
Administrator to make such valuation or determination.
(f)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund Restrictions . Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
Section, the Plan Administrator may at any time alter the ef fective date of any investment or allocation involving the Phantom
PepsiCo Common Stock Fund pursuant to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards against insider trading). The Plan Administrator
may also, to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-3(f) of the Act, arrange for tracking of any such transaction
defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(1) of the Act and bar any such transaction to the extent it would not be exempt under Rule 16b-3(f). The
Company may also impose blackout periods pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 whenever the
Company determines that circumstances warrant. Further , the Company may impose quarterly blackout periods on insider trading
in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund as needed (as determined by the Company), timed to coincide with the release of the
Company’ s quarterly earnings reports. The commencement and termination of these blackout periods in each quarter , the parties to
which they apply and the activities they restrict shall be as set forth in the of ficial insider trading policy promulgated by the
Company from time to time. These provisions shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary except Section
7.07 (relating to compliance with Section 409A).
23
5.03     Vesting of a Participant’ s Account :
A Participant’ s interest in the value of his or her Account shall at all times be 100% vested, which means that it will not
forfeit as a result of his or her Separation from Service.
5.04     Prohibited Misconduct .
(a)    Effective for Mandatory Deferrals and elective deferrals of Director Compensation that are credited to the
Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-2012 Compensation Y ear, a Participant who engages in “Prohibited Misconduct” shall, at the
sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (and in addition to any other remedies available to the Board and/or the
Company), forfeit the entire amount in his or her Account attributable to – (i) Mandatory Deferrals of Director Compensation that
are credited to the Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-2012 Compensation Y ear, including all current and future earnings and
gains thereon, and (ii) all current and future earnings and gains attributable to elective deferrals of Director Compensation that are
credited to the Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-2012 Compensation Y ear.
(b)    For purposes of subsection (a) above, “Prohibited Misconduct” shall mean: (i) the use for profit or disclosure
to unauthorized persons of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company; (ii) the breach of any contract with the
Company or violation of any obligation to the Company , including, without limitation, a violation of the Company’ s Worldwide
Code of Conduct; (iii) engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or of another company based on information
gained as a result of the Participant’ s position with the Company; or (iv) the commission of a felony or other serious crime. Nothing
contained in the Plan or in any other confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject as a result of the Participant
serving as a Director , shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal
violations without notice to the Company , participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for
providing information to government authorities.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege
over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.
24
Article VI – DISTRIBUTIONS
6.01     General :
A Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount(s) shall be distributed as provided in this Article, subject in all cases to Section 7.03(j)
(relating to safeguards against insider trading) and Section 7.06 (relating to compliance with Section 16 of the Act). All Deferral
Subaccount balances shall be distributed in cash; provided, however , that ef fective for distributions made after September 12, 2008,
the distribution of a Participant’ s interest in phantom PepsiCo Common Stock shall be paid in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock
which will be deemed to have been distributed under the PepsiCo, Inc. 2007 Long T erm Incentive Plan or any successor plan
thereto and will count against the limit on the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock available for distribution thereunder . If
the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock to be distributed is not a whole number of shares, the number of shares to be
distributed will be rounded down to the closest whole number of shares and the remaining amount will be paid in cash based on the
Fair Market V alue of a share of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Distribution V aluation Date corresponding to the distribution. In no
event shall any portion of a Participant’ s Account be distributed earlier or later than is allowed under Section 409A. The following
general rules shall apply for purposes of interpreting the provisions of this Article VI.
(a)    Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer
until a Specific Payment Date and the Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s Disability or death. If such a
Participant dies prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.04 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of
all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If such a Participant becomes Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.05 shall
apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(b)    Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies when a Participant has elected
to defer until a Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than as a result of death).
Subsections (c) and (d) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or 6.06 take precedence over Section 6.03.
(c)    Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when the Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled
to receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02 or 6.03 (see below) at the time of his or her death, Section 6.04 shall take
precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.04 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s
Account.
(d)    Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when the Participant becomes Disabled. If a
Participant who becomes Disabled dies, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.05 to the extent it would result in an
earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is receiving a distribution under
Section 6.02 or 6.03 at the time of his Disability , Section 6.05 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.05
would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
25
(e)    Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when the Participant incurs an
Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to when a Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.05. In this case, the
provisions of Section 6.06 shall take precedence over Sections 6.02 through 6.05 to the extent Section 6.06 would result in an
earlier distribution of all or part of the Participant’ s Account.
6.02     Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date :
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a
Participant’ s Specific Payment Date for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability or (ii) the
Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall be distributed based on the occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:
(a)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum pursuant to Sections 4.03 or
4.04, whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or
immediately precedes the Specific Payment Date, and the resulting amount shall be paid in a single lump sum on the Specific
Payment Date.
(b)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of installments pursuant to Section 4.03 or
4.04, whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or
immediately precedes the Specific Payment Date and the first installment payment shall be paid on the Specific Payment Date.
Thereafter , installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the Participant on the Election Form or
the Second Look Election (whichever is applicable, and subject in each case to the provisions of this Plan that constrain such
elections), except as provided in Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 (relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and
Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding
provisions of this subsection (b), if before the date the last installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant would
be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to a distribution on account of death or Disability),
the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based on such Specific
Payment Date shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or
Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the
case of Section 6.04 or 6.05.
6.03     Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service :
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon Separation from Service. When used in this Section, the
phrase “Separation from Service” shall only refer to a Separation from Service that is not for Disability or death.
(a)    If the Participant’ s Separation from Service is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a
Deferral Subaccount, the Participant’ s deferral election pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall
continue to be given
26
effect, and the Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed based upon the provisions of Section 6.02.
(b)    If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service,
distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence as follows:
(1)    for deferrals of Director Compensation other than Mandatory Deferrals, distribution of the related
Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first day of the Plan Y ear following the end of the Plan Y ear in which the
Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs; and
(2)    for Mandatory Deferrals, distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first
day of the calendar quarter beginning after the first anniversary of the Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs.
(c)    The distribution provided in subsection (b) shall be made in either a single lump sum payment or in
installment payments depending upon the Participant’ s deferral election under Sections 4.03, 4.04 or 4.05. If the Deferral
Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation
Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the resulting amount shall be
distributed in a lump sum on the date specified in subsection (b) above. If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the
form of installments pursuant to Section 4.03 or 4.04, whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the
last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and
the first installment payment shall be paid on the date specified in subsection (b) above. Thereafter , installment payments shall
continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the Participant on his/her deferral election form or Second Look Election (and
subject in each case to the provisions of this Plan that constrain such elections), except as provided in Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06
(relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be
determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection (c), if before the date the last
installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.04
or 6.05 (relating to a distribution on account of death or Disability), the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts
that would otherwise be distributed based on such Separation from Service shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section
6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would result in
an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section 6.04 or 6.05.
(d)    Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, if the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the
time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under
Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Separation from Service, earlier
than the date that is at least 6 months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service. In such event:
27
(1)    any applicable lump sum payment shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that
corresponds to the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the resulting amount
shall be distributed on the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service; and
(2)    any installment payments that would otherwise have been paid during such 6 month period shall be
valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that corresponds to the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s
Separation from Service pursuant to Section 6.08 and the resulting amount(s) shall be distributed in a lump sum on the date
that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the installment stream shall continue from
that point in accordance with the applicable schedule.
(e)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments for one or more Deferral Subaccounts in accordance with
Section 6.02 at the time of his or her Separation from Service, such installment payments shall continue to be paid based upon the
Participant’ s deferral election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 relating to distributions on account of
death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
6.04     Distributions on Account of Death :
(a)    Upon a Participant’ s death, the Participant’ s Account under the Plan shall be valued as of the first Distribution
Valuation Date of the first Plan Y ear following the Participant’ s death and the resulting amount shall be distributed in a single lump
sum payment on such date. If the Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s death, such
installment payments shall continue in accordance with the terms of the Participant’ s deferral election that governs such payments
until the time that the lump sum payment is due to be paid under the provisions of the preceding sentence of this subsection (a).
Immediately prior to the time that such lump sum payment is to be paid all installment payments shall cease and the remaining
balance of the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed at such scheduled payment time in a single lump sum. Amounts paid
following a Participant’ s death, whether a lump sum or continued installments, shall be paid to the Participant’ s Beneficiary . If
some but not all of the persons designated as Beneficiaries by a Participant to receive his or her Account at death predecease the
Participant, the Participant’ s surviving Beneficiaries shall be entitled to the portion of the Participant’ s Account intended for such
pre-deceased persons in proportion to the surviving Beneficiaries’ respective shares.
(b)    If no designation is in ef fect at the time of a Participant’ s death (as determined by the Plan Administrator) or
if all persons designated as Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section
shall be distributed as follows:
(1)    If the Participant is married at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section
shall be paid to the Participant’ s spouse; and
28
(2)    If the Participant is not married at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this
Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate.
The Plan Administrator shall determine whether a Participant is “married” and shall determine a Participant’ s “spouse” based on
the state or local law where the Participant has his/her primary residence at the time of death. The Plan Administrator is authorized
to make any applicable inquires and to request any documents, certificates or other information that it deems necessary or
appropriate in order to make the above determinations.
(c)    Prior to the time the value of the Participant’ s Account is distributed under this Section, the Participant’ s
Beneficiary may apply for a distribution under Section 6.06 (relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency).
(d)    Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’ s
death must be received by the Recordkeeper or the Plan Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is paid out by the
Recordkeeper . Any claim received thereafter is untimely , and it shall be unenforceable against the Plan, the Company , the Plan
Administrator , the Recordkeeper or any other party acting for one or more of them.
6.05     Distributions on Account of Disability :
If a Participant incurs a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Section.
(a)    Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under this Article, if a Participant believes he or
she is suf fering from a Disability , the Participant shall file a written request with the Recordkeeper for payment of the entire amount
credited to his or her Account in connection with Disability . After a Participant has filed a written request pursuant to this Section,
along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the Recordkeeper shall determine
within 45 days (or such other number of days as allowed by applicable law if special circumstances warrant additional time)
whether the Participant meets the criteria for a Disability . In addition, to the extent required under Section 409A, if the Company
becomes aware that the Participant appears to meet the criteria for a Disability , the Company shall advise the Recordkeeper and the
Recordkeeper shall proceed to determine if the Participant meets the criteria for a Disability under this Plan, even if the Participant
has yet not applied for payment from this Plan. To the extent practicable, the Participant shall be expected to permit whatever
medical examinations are necessary for the Recordkeeper to make its determination. If the Recordkeeper determines that the
Participant has satisfied the criteria for a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date
that occurs on or immediately precedes the date on which the Participant became Disabled and the resulting amount shall be
distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the Plan Y ear following the end of the Plan Y ear in which the
Disability determination is made.
(b)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s Disability , such installment
payments shall continue to be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Participant’ s applicable deferral election until the time
that the lump sum
29
payment is due to be paid under the provisions of subsection (a). Immediately prior to the time that such lump sum payment is
scheduled to be paid, all installment payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Account shall be
distributed at the time specified in subsection (a) in a single lump sum.
6.06     Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency :
Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under Sections 6.02 through 6.05, a Participant or Beneficiary
may file a written request with the Recordkeeper for accelerated payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to the
Participant’ s Account based upon an Unforeseeable Emer gency . After an individual has filed a written request pursuant to this
Section, along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the Recordkeeper shall
determine within 60 days (or such other number of days that is necessary if special circumstances warrant additional time) whether
the individual meets the criteria for an Unforeseeable Emer gency . If the Recordkeeper determines that an Unforeseeable
Emer gency has occurred, the Participant or Beneficiary shall receive a distribution from his or her Account on the date that such
determination is finalized by the Recordkeeper . However , such distribution shall not exceed the dollar amount necessary to satisfy
the Unforeseeable Emer gency (plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution) after
taking into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emer gency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant’ s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets
would not itself cause severe financial hardship).
6.07     Distributions of Mandatory Deferrals :
This Section 6.07 shall govern the distribution of all Mandatory Deferrals under the Plan. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 6.07, a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount(s) for Mandatory Deferrals shall be distributed upon the earliest of the following
to occur:
(a)    The Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than on account of a Disability or death) pursuant to the
distribution rules of Section 6.03;
(b)    The Participant’ s death pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.04;
(c)    The Participant’ s Disability pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.05; or
(d)    The occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emer gency with respect to the Participant pursuant to the distribution
rules of Section 6.06.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may specify dif ferent terms for the distribution of
Mandatory Deferrals. Such specification may always occur not later than when the Mandatory Deferral becomes irrevocable under
Section 4.05(c). Such specification may also occur later , but only to the extent that such later specification satisfies the
requirements of Section 4.04 (as if it were an election by the Participant). In addition, on and after January 1, 2020, the Participant
may change the time and form of payment of Mandatory Deferrals that are distributable on account of Separation from Service
(other than for Disability
30
or Death) in accordance with Section 4.04. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Participant may only make a Second Look Election under
Section 4.04 to the extent expressly permitted by the Board of Directors.
6.08     Valuation :
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Participant's Deferral Subaccount shall
continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the Distribution
Valuation Date that is used in determining the amount of the distribution under this Article. If a particular Section in this Article
does not specify a Distribution V aluation Date to be used in calculating the distribution, the Participant's Deferral Subaccount shall
continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the Distribution
Valuation Date on or most recently preceding the date of such distribution. In determining the value of a Participant’ s remaining
Deferral Subaccount following an installment distribution from the Deferral Subaccount (or a partial distribution under Section
6.06 relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency), such distribution shall reduce the value of the
Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of the close of the Distribution V aluation Date on or most recently preceding the payment date
for such installment (or partial distribution). The amount to be distributed in connection with any installment payment shall be
determined by dividing the value of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of such Distribution V aluation Date (determined before
reduction of the Deferral Subaccount as of such Distribution V aluation Date in accordance with the preceding sentence) by the
remaining number of installments to be paid with respect to the Deferral Subaccount.
6.09     Impact of Section 16 of the Act on Distributions :
The provisions of Section 7.06 shall apply in determining whether a Participant’ s distribution shall be delayed beyond the
date applicable under the preceding provisions of this Article VI.
6.10     Actual Payment Date :
An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI shall be paid no later than the later of (a) the end of the calendar
year in which the specified date occurs, or (b) the 15th day of the third calendar month following such specified date. In addition,
the Participant (or Beneficiary) is not permitted to designate the taxable year of the payment.
31
Article VII – PLAN ADMINISTRA TION
7.01     Plan Administrator :
The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has the authority to name
one or more delegates to carry out certain responsibilities hereunder , as specified in the definition of Plan Administrator . To the
extent not already set forth in the Plan, any such delegation shall state the scope of responsibilities being delegated and is subject to
Section 7.06 below .
7.02     Action :
Action by the Plan Administrator may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Plan Administrator adopts from time
to time or that the Company’ s Law Department determines are legally permissible.
7.03     Powers of the Plan Administrator :
The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have (and shall be permitted to delegate) all powers
necessary to accomplish that purpose, including the following:
(a)    To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b)    To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility , participation and deferrals,
to make allocations and determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants’ Accounts;
(c)    To compute and certify to the Company the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their
Beneficiaries, and to determine the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;
(d)    To authorize all disbursements by the Company pursuant to this Plan;
(e)    To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
(f)    To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms hereof;
(g)    To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the performance of any of its duties or
responsibilities hereunder;
(h)    To change the phantom investment under Article V ;
(i)    To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and administering
the Plan; and
32
(j)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan except Section 7.07 (relating to compliance with Section
409A), the Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may take any action the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to assure
compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in ef fect from time to time. Such actions may
include altering the distribution date of Deferral Subaccounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of the Plan to the
minimum extent necessary .
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be final
and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the
Plan Administrator , even if (1) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (2) a determination is
not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or call
for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the
applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal, any exercise of the Plan
Administrator ’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly shown to be arbitrary and capricious.
7.04     Compensation, Indemnity and Liability :
The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without compensation for services hereunder . All expenses of the Plan
and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Company . To the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator , any such
expense may be char ged against specific Participant Accounts, thereby reducing the obligation of the Company . No member of the
Board of Directors (who serves as the Plan Administrator), and no individual acting as the delegate of the Board of Directors, shall
be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or omission on his or her own part, excepting
his or her own willful misconduct. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Board of Directors and any
employee of the Company (or a Company af filiate, if recognized as an af filiate for this purpose by the Plan Administrator) acting as
the delegate of the Board of Directors against any and all expenses and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
arising in connection with this Plan out of his or her membership on the Board of Directors (or his or her serving as the delegate of
the Board of Directors), excepting only expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her own willful misconduct or bad faith.
7.05     Withholding :
The Company shall withhold from amounts due under this Plan, any amount necessary to enable the Company to remit to
the appropriate government entity or entities on behalf of the Participant as may be required by the federal income tax provisions of
the Code, by an applicable state’ s income tax provisions, and by an applicable city , county or municipality’ s earnings or income tax
provisions. Further , the Company shall withhold from the payroll of, or collect from, a Participant the amount necessary to remit on
behalf of the Participant any Social Security and/or Medicare taxes which may be required with respect to amounts deferred or
accrued by a
33
Participant hereunder , as determined by the Company . In addition, to the extent required by Section 409A, amounts deferred under
this Plan shall be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as provided by Section 409A, and any amounts that become taxable
hereunder pursuant to Section 409A shall be reported as taxable compensation to the Participant as provided by Section 409A.
7.06     Section 16 Compliance :
(a)    In General . This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly , in
the case of a deferral or other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it
were approved by the Company’ s Board of Directors or Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan
shall be administered by delegates of the Board of Directors, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in
a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the
maximum possible extent.
(b)    Approval of Distributions : This subsection (b) shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is being
distributed to a Participant in cash, (ii) is wholly or partly invested in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund at the time the
deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash to be distributed to a Participant, (iii) either was the subject of a Second
Look Election or was not covered by an agreement or Plan provisions, applicable at the time of the Participant’ s original deferral
election, that any investments in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would, once made, remain in that fund until
distribution of the deferral, (iv) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act at the time the interest in the
Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would be liquidated in connection with the distribution, and (v) if paid at the time the
distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in a violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an
opposite way transaction that would be matched with the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the PepsiCo Common Stock
Fund (either as a “discretionary transaction,” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) (a
“Covered Distribution”). In the case of a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the Phantom
PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the time the distribution
would be made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then the actual distribution to the
Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier of:
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the liquidation
of the Participant’ s interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution, or
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the Participant is
no longer subject to Section 16 of the Act, or when the time between the liquidation and an opposite way transaction is
sufficient.
34
7.07     Conformance with Section 409A :
Effective from and after January 1, 2009, at all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance
with the requirements of Section 409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt
from Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section
shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.
35
Article VIII – CLAIMS PROCEDURE
8.01     Claims for Benefits:
If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter , "Claimant") does not receive timely payment of any benefits which
he or she believes are due and payable under the Plan, he or she may make a claim for benefits to the Plan Administrator . The claim
for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan Administrator . If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator
will notify the Claimant within 90 days after the Plan Administrator initially received the benefit claim. However , if special
circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to
the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-
day period. Any notice of a denial of benefits shall advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or
information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to appeal his or her
claim for benefits.
8.02     Appeals of Denied Claims :
Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written appeal for a review of his or her claim by the
Plan Administrator . The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she received the notice denying
his or her claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be communicated to the Claimant within 60 days after receipt of a
request for appeal. The notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan Administrator's decision. If special circumstances require an
extension of time for processing the appeal, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the
termination of the initial 60-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 60-day period. In no event
shall the Plan Administrator ’s decision be rendered later than 120 days after receipt of a request for appeal.
8.03     Special Claims Procedures for Disability Determinations:
Notwithstanding Sections 8.01 and 8.02 to the contrary , if the claim or appeal of the Claimant relates to Disability benefits,
such claim or appeal shall be processed pursuant to the applicable provisions of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-
1 relating to Disability benefits, including Sections 2560.503-1(d), 2560.503-1(f)(3), 2560.503-1(h)(4) and 2560.503-1(i)(3).
36
Article IX – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
9.01     Amendment of Plan:
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has the right in its sole discretion to amend this
Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any manner , including the manner of making deferral elections, the terms on which
distributions are made, and the form and timing of distributions. However , except for mere clarifying amendments necessary to
avoid an inappropriate windfall, no Plan amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the Account of any Participant as of the
date such amendment is adopted. Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Committee. All Participants and
Beneficiaries shall be bound by such amendment. Any amendments made to the Plan shall be subject to any restrictions on
amendment that are applicable to ensure continued compliance under Section 409A.
9.02     Termination of Plan :
(a)    The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The Company , acting by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or through its entire Board of Directors, reserves the right to discontinue and
terminate the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of
the United States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be
binding upon all af fected Participants) and their Beneficiaries, but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at
that time to any Participant's Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), the termination resolution shall provide for
how amounts theretofore credited to af fected Participants' Accounts will be distributed.
(b)    This Section is subject to the same restrictions related to compliance with Section 409A that apply to Section
9.01. In accordance with these restrictions, the Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to terminate the Plan
and make distributions in connection with a change in ownership or ef fective control of the Company or a change in ownership of a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company , all within the meaning of Section 409A (a “Change in Control”), and the
maximum flexibility with respect to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in Control as is permissible under
Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a distribution may be made in connection with any
change in control with respect to deferrals made under this 409A Program.
37
Article X – MISCELLANEOUS
10.01     Limitation on Participant's Rights :
Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company . The Company
reserves the right to terminate the service of any Participant without any liability for any claim against the Company under this
Plan, except for a claim for payment of deferrals as provided herein.
10.02     Unfunded Obligation of the Company:
The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the
general assets of the Company . Nothing contained in this Plan requires the Company to set aside or hold in trust any amounts or
assets for the purpose of paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary , nor any other person shall have any
property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific Company asset. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation on the part of
the Company , and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts of
compensation deferred hereunder . Such a Participant shall not have any preference or priority over , the rights of any other
unsecured general creditor of the Company . No other Company af filiate guarantees or shares such obligation, and no other
Company af filiate shall have any liability to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary .
10.03     Other Plans:
This Plan shall not af fect the right of any Eligible Director or Participant to participate in and receive benefits under and in
accordance with the provisions of any other Director compensation plans which are now or hereafter maintained by the Company ,
unless the terms of such other plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it would cause such other plan to violate a
requirement for tax favored treatment.
10.04     Receipt or Release:
Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction
of all claims against the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper and the Company , and the Plan Administrator may require such

APPENDIX
APPENDIX AR TICLE A – TRANSITION PROVISIONS
This Article A provides the transition rules for the Plan that were ef fective at some time during the period beginning
January 1, 2005 and ending December 31, 2008. The time period during which each provision in this Article A was ef fective shall
be provided herein.
I. Cancellation Elections:
Pursuant to Q&A-20(a) of IRS Notice 2005-1, each Eligible Director shall have the right to cancel his or her election to
defer Director Compensation for the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear. Such election to cancel must be filed with the Plan
Administrator prior to the end of the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear and must follow any other procedures and timing requirements
established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (such procedures and timing requirements to be consistent with the
requirements of Q&A-20(a)). Any Eligible Director who makes an election to cancel such deferral election shall have the Director
Compensation related to such deferral election paid to him or her (plus any applicable earnings or minus any applicable losses)
from his or her Account by December 31, 2005 and such amount shall be reported as taxable income to the Eligible Director for the
2005 calendar year .
II. Modifications to Article IV :
Section 4.03(b) shall read as follows ef fective for deferral elections made for Compensation Y ears beginning before October
1, 2009:
(b)    Form of Payment . The default form of payment for initial deferral elections is a single lump sum that shall be
paid at the time applicable under Article IV . A Participant may only change the default payment from a lump sum to
installments by means of a Second Look Election that meets all of the requirements of Section 4.04. Form of payment
elections for Mandatory Deferrals are governed by Section 4.05.
III. Modifications to Article VI:
The rules set forth in this Article A, Section III apply to any distributions that have occurred or would occur based on
events, including any Separations from Service, or Specific Payment Dates that occurred prior to January 1, 2009.
For purposes of this Article A, Section III, the term “Retirement” shall mean Separation from Service after attaining
eligibility for retirement. A Participant attains eligibility for retirement when he or she attains age 50 while serving as a director on
the Board of Directors of the Company .
For purposes of this Article A, Section III, a new Section 6.05 is added as specified below , and existing Sections 6.05 and
6.06 (as set forth in the main portion of the Plan document) are renumbered as Sections 6.06 and 6.07 respectively .
A For this purpose, Sections 6.01(a)-(f)  read as follows:
A-1
(a) Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a
Specific Payment Date and the Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s (i) Separation from Service
(other than for Retirement), (ii) Disability , or (iii) death. However , if such a Participant Separates from Service
(other than for Retirement or death) prior to the Specific Payment Date (or prior to processing of the first installment
payment due in connection with the Specific Payment Date), Section 6.03 shall apply . If such a Participant dies prior
to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.04 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or
part of a Participant’ s Account. If such a Participant becomes Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section
6.06 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(b) Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies (i) when a Participant has elected to
defer until a Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than for Retirement or
death), or (ii) when applicable under Subsection (a) above).
(c) Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when the Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled to
receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 (see below) at the time of his or her death,
Section 6.04 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.04 would result in an earlier
distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(d) Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Retirement) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a
Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service on account of his or her Retirement.
Subsections (c) and (e) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or Section 6.06 take precedence over Section
6.05.
(e) Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when the Participant becomes Disabled. If a
Participant who becomes Disabled dies, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.06 to the extent it would
result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is
receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 at the time of his Disability , Section 6.06 shall take
precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.06 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a
Participant’ s Account.
(f) Section 6.07 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when the Participant incurs an
Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to when a Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.06. In
this case, the provisions of Section 6.07 shall take precedence over Sections 6.02 through 6.06 to the extent Section
6.07 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of the Participant’ s Account.
B For this purpose, Section 6.02  reads as follows:
A-2
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a
Participant’ s Specific Payment Date for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability , or (ii) the
Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than Retirement) or (iii) the Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall
be distributed based on the occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
(a) If the Participant has not made a valid Second Look Election that includes installment payments, the Deferral
Subaccount shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that corresponds to the Participant’ s Specific
Payment Date, and the resulting amount shall be paid in a single lump sum.
(b) If the Participant has made a valid Second Look Election that includes installment payments, the first installment
payment shall be paid (based on the schedule elected in the Participant’ s Second Look Election) on the Specific
Payment Date. Thereafter , installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the
Participant, except as provided in Sections 6.03, 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 (relating to distributions on account of a
Separation from Service, death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be
determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Subsection, if before the date the
first installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant Separates from Service other than for
Retirement) or the Participant would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.03, 6.04 or 6.06
(relating to a distribution on account of Separation from Service, death or Disability), the Participant’ s Deferral
Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based on such Specific Payment Date shall instead be distributed in
accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or Disability), whichever applies,
but only to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section
6.04 or 6.06.
C For this purpose, Section 6.03  reads as follows:
A Participant’ s total Account shall be distributed upon the occurrence of a Participant's Separation from Service (other than
for Retirement, Disability or death) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section. When used in this Section,
the phrase “Separation from Service” shall only refer to a Separation from Service that is not for Retirement, Disability or
death.
(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), a Participant’ s total Account balance, shall be distributed in a single lump sum
payment on the first day of the first Plan Y ear after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(b) If the Participant incurs a Separation from Service after making a valid Second Look Election (and before the first
payment has been processed in accordance with such Second Look Election), each Deferral Subaccount to which the
Second Look Election applies shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on the
A-3
latest of the following: (1) the first day of the calendar quarter beginning on or after the fifth anniversary of the
payment date selected in the Participant’ s original deferral election under Section 4.03, (2) the first day of the Plan
Year following the Separation from Service, or (3) the date applicable under Subsection (c). However , if the Plan
Administrator determines that Section 409A would permit a lump sum payment to be made earlier than the date
specified in clause (1) of the preceding sentence, then the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting the
earliest date permissible under Section 409A for the date in clause (1). If the Participant’ s Separation from Service
occurs on or after the date the first payment is processed, payment will be made in accordance with the Second Look
Election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 relating to distributions on account of death,
Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
(c) If the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at such
other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account
shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Separation from Service, earlier than the date that is at least 6
months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
D For this purpose, a new Section 6.05  reads as follows:
6.05    Distributions on Account of Retirement :
If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service on account of his or her Retirement, the Participant’ s Account shall be
distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section.
(a) If the Participant’ s Retirement is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a Deferral Subaccount, the
Participant’ s deferral election pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall continue to be
given ef fect, and the Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed based upon the provisions of Section 6.02.
(b) If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service, distribution of
the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first day of the first Plan Y ear after the date of the
Participant’ s Separation from Service. Such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment under Section
4.03. However , if the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Retirement (or at
such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s
Account shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Retirement, earlier than the date that is at least 6 months
after the Participant’ s Retirement.
(c) If the Participant is receiving installment payments for one or more Deferral Subaccounts in accordance with
Section 6.02 at the time of his or her Retirement, such installment payments shall continue to be paid based upon the
Participant’ s Second Look Election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.06 and
A-4
6.07 relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
IV.    Modification to Article VII .
For periods ef fective from and after January 1, 2005 and on or before December 31, 2008, the language of Section 7.07
shall be replaced in its entirety with the following language:
7.07    Conformance with Section 409A :
At all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance with the requirements of Section
409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to
preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. Any action that may be taken (and, to the extent possible, any
action actually taken) by the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper or the Company shall not be taken (or shall be void and
without ef fect), if such action violates the requirements of Section 409A or if such action would adversely af fect the
grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. If the failure to take an action under the Plan would violate Section 409A, then to the
extent it is possible thereby to avoid a violation of Section 409A, the rights and ef fects under the Plan shall be altered to
avoid such violation. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a failure to take an action that would adversely af fect
the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. Any provision in this Plan document that is determined to violate the
requirements of Section 409A or to adversely af fect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program shall be void and without
effect. In addition, any provision that is required to appear in this Plan document to satisfy the requirements of Section
409A, but that is not expressly set forth, shall be deemed to be set forth herein, and the Plan shall be administered in all
respects as if such provision were expressly set forth. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a provision that is
required to preserve the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section shall apply
notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.

Article I – INTRODUCTION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”) established the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program (the “Plan”) in 1972 to permit
eligible executives to defer certain cash awards made under its executive compensation programs. Deferrals under the Plan that
were earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 are governed by a separate set of documents that set forth the pre-Section
409A terms of the Plan (the “Pre-409A Program”). The terms of the Plan that are applicable to deferrals that are subject to Section
409A, i.e., generally , deferred amounts that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (the “409A Program”) are governed by
this document. This document sets forth the 409A Program and is ef fective as of January 1, 2005 (the “Ef fective Date”). Except as
otherwise provided herein, this document reflects the provisions in ef fect from and after January 1, 2005, and the rights and
benefits of individuals who are Participants in the Plan from and after that date (and of those claiming through or on behalf of such
individuals) shall be governed by the provisions of this document in the case of actions and events occurring on or after the
Effective Date with respect to deferrals that are subject to the 409A Program. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
“actions and events” shall include all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and benefits with respect to persons who only
participated in the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Pre-409A Program
documents that were in ef fect at such time, and shall not be governed by the 409A Program documents.
Together , the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single
plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall
be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the
separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to permit the Pre-409A Program
to remain exempt from Section 409A, and the administration of the Plan shall be consistent with this intent.
In addition, this document incorporates all of the amendments to the 409A Program through December 31, 2018. As a result
of these amendments, certain provisions include specific ef fective dates that are after the general Ef fective Date of this restatement.
Earlier versions of this restatement should be consulted for the provisions that were in ef fect between the general Ef fective Date
and these specific ef fective dates.
This document for the 409A Program was most recently restated ef fective as of January 1, 2019. This restatement changed,
among other things, the 409A Program’ s eligibility criteria, timing of Bonus Compensation deferral elections and rules for Second
Look Elections (to permit an unlimited number of Second Look Elections ef fective for Second Look Elections made on or after
January 1, 2020).
For federal income tax purposes, the Plan is intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is unfunded and
unsecured. For purposes of ERISA, the Plan is intended to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of
ERISA providing unfunded benefits to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

Article II– DEFINITIONS
When used in this Plan, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless a dif ferent meaning
is plainly required by the context:
2.01     Account:
The account maintained for a Participant on the books of his or her Employer to determine, from time to time, the
Participant’ s interest under this Plan. The balance in such Account shall be determined by the Recordkeeper pursuant to any
guidelines established by the Plan Administrator . Each Participant’ s Account shall consist of at least one Deferral Subaccount for
each separate deferral under Section 5.01. The Recordkeeper may also establish such additional Deferral Subaccounts as it deems
necessary for the proper administration of the Plan. The Recordkeeper may also combine Deferral Subaccounts to the extent it
deems separate accounts are not needed for sound recordkeeping. Where appropriate, a reference to a Participant’ s Account shall
include a reference to each applicable Deferral Subaccount that has been established thereunder .
2.02     Act:
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time.
2.03     Base Compensation:
Effective on or after January 1, 201 1, an Eligible Executive’ s adjusted base salary , to the extent payable in U.S. dollars from
an Employer ’s U.S. payroll (or as otherwise payable, with respect to currency and payroll, and provided in Section 3.01(a) in

(for periods before January 1, 2017, references in this paragraph to “LG2” shall be applied as references to “Band II”) . If a
promoted Eligible Executive does not satisfy the requirements of the previous sentence, he or she shall not be eligible to
defer Bonus Compensation earned for the Performance Period relating to the Plan Y ear in which he or she is promoted .
(3)    Performance Criteria for Performance Periods Ending Before 2020 . For Performance Periods ending
before January 1, 2020, notwithstanding Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) above, an Eligible Executive shall not be eligible to
defer Bonus Compensation for a Plan Y ear unless (i) the Bonus Compensation is contingent on the satisfaction of
organizational or individual performance criteria for the Performance Period that relates to the Plan Y ear, (ii) such criteria
have been established in writing by
14
not later than 90 days after the beginning of the applicable Performance Period, and (iii) the Bonus Compensation otherwise
satisfies the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 409A.
(c)    Election Form Rules . To be ef fective in deferring Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation, an Eligible
Executive’ s Election Form must set forth the percentage of Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation (whichever applies) to be
deferred, the deferral period under Section 4.03, the form of payment under Section 4.04, and any other information that may be
required by the Plan Administrator from time to time. In addition, the Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 4.02. It
is contemplated that an Eligible Executive will specify the investment choice under Section 5.02 (in multiples of 1%) for the
Eligible Executive’ s deferral. However , this is not a condition for making an ef fective election.
4.02     Time and Manner of Deferral Election:
(a)    Deferrals of Base Compensation .
(1)    In General . An Eligible Executive must make a deferral election for a Plan Y ear with respect to Base
Compensation no later than December 31 of the year prior to the Plan Y ear in which the Base Compensation would
otherwise be paid. If December 31(or an applicable earlier day) is not a business day , the deadline shall be the nearest
preceding day that is a business day . Notwithstanding the prior two sentences, the Plan Administrator may adopt policies
and procedures that encourage or require earlier submission of Election Forms, but in which case any requirement for the
earlier submission of an Election Form may be waived (but not beyond the date specified by the first sentence of this
subsection) by the Plan Administrator to prevent undue hardship for one or more Eligible Executives. Any changes in such
policies or procedures or in established waiver practices from those applicable on January 1, 2019 shall be subject to
Section 7.06.
(2)    Mid-Y ear Elections for Plan Y ears Before 2020 . For Plan Y ears ending before January 1, 2020, subject
to the last sentence of Section 3.01(a)(2) and (for later Plan Y ears) Section 3.05, an individual who newly becomes an
Eligible Executive will have 30 days from the date the individual becomes an Eligible Executive to make a deferral election
with respect to Base Compensation that is earned for services performed after the election is received (the “30-Day Election
Period”). The 30-Day Election Period may be used to make an election for Base Compensation that otherwise would be
paid in the Plan Y ear in which the individual becomes an Eligible Executive. In addition, the 30-Day Election Period may
be used to make an election for Base Compensation that would otherwise be paid in the next Plan Y ear (i.e., the Plan Y ear
following when the individual becomes an Eligible Executive), if the individual becomes an Eligible Executive not later
than December 31 of a Plan Y ear. Thus, if a Base Compensation deferral election for a Plan Y ear is made in reliance on the
30-day rule, then the Plan Administrator shall apply the restriction that the election may only apply to Base Compensation
earned for services performed after the date the election is received by the Recordkeeper .
15
(b)    Deferrals of Bonus Compensation .
(1)     Performance Periods Ending After 2019 . In the case of an Eligible Executive’ s Bonus Compensation
that relates to a Performance Period ending after December 31, 2019, an Eligible Executive must make a deferral election
with respect to such Bonus Compensation no later than the last day of the Company’ s fiscal year that ends just before such
Performance Period. If the last day of such fiscal year is not a business day , the deadline shall be the nearest preceding day
that is a business day .
(2)     Performance Periods Ending Before 2019 . In the case of an Eligible Executive’ s Bonus Compensation
that relates to a Performance Period ending before December 31, 2019, the Eligible Executive must make a deferral election
with respect to his or her Bonus Compensation at least six months prior to the end of the Performance Period for which the
applicable Bonus Compensation is paid, and this election will be the Eligible Executive’ s bonus deferral election for the
Plan Y ear to which the Performance Period relates. This applies to both continuing Eligible Executives and individuals who
newly become Eligible Executives. Accordingly , if an individual becomes an Eligible Executive during a Plan Y ear as a
result of a promotion and is eligible to defer Bonus Compensation under Section 4.01(b) for such Plan Y ear, such Eligible
Executive must make a deferral election for Bonus Compensation that is earned for the Performance Period that relates to
the Plan Y ear in which he or she is promoted at least six months prior to the end of the applicable Performance Period.
Notwithstanding the provisions in Paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Plan Administrator may adopt policies and procedures
that encourage or require earlier submission of Election Forms, but in which case any requirement for the earlier submission of an
Election Form may be waived (but not beyond the date otherwise applicable under Paragraph (1) and (2) above) by the Plan
Administrator to prevent undue hardship for one or more Eligible Executives. Any changes in such policies or procedures or in
established waiver practices from those applicable on January 1, 2019 shall be subject to Section 7.06.
(c)    General Provisions . For purposes of Section 3.01 and this Section 4.02, the period of time to make the deferral
election described under (a) and (b) above shall be referred to as the Deferral W indow . A separate deferral election under (a) or
(b) above must be made by an Eligible Executive for each category of a Plan Y ear’s compensation that is eligible for deferral. If a
properly completed and executed Election Form is not actually received by the Recordkeeper (or , if authorized, the Plan
Administrator) by the deadline applicable under Subsections (a) and (b) above, the Eligible Executive will be deemed to have
elected not to defer any Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation, as the case may be, for the applicable Plan Y ear or the
Performance Period that relates to the Plan Y ear, as applicable. Except as provided below in this subsection, an election is
irrevocable once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed (and such determination shall be
made not later than the last date for making the election in question). Increases or decreases in the amount or percentage a
Participant elects to defer shall not be permitted during a Plan Y ear. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ef fective as of January 1, 2008,
if a Participant receives a hardship distribution under a cash or deferred profit sharing plan that is sponsored by a member of the
PepsiCo Or ganization
16
and such plan requires that deferrals under such plan be suspended for a period of time following the hardship distribution, the Plan
Administrator may cancel the Participant’ s deferral election under this Plan so that no deferrals shall be made during such
suspension period. If an election is cancelled because of a hardship distribution in accordance with the prior sentence, such
cancellation shall permanently apply to the deferral election or elections for any Plan Y ear covered by such suspension period and
the Participant will only be eligible to make a new deferral election for the Plan Y ear that begins after the end of the suspension
period, and such new election shall be made in accordance with the rules of Sections 4.01 and 4.02.
(d)    Beneficiaries .
(1) A Participant may designate on the Election Form (or in some other manner authorized by the Plan
Administrator) one or more Beneficiaries to receive payment, in the event of his or her death, of the amounts credited to his
or her Account; provided that, to be ef fective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and
must meet such other standards (including any requirement for spousal consent) as the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper
shall require from time to time. The Beneficiary designation must also be filed with the Recordkeeper (or the Plan
Administrator for periods prior to June 3, 2002) prior to the Participant’ s death. An incomplete Beneficiary designation, as
determined by the Recordkeeper or Plan Administrator , shall be void and of no ef fect. In determining whether a Beneficiary
designation that relates to the Plan is in ef fect, unrevoked designations that were received under the Pre-409A Program or
prior to the Ef fective Date shall be considered. A Beneficiary designation of an individual by name remains in ef fect
regardless of any change in the designated individual’ s relationship to the Participant. Solely for periods prior to June 3,
2002, a Beneficiary designation solely by relationship (for example, a designation of “spouse,” that does not give the name
of the spouse) shall designate whoever is the person in that relationship to the Participant at his or her death. However , any
Beneficiary designation submitted to the Recordkeeper from and after June 3, 2002 that only specifies a Beneficiary by
relationship shall not be considered an ef fective Beneficiary designation and shall be void and of no ef fect. If more than one
Beneficiary is specified and the Participant fails to indicate the respective percentage applicable to two or more
Beneficiaries, then each Beneficiary for whom a percentage is not designated will be entitled to an equal share of the
portion of the Account (if any) for which percentages have not been designated. At any time, a Participant may change a
Beneficiary designation for his or her Account in a writing that is signed by the Participant and filed with the Recordkeeper
prior to the Participant’ s death, and that meets such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to
time. An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary with respect to a Participant’ s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when
all payments have been made from the Account.
(2)    If the Participant designates a Beneficiary and such Beneficiary survives the Participant, but dies prior
to the complete distribution of such Beneficiary’ s interest in the Participant’ s Account, the Plan Administrator shall direct
the Recordkeeper to pay such Beneficiary’ s remaining interest in the Participant’ s Account to the Beneficiary’ s estate.
17
4.03     Period of Deferral:
An Eligible Executive making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his or her Election Form by designating
either a Specific Payment Date or the date he or she incurs a Separation from Service. In no event shall an Eligible Executive’ s
deferral period end later than his or her 80th birthday , regardless of whether the Participant chose a single lump sum or installments
as the form of payment. Notwithstanding an Eligible Executive’ s actual election of a Specific Payment Date, an Eligible Executive
shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than:
 
(a)     For Base Compensation that is paid from and after January 1, 2008, at least twelve (12) months after the end of
the Plan Y ear during which the Base Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral; and
 
(b)     For Bonus Compensation that is paid from and after January 1, 2008, at least eighteen (18) months after the date
the Bonus Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral.
 
In the case of a deferral to a Specific Payment Date, if an Eligible Executive’ s Election Form either fails to specify a period
of deferral or specifies a period less than the applicable minimum, the Eligible Executive shall be deemed to have selected a
Specific Payment Date equal to the minimum period of deferral as provided in Subsections (a) and (b) above.
4.04     Form of Deferral Payout:
An Eligible Executive making a deferral election shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by
designating either a lump sum payment or installment payments to be paid over a period of no more than 20 years, and not later
than the Executive’ s 80th birthday . Any election for installment payments shall also specify (a) the frequency for which installment
payments shall be paid, which shall be quarterly , semi-annually and annually and (b) whether the installment payments shall be
paid in a fixed dollar amount or for a fixed number of years. Installment elections for a fixed dollar amount shall be paid based on
the selected frequency and the selected amount until the applicable Deferral Subaccount is exhausted, but shall not be paid for a
period of more than 20 years and not later than the Executive’ s 80th birthday . If an Eligible Executive elects installments for a
period extending beyond the Eligible Executive’ s 80th birthday (or for purposes of a fixed dollar amount installment election, the
installments would continue beyond the Executive’ s 80th birthday or beyond 20 years), such election shall be treated as an election
for installments over a period of whole and partial years that ends on the Eligible Executive’ s 80th birthday or , if earlier , at the end
of 20 years; provided that the amounts to be distributed in connection with the installments prior to the Eligible Executive’ s 80th
birthday or prior to the end of 20 years shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.08 and his or her election by assuming that
the installments shall continue for the full number of installments or the elected fixed dollar amount, with the entire remaining
amount of the relevant Deferral Subaccount distributed on the Eligible Executive’ s 80th birthday or at the end of 20 years.
18
4.05     Second Look Elections:
(a)    In General . Subject to Subsection (b) below and the next sentence, a Participant who has made a valid initial deferral
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Article may subsequently make additional elections regarding the time and/or
form of payment of his or her deferral. This opportunity to modify the Participant’ s initial election is referred to as a “Second Look
Election.” For periods before January 1, 2020, a Participant was eligible to make only one Second Look Election with respect to
each individual deferral of Base or Bonus Compensation.
    
(b)    Requirements for Second Look Elections . A Second Look Election is subject to all of the conditions of Subsection (a)
above and must comply with all of the following requirements:
(1)    If a Participant’ s initial election for a deferral (or the latest subsequent Second Look Election) specified
payment based on a Specific Payment Date, the Participant may only change the payment terms for such deferral through a
current Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s original (or if applicable,
last subsequently elected) Specific Payment Date. In addition, in this case the Participant’ s current Second Look Election
must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral to a new Specific Payment Date that is at least five years after the
original (or if applicable, last subsequently elected) Specific Payment Date.
(2)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment based on the Participant’ s Separation from Service,
the Participant may only make a Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s
Separation from Service and the Participant separates from Service for Retirement. In addition, in this case the Participant’ s
Second Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral for at least five years. For example, the Second
Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral to a Specific Payment Date that turns out to be at least
five years after the later of (i) the Participant’ s Separation from Service or (ii) the last designated period following the
Participant’ s Separation from Service that was designated in a prior Second Look Election. Alternatively , the Second Look
Election may delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral for a designated period of five years (or more) following the
later of (A) the Participant’ s Separation from Service or (B) the end of the last period following the Participant’ s Separation
from Service that was designated in a prior Second Look Election. If the five-year delay election is made by selecting a
Specific Payment Date that turns out to be less than five years after the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or if later , the
last designated period following the Participant’ s Separation from Service), the Second Look Election is void and payment
shall be made based on the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or if later , the last validly designated period following the
Participant’ s Separation from Service).
(3)    For periods before January 1, 2013, neither a Separation from Service nor a period of delay after a
Separation from Service could be specified as the payout date resulting from a Second Look Election.
19
(4)    To the extent permitted by Subsection (a) above, a Participant may make an unlimited number of
Second Look Elections for each individual deferral, however , each Second Look Election must comply with all of the
requirements of this Section 4.05.
(5)    A Participant who changes the form of his or her payment election from lump sum to installments will be
subject to the provisions of the Plan regarding installment payment elections in Section 4.04, and such installment payments
must begin no earlier than five years after when the lump sum payment would have been paid based upon the Participant’ s
initial election (or , if applicable, any subsequent Second Look Election). A Participant may not make a Second Look
Election if the election would provide for installment payments to be made after the Participant’ s 80th birthday .
(6)    If a Participant’ s initial election (or any subsequent Second Look Election) specified payment in the form of
installments and the Participant wants to elect installment payments over a greater or lesser number of years or wants to
elect a dif ferent frequency of installment payments ( e.g., change from annual installments to quarterly installments), the
election will be subject to the provisions of the Plan regarding installment payment elections in Section 4.04, and the first
payment date of the new installment payment schedule must be no earlier than five years after the first payment date that
applied under the Participant’ s initial (or , if applicable, subsequent) installment election. A Participant may not make a
Second Look Election if the election would provide for installment payments to be made after the Participant’ s 80th
birthday .
(7)    If a Participant’ s initial election (or subsequent Second Look Election) specified payment in the form of
installments and the Participant wants to elect instead payment in a lump sum, the earliest payment date of the lump sum
must be no earlier than five years after the first payment date that applied under the Participant’ s initial (or , if applicable,
subsequent) installment election.
(8)    For purposes of this Section and Code Section 409A, all of a Participant’ s installment payments related to a
specific deferral election shall be treated as a single payment.
A Second Look Election will be void and payment will be made based on the Participant’ s original election under Sections
4.03 and 4.04 if all of the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs of this subsection are not satisfied in full. However , if a
Participant’ s Second Look Election becomes ef fective in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the Participant’ s
original (or , if applicable, subsequent) election shall be superseded (including any Specific Payment Date specified therein), and
this original (or , if applicable, subsequent) election shall not be taken into account with respect to the deferral that is subject to the
effective Second Look Election.
(c)    Plan Administrator ’s Role . Each Participant has the sole responsibility to elect a Second Look Election by
contacting the Recordkeeper (or , if authorized, the Plan
20
Administrator) and to comply with the requirements of this Section. The Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may provide a
notice of a Second Look Election opportunity to some or all Participants, but the Recordkeeper and Plan Administrator are under
no obligation to provide such notice (or to provide it to all Participants, in the event a notice is provided only to some Participants).
The Recordkeeper and the Plan Administrator have no discretion to waive or otherwise modify any requirement for a Second Look
Election set forth in this Section or in Section 409A.
21
Article V – INTERESTS OF P ARTICIP ANTS
5.01     Accounting for Participants’ Interests:
(a)    Deferral Subaccounts . Each Participant shall have at least one separate Deferral Subaccount for each separate
deferral of Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation made by the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’ s deferral shall be
credited as of the date of the deferral to his or her Account as soon as administratively practicable following the date the
compensation would be paid in the absence of a deferral. A Participant’ s Account is a bookkeeping device to track the value of the
Participant’ s deferrals (and his or her Employer ’s liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with
any Account, and no Account shall be insured or otherwise secured.
(b)    Account Earnings or Losses . As of each V aluation Date, a Participant’ s Account shall be credited with earnings
and gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to his or her Account had actually
been invested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this Article (as modified by Section 5.05, if applicable). The Plan
provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual.
However , they shall be applied to measure the value of a Participant’ s Account and the amount of his or her Employer ’s liability to
make deferred payments to or on behalf of the Participant.
5.02     Investment Options:
(a)    General . Each of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts shall be invested on a phantom basis in any combination
of phantom investment options specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’ s death, by his or her Beneficiary) from
those of fered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose from time to time. The Plan Administrator may discontinue any phantom
investment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’ s phantom
investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another replacement
option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan Administrator may apply).
(b)    Phantom Investment Options . The basic phantom investment options of fered under the Plan are as follows:
(1)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund . Participant Accounts invested in this phantom option
are adjusted to reflect an investment in the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund, which is of fered under the PepsiCo Savings Plan
(or such similar plan as may be of fered by the Company from time to time). An amount deferred or transferred into this
option is converted to phantom units in the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund by dividing such amount by the NA V of the fund
on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator . A Participant’ s
interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund is valued as of a V aluation Date (or a Distribution V aluation Date) by
multiplying the number of phantom units credited to the Participant’ s Account on such date by the NA V of a unit in the
PepsiCo Common
22
Stock Fund on such date. If shares of PepsiCo Common Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, mer ger, consolidation, spin-of f, combination or exchange of shares or other any other corporate change
treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator , such equitable adjustment shall be made in the number and
kind of phantom units credited to an Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be necessary or
appropriate. In no event will shares of PepsiCo Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no
Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of PepsiCo Common Stock on account of an interest in this phantom
option.
    
(2)    Phantom AFR Fund : This fund is established ef fective from and after December 29, 2006. Participant
Accounts invested in this phantom option accrue a return based upon an interest rate that is 120% of the applicable Federal
long-term rate (pursuant to Code Section 1274(d) or any successor provision) applicable for annual compounding, as
published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from time to time. Returns accrue for each month based upon 120% of the
applicable Federal long-term rate (applicable for annual compounding) in ef fect on the first business day of each month and
are compounded annually . An amount deferred or transferred into this option is credited with the applicable rate of return
beginning with the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator .
(3)    Other Funds . From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate which (if any) other investment
options shall be available as phantom investment options under this Plan. These phantom investment options shall be
described in materials provided to Participants from time to time. Any of these phantom investment options shall be
administered under procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator . Unless otherwise specified in
these materials or procedures, in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an
amount deferred or transferred into such option is converted to phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by
dividing such amount by the NA V of a unit in such fund on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested
in this option by the Plan Administrator . Thereafter , a Participant’ s interest in each such phantom option is valued as of a
Valuation Date (or a Distribution V aluation Date) by multiplying the number of phantom units credited to his or her
Account on such date by the NA V of a unit in such fund on such date.
5.03     Method of Allocation:
(a)     Deferral Elections . With respect to any deferral election by a Participant, the Participant may use his or her Election
Form to allocate the deferral in one percent increments among the phantom investment options then of fered by the Plan
Administrator . If an Election Form related to an original deferral election specifies phantom investment options for less than 100%
of the Participant’ s deferral, the Recordkeeper shall allocate the Participant’ s deferrals to the Phantom AFR Fund to the extent
necessary to provide for investment of 100% of the Participant’ s deferral. If an Election Form related to an original deferral election
specifies phantom investment options for more than 100% of the Participant’ s deferral, the Recordkeeper
23
shall prorate all of the Participant’ s investment allocations to the extent necessary to reduce (after rounding to whole percents) the
Participant’ s aggregate investment percentages to 100%.
(b)     Fund T ransfers . A Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in a Deferral Subaccount by properly
completing and submitting a fund transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper and specifying, in increments
permitted by the Plan Administrator , the reallocation of his or her Deferral Subaccount among the phantom investment options then
offered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose. (The rules relating to non-paper formats for Election Forms shall also apply to
the fund transfer form.) Effective as of January 1, 2020, the increments permitted by the Plan Administrator are whole percentages,
whole shares or whole dollars, as specified in the fund transfer forms provided to Participants and authorized by the Plan
Administrator . If a fund transfer form provides for investing less than or more than 100% of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount,
it will be void and disregarded. Any transfer form that is not void under the preceding sentence shall be ef fective as of the V aluation
Date next occurring after its receipt by the Recordkeeper , but the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper may also specify a minimum
number of days in advance of which such transfer form must be received in order for the form to become ef fective as of such next
Valuation Date. If more than one fund transfer form is received on a timely basis, the form that the Plan Administrator or
Recordkeeper determines to be the most recent shall be followed.
(c)     Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund Restrictions . Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, the
Plan Administrator may at any time alter the ef fective date of any investment or allocation involving the Phantom PepsiCo
Common Stock Fund pursuant to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards against insider trading). The Plan Administrator may also,
to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-3(f) of the Act, arrange for tracking of any such transaction defined in
Rule 16b-3(b)(1) of the Act and bar any such transaction to the extent it would not be exempt under Rule 16b-3(f). The Company
may also impose blackout periods pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 whenever the Company
determines that circumstances warrant. Further , the Company may impose quarterly blackout periods on insider trading in the
Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund as needed (as determined by the Company), timed to coincide with the release of the
Company’ s quarterly earnings reports. The commencement and termination of these blackout periods in each quarter , the parties to
which they apply and the activities they restrict shall be as set forth in the of ficial insider trading policy promulgated by the
Company from time to time. These provisions shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary except Section
7.07 (relating to compliance with Section 409A).
        
5.04     Vesting of a Participant’s Account:
A Participant’ s interest in the value of his or her Account shall at all times be 100 percent vested, which means that it will
not forfeit as a result of his or her Separation from Service.
5.05     Forfeiture of Earnings for Prohibited Misconduct:
Effective beginning with deferrals for Bonus Compensation for the 2006 Plan Y ear and deferrals for Base Compensation for
the 2007 Plan Y ear, and notwithstanding any other provision
24
of this Plan to the contrary , if the Plan Administrator determines that a Participant has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any
time prior to the second anniversary of his or her Separation from Service, the Participant shall forfeit all current and future net
earnings and gains that have been or will be credited to his or her Account under the provisions of Sections 5.01(b) and/or 6.08, and
his or her Account balance shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture. Accordingly , a Participant who has engaged in Prohibited
Misconduct during such period shall only be eligible to receive a distribution of the lesser of: (a) the aggregate amount of his or her
Base Compensation and Bonus Compensation deferrals under this Plan that relate to elections made for and after the 2006 Plan
Year for Bonus Compensation and the 2007 Plan Y ear for Base Compensation (the “Af fected Deferrals”), or (b) the net value of the
Participant’ s Affected Deferrals as of the date the Plan Administrator determines that the Participant has engaged in Prohibited
Misconduct.
25
Article VI – DISTRIBUTIONS
6.01     General:
A Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount(s) that are governed by the terms of this 409A Program shall be distributed as provided
in this Article, subject in all cases to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards against insider trading) and Section 7.06 (relating to
compliance with Section 16 of the Act). All Deferral Subaccount balances (including those hypothetically invested in the Phantom
PepsiCo Common Stock Fund) shall be distributed in cash. In no event shall any portion of a Participant’ s Account be distributed
earlier or later than is allowed under Section 409A.
The following general rules shall apply for purposes of interpreting the provisions of this Article VI.
(a)    Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a
Specific Payment Date and the Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s (i) Separation from Service (other than for
Retirement), (ii) Disability , or (iii) death. However , if such a Participant Separates from Service (other than for Retirement or death)
prior to the Specific Payment Date (or prior to processing of the first installment or Second Look Election payment due in
connection with the Specific Payment Date), Section 6.03 shall apply . If such a Participant dies prior to the Specific Payment Date,
Section 6.04 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If such a
Participant becomes Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.06 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier
distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(b)    Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies (i) when a Participant has elected to
defer until a Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than for Retirement or death), or (ii)
when applicable under Subsection (a) above.
(c)    Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when a Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled to receive
or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 at the time of his death, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over those
sections to the extent Section 6.04 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(d)    Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Retirement) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a
Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service on account of his or her Retirement. Subsections (c) and
(e) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or 6.06 take precedence over Section 6.05.
(e)    Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when a Participant becomes Disabled. If a Participant
who becomes Disabled dies, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.06 to the extent it would result in an earlier
distribution of all or
26
part of a Participant’ s Account. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 at
the time of his Disability , Section 6.06 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.06 would result in an earlier
distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(f)    Section 6.07 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when a Participant incurs an
Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to when a Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.06. In this case, the
provisions of Section 6.07 shall take precedence over Sections 6.02 through 6.06 to the extent Section 6.07 would result in an
earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
6.02     Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date:
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a
Participant’ s Specific Payment Date for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability , (ii) the Participant’ s
Separation from Service (other than for Retirement), or (iii) the Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall be distributed
based on the occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
(a)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum pursuant to Section 4.04 or 4.05,
whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or
immediately precedes the Participant’ s Specific Payment Date, and the resulting amount shall be paid in a single lump sum on the
Specific Payment Date.
(b)    This subsection shall be ef fective for Specific Payment Dates and Separations from Service occurring from and
after January 1, 2009. If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of installments pursuant to Section 4.04 or
4.05, whichever is applicable, the Participant’ s first installment payment shall be paid on the Specific Payment Date. Thereafter ,
installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the Participant (subject to the provisions of this
Plan that constrain such elections), except as provided in Sections 6.03, 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 (relating to distributions upon
Separation from Service (other than Retirement), death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment
shall be determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, if before the date the last
installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant Separates from Service (other than Retirement) or the Participant
would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.06 (relating to distributions on account of death or
Disability), the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based on such
Specific Payment Date shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section 6.03, 6.04 or 6.06 (relating to distributions on
account of Separation from Service (other than Retirement), death or Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would
result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section 6.04 or Section 6.06.
27
6.03     Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service:
A Participant’ s total Account shall be distributed upon the occurrence of a Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than
for Retirement, Disability or death) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section. When used in this Section, the
phrase “Separation from Service” shall only refer to a Separation from Service that is not for Retirement, Disability or death. The
rules of this Section shall be ef fective for Specific Payment Dates and Separations from Service occurring from and after January 1,
2009.
(a)    Subject to Subsection (c), for those Deferral Subaccounts that have a Specific Payment Date that is after the
Participant’ s Separation from Service, such Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first day
of the calendar quarter that follows the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(b)    Subject to Subsection (c), if the Participant’ s Separation from Service is on or after the Specific Payment Date
(including a Specific Payment Date resulting from a Second Look Election) applicable to a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount and
the Participant has selected installment payments as the form of distribution for the Deferral Subaccount, then such Deferral
Subaccount shall be distributed as follows:
(1)     If the first installment payment has been processed prior to the Participant’ s Separation from Service,
then the Participant’ s remaining installment payment election shall be void and the Participant shall be paid a single lump
sum distribution for the remaining balance of the Deferral Subaccount based upon the provisions of Subsection (a) above;
and
(2)     If the first installment payment has not yet been processed prior to the Participant’ s Separation
from Service, then the Participant’ s entire installment payment election shall be void and the Participant shall be paid a
single lump sum distribution for the Deferral Subaccount based upon the provisions of Subsection (a) above.
(c)    If the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at
such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not
be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Separation from Service, earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least 6
months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(d)    If a Participant has Separated from Service, the Participant’ s entire Account balance has been distributed under
this Article VI as a result of such Separation from Service, and later the Participant’ s Account is credited with a deferral of
compensation that was not available for credit before the time the Participant’ s Account was previously paid out ( e.g., Bonus
Compensation), then the new balance of such Participant’ s Account shall be distributed as a result of such prior Separation from
Service and the distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the calendar quarter that follows the
date that the deferral was credited to the Participant’ s Account, subject however to the rules of Subsection (c).
28
6.04     Distributions on Account of Death:
(a)    Upon a Participant’ s death, the value of the Participant’ s Account under the Plan shall be distributed in a single
lump sum payment on the first day of the calendar quarter beginning after the first anniversary of the Participant’ s death. Effective
January 1, 2019 and notwithstanding the preceding sentence, upon a Participant’ s death, the value of the Participant’ s Account
under the Plan shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment during the period that (i) begins on the first day of the calendar
quarter beginning after the Participant’ s death, and (ii) ends on December 31 of the year following the year of death. If the
Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s death, such installment payments shall continue in
accordance with the terms of the applicable deferral election that governs such payments until the time that the lump sum payment
is due to be paid under the applicable preceding sentence of this subsection. Immediately prior to the time that such lump sum
payment is scheduled to be paid, all installment payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Account shall
be distributed at such payment time in a single lump sum. Amounts paid following a Participant’ s death, whether a lump sum or
continued installments, shall be paid to the Participant’ s Beneficiary . If some but not all of the persons designated by a Participant
as Beneficiaries to receive his or her Account at death predecease the Participant, the Participant’ s surviving Beneficiaries shall be
entitled to the portion of the Participant’ s Account intended for such pre-deceased persons in proportion to the surviving
Beneficiaries’ respective shares.
(b)    If no Participant designation is in ef fect at the time of a Participant’ s death (as determined by the Plan
Administrator) or if all persons designated as Beneficiaries by the Participant have predeceased the Participant, then the payments
to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed as follows:
(1)    If the Participant is married (or for deaths on and after January 1, 2019, in a domestic partnership) at the
time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s surviving spouse or
surviving eligible domestic partner; and
(2) If the Participant is not married (or for deaths on and after January 1, 2019, in a domestic partnership)
at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s surviving children
in equal shares.
(3) If the Participant is not married (or for deaths on and after January 1, 2019, in a domestic partnership)
and does not have any living children at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section shall be paid
to the Participant’ s estate.
The Plan Administrator shall determine whether a Participant is “married” and shall determine a Participant’ s “spouse” based on
the state or local law where the Participant has his/her primary residence at the time of death. For these purposes, an “eligible
domestic partner” means the
29
individual, (i) with whom the Participant was in a valid civil union under state law at the time of the Participant’ s death, (ii) who
would satisfy the criteria to be enrolled in the Company’ s health benefits as the Participant’ s domestic partner at the time of the
Participant’ s death or (iii) who satisfies such other criteria of domestic partnership as the Plan Administrator has specified in
writing. The Plan Administrator is authorized to make any applicable inquires and to request any documents, certificates or other
information that it deems necessary or appropriate in order to make the above determinations.
(c)    Prior to the time the value of the Participant’ s Account is distributed under Subsection (a), the Participant’ s
Beneficiary may apply for a distribution under Section 6.07 (relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency).
(d)    Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’ s
death must be received by the Recordkeeper or the Plan Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is paid out by the
Recordkeeper . Any claim received thereafter is untimely , and it shall be unenforceable against the Plan, the Company , the Plan
Administrator , the Recordkeeper or any other party acting for one or more of them.
6.05     Distributions on Account of Retirement:
If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service on account of his or her Retirement, the Participant’ s Account shall be
distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section.
(a)    If the Participant’ s Retirement is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a Deferral Subaccount,
the Participant’ s deferral election pursuant to Sections 4.03, 4.04 or 4.05 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall continue to be given
effect, and the Deferral Subaccount shall be distributed based upon the provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) under Section 6.02,
whichever applies (relating to distributions based on a Specific Payment Date).
(b)    If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service,
distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first day of the calendar quarter following Retirement. Such
distribution shall be made in either a single lump sum payment or in installment payments depending upon the Participant’ s deferral
election under Sections 4.04 or 4.05. If the Participant is entitled to installment payments, such payments shall be made in
accordance with the Participant’ s installment election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 relating to
distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency) and with the installment payment amounts determined
under Section 6.08. However , if the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Retirement (or at
such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not
be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Retirement, earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least 6 months after the
Participant’ s Retirement.
30
(c)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments in accordance with Section 6.02 (relating to distributions on
account of a Specific Payment Date) for one or more Deferral Subaccounts at the time of his or her Retirement, such installment
payments shall continue to be paid based upon the Participant’ s deferral election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04,
6.06 and 6.07 relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
        
6.06     Distributions on Account of Disability:
If a Participant incurs a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Section.
(a)    The value of the Participant’ s Account under the Plan as of the most recent Distribution V aluation Date shall be
distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first date (i) on which the Participant is Disabled (determined without regard to the
duration requirement of the next clause), (ii) that is at least 12 months following the first date the Participant was Disabled from the
cause of the current Disability , and (iii) that is after the Participant has received payments from a PepsiCo disability plan (including
the PepsiCo Disability Plan) for the current cause of Disability (determined without regard to the duration requirement of this
clause).
(b)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s Disability , such installment
payments shall continue to be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Participant’ s applicable deferral election until the time
that the lump sum payment is due to be paid under the provisions of Subsection (a). Immediately prior to the time that such lump
sum payment is scheduled to be paid, all installment payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Account
shall be distributed at the time specified in Subsection (a) in a single lump sum.
6.07     Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emergency:
Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under Sections 6.02 through 6.06, a Participant or Beneficiary
may file a written request with the Recordkeeper for accelerated payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to the
Participant’ s Account based upon an Unforeseeable Emer gency . After an individual has filed a written request pursuant to this
Section, along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the Recordkeeper shall
determine within 60 days (or such other number of days that is necessary if special circumstances warrant additional time) whether
the individual meets the criteria for an Unforeseeable Emer gency . If the Recordkeeper determines that an Unforeseeable
Emer gency has occurred, the Participant or Beneficiary shall receive a distribution from his or her Account as of the day the
Recordkeeper finalizes the determination. However , such distribution shall not exceed the dollar amount necessary to satisfy the
Unforeseeable Emer gency (plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution) after taking
into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emer gency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by
insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the
31
Participant’ s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).
6.08     Valuation:
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount shall
continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the Distribution
Valuation Date that is used in determining the amount of the distribution under this Article. If a particular Section in this Article
does not specify a Distribution V aluation Date to be used in calculating the distribution, the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount shall
continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the Distribution
Valuation Date that precedes such distribution. In determining the value of a Participant’ s remaining Deferral Subaccount following
an installment distribution from the Deferral Subaccount (or a partial distribution under Section 6.07 relating to a distribution on
account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency), such distribution shall reduce the value of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of the
close of the Distribution V aluation Date preceding the payment date for such installment (or partial distribution). The amount to be
distributed in connection with any installment payment (other than a fixed amount elected under Section 4.04) shall be determined
by dividing the value of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of such preceding Distribution V aluation Date (determined before
reduction of the Deferral Subaccount as of such Distribution V aluation Date in accordance with the preceding sentence) by the
remaining number of installments to be paid with respect to the Deferral Subaccount. The amount distributed in connection with a
fixed dollar amount installment election shall be equal to the dollar amount elected and subject to the rules in Section 4.04.
6.09     Section 162(m) Compliance:
Notwithstanding Sections 6.01 through 6.07 of this Article, Plan distributions may be delayed in accordance with the
special rule in T reas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(7)(i) (the “162(m) Provision”). The 162(m) Provision’ s special rule permits distributions
to be delayed to the extent the Employer reasonably anticipates that, if the distribution were made as otherwise scheduled, the
Employer ’s deduction for the distribution would not be permitted as a result of Code Section 162(m). Use of the 162(m)
Provision’ s special rule is subject to conditions, including:
(a)     The Employer must treat all similarly situated employees on a reasonably consistent basis,
(b)     If the Employer delays a Plan distribution under the 162(m) Provision, the Employer must delay all payments
of deferred compensation to a Participant (including payments under other arrangements) that (i) could be delayed under the
162(m) Provision, and (ii) are scheduled to be paid to the Participant in the same tax year in which the delayed distribution was
scheduled to be paid, and
32
(c)    Distribution must be made in accordance with the schedule specified in the 162(m) Provision (including any
applicable six-month delay) once a distribution would be deductible taking into account Code Section 162(m).
6.10     Impact of Section 16 of the Act on Distributions:
The provisions of Sections 5.03(c) and 7.06 shall apply in determining whether a Participant’ s distribution shall be delayed
beyond the date applicable under the preceding provisions of this Article VI.
6.11    Actual Payment Date:
An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI shall be paid no later than the later of (a) the end of the calendar
year in which the specified date occurs, or (b) the 15th day of the third calendar month following such specified date. In addition,
the Participant (or Beneficiary) is not permitted to designate the taxable year of the payment.
33
Article VII – PLAN ADMINISTRATION
7.01     Plan Administrator:
The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has the authority to name
one or more delegates to carry out certain responsibilities hereunder , as specified in the definition of Plan Administrator . Any such
delegation shall state the scope of responsibilities being delegated and is subject to Section 7.06 below .
7.02     Action:
Action by the Plan Administrator may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Plan Administrator adopts from time
to time or that the Company’ s Law Department determines are legally permissible.
7.03     Powers of the Plan Administrator:
The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have (and shall be permitted to delegate) all powers
necessary to accomplish that purpose, including the following:
(a)    To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b)    To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility , participation and deferrals, to
make allocations and determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants’ Accounts;
(c)    To compute and certify to the Employers the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their
Beneficiaries, and to determine the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;
(d)    To authorize all disbursements by the Employer pursuant to this Plan;
(e)    To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
(f)    To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms hereof;
(g)    To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the performance of any of its duties or
responsibilities hereunder;
(h)    To establish or to change the phantom investment options or arrangements under Article V ;
34
(i)    To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and administering the
Plan; and
(j)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan except Section 7.07 (relating to compliance with Section
409A), the Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may take any action the Plan Administrator deems is necessary to assure
compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in ef fect from time to time. Such actions may
include altering the ef fective date of intra-fund transfers or the distribution date of Deferral Subaccounts. Any such actions shall
alter the normal operation of the Plan to the minimum extent necessary .
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be final
and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the
Plan Administrator , even if (1) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (2) a determination is
not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or call
for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the
applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal, any exercise of the Plan
Administrator ’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly shown to be arbitrary and capricious.
7.04     Compensation, Indemnity and Liability:
The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without compensation for services hereunder . All expenses of the Plan
and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Employers. To the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator , any such
expense may be char ged against specific Participant Accounts, thereby reducing the obligation of the Employers. No member of the
Committee (which serves as the Plan Administrator), and no individual acting as the delegate of the Committee, shall be liable for
any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or omission on his or her own part, excepting his or her own
willful misconduct. The Employers (other than the Company) will indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee
and any employee of the Company (or a Company af filiate, if recognized as an af filiate for this purpose by the Plan Administrator)
acting as the delegate of the Committee against any and all expenses and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
arising in connection with this Plan out of his or her membership on the Committee (or his or her serving as the delegate of the
Committee).
7.05     Withholding:
 
The Employer shall withhold from amounts due under this Plan, any amount necessary to enable the Employer to remit to
the appropriate government entity or entities on behalf of the Participant as may be required by the federal income tax provisions of
the Code, by an applicable
35
state’ s income tax provisions, and by an applicable city , county or municipality’ s earnings or income tax provisions. Further , the
Employer shall withhold from the payroll of, or collect from, a Participant the amount necessary to remit on behalf of the
Participant any Social Security or Medicare taxes which may be required with respect to amounts deferred or accrued by a
Participant hereunder , as determined by the Employer . In addition, to the extent required by Section 409A, amounts deferred under
this Plan shall be reported on each Participant’ s Form W -2 for the applicable tax year , and any amounts that become taxable
hereunder shall be reported as taxable wages on the Participant’ s Form W -2 for the applicable tax year . All such reporting shall be
performed based on the rules and procedures of Section 409A.
7.06     Section 16 Compliance:
(a)    In General . This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly , in the
case of a deferral or other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it
were approved by the Company’ s Board or Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan shall be
administered by delegates of the Compensation Committee, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in a
manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the
maximum possible extent.
(b)    Approval of Distributions : This subsection shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is wholly or partly
invested in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund at the time the deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash to
be distributed to a Participant, (ii) either was the subject of a Second Look Election or was not covered by an agreement, made at
the time of the Participant’ s original deferral election, that any investments in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would,
once made, remain in that fund until distribution of the deferral, (iii) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act
at the time the interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would be liquidated in connection with the distribution, and
(iv) if paid at the time the distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in a violation of Section 16 of
the Act because there is an opposite way transaction that would be matched with the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the
PepsiCo Common Stock Fund (either as a “discretionary transaction,” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular
transaction, as applicable) (a “Covered Distribution”). In the case of a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant’ s
interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the
time the distribution would be made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then the actual
distribution to the Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier of:
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the liquidation of
the Participant’ s interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution, and
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the Participant is no
longer subject to Section 16 of the Act, when the
36
Deferral Subaccount related to the distribution is no longer invested in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund or when
the time between the liquidation and an opposite way transaction is suf ficient.
7.07     Conformance with Section 409A:
Effective from and after January 1, 2009, at all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance
with the requirements of Section 409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt
from Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section
shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.
37
Article VIII – CLAIMS PROCEDURE
8.01     Claims for Benefits:
If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter , “Claimant”) does not receive timely payment of any benefits which
he or she believes are due and payable under the Plan, he or she may make a claim for benefits to the Plan Administrator . The claim
for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan Administrator . If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator
will notify the Claimant within 90 days after the Plan Administrator initially received the benefit claim. However , if special
circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to
the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-
day period. Any notice of a denial of benefits shall advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or
information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to appeal his or her
claim for benefits.
8.02     Appeals of Denied Claims:
Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written appeal for a review of his or her claim by the
Plan Administrator . The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she received the notice denying
his or her claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be communicated to the Claimant within 60 days after receipt of a
request for appeal. The notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan Administrator ’s decision. However , if special circumstances
require an extension of time for processing the appeal, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant
prior to the termination of the initial 60-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 60-day period.
In no event shall the Plan Administrator ’s decision be rendered later than 120 days after receipt of a request for appeal.
8.03     Special Claims Procedures for Disability Determinations:
Notwithstanding Sections 8.01 and 8.02, if the claim or appeal of the Claimant relates to Disability benefits, such claim or
appeal shall be processed pursuant to the applicable provisions of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 relating to
Disability benefits, including Sections 2560.503-1(d), 2560.503-1(f)(3), 2560.503-1(h)(4) and 2560.503-1(i)(3).
8.04     Effect of Specific References:
Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s
discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
38
8.05     Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:
Before filing any Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust
all of the Claimant’ s rights under the claims procedures of this Article.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 8.05 is intended to be
interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or ef fect this intent may
be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of the Plan’ s
claims procedure as described in this Section 8.05, the subsequent action or consideration shall be limited, to the maximum extent
permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 8.05 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes that are
not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights
the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of

Article IX – AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
9.01     Amendment of Plan:
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company , or its delegate or delegates, has the right in its
sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any manner , including the manner of making deferral
elections, the terms on which distributions are made, and the form and timing of distributions. However , except for mere clarifying
amendments necessary to avoid an inappropriate windfall, no Plan amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the Account of
any Participant as of the date such amendment is adopted. As of September 25, 2019, the Company’ s Executive V ice President and
Chief Human Resources Of ficer (or if such position is vacant or eliminated, the person who is acting to fulfill the majority of the
duties of the position (or plurality of the duties if no one is fulfilling a majority) as such duties existed immediately prior to the
vacancy or the position elimination) is delegated the responsibility to amend the Plan at any time and in any manner , except with
respect to those provisions of the Plan which relate to matters subject to Section 7.06. Any amendment shall be in writing and
adopted by the Committee or its delegate or delegates. All Participants and Beneficiaries shall be bound by such amendment. Any
amendments made to the Plan shall be subject to any restrictions on amendment that are applicable to ensure continued compliance
under Section 409A.
9.02     Termination of Plan:
(a)    The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The Company , acting by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or through its entire Board of Directors, reserves the right to discontinue and
terminate the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of
the United States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be
binding upon all af fected Participants) and their Beneficiaries, but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at
that time to any Participant’ s Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), the termination resolution shall provide for
how amounts theretofore credited to af fected Participants’ Accounts will be distributed.
(b)    This Section is subject to the same restrictions related to compliance with Section 409A that apply to Section 9.01. In
accordance with these restrictions, the Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to terminate the Plan and
make distributions in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A), and the maximum flexibility with respect
to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A) as is permissible under
Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a distribution may be made in connection with any
change in control with respect to deferrals made under this 409A Program.
42
Article X – MISCELLANEOUS
10.01     Limitation on Participant’s Rights:
Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be retained in the Employer ’s employ (or any right or
interest in this Plan or any assets of the Employer other than as herein provided). The Employer reserves the right to terminate the
employment of any Participant without any liability for any claim against the Employer under this Plan, except for a claim for
payment of deferrals as provided herein.
10.02     Unfunded Obligation of Individual Employer:
(a)    The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the
general assets of the Participant’ s individual Employer . Nothing contained in this Plan requires an Employer to set aside or hold in
trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary , nor any other
person shall have any property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific Employer asset. This Plan creates only a contractual
obligation on the part of a Participant’ s individual Employer , and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured creditor of
this Employer with respect to amounts of compensation deferred hereunder . Such a Participant shall not have any preference or
priority over the rights of any other unsecured general creditor of the Employer . No other Employer guarantees or shares such
obligation, and no other Employer shall have any liability to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary . In the event a Participant
transfers from the employment of one Employer to another , the former Employer shall transfer the liability for deferrals made while
the Participant was employed by that Employer to the new Employer (and the books of both Employers shall be adjusted
appropriately).
(b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (a), for purposes of this Section an “Employer” shall only refer to those
entities which are part of the PepsiCo Or ganization. If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo
Organization, the liability for deferrals made while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Or ganization shall remain with his
or her last Employer that was part of the PepsiCo Or ganization.
10.03     Other Plans:
This Plan shall not af fect the right of any Eligible Executive or Participant to participate in and receive benefits under and in
accordance with the provisions of any other employee benefit plans which are now or hereafter maintained by any Employer ,
unless the terms of such other employee benefit plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it would cause such other plan to
violate a requirement for tax favored treatment.
10.04     Receipt or Release:
Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction
of all claims against the Plan Administrator , the
43
Recordkeeper , the Company , and all Employers, and the Plan Administrator may require such Participant, as a condition precedent
to such payment, to execute a receipt and release to such ef fect.
10.05     Governing Law:
This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with applicable federal law and, to
the extent not preempted by federal law , in accordance with the laws of the State of New Y ork. If any provisions of this instrument
shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to
be fully ef fective.
10.06     Adoption of Plan by Related Employers:
The Plan Administrator may select as an Employer (other than the Company , which is automatically an Employer
hereunder) any division of the Company , as well as any subsidiary or af filiate related to the Company by ownership (and that is a
member of the PepsiCo Or ganization), and permit or cause such division, subsidiary or af filiate to adopt the Plan. The selection by
the Plan Administrator shall govern the ef fective date of the adoption of the Plan by such related Employer . The requirements for
Plan adoption are entirely within the discretion of the Plan Administrator and, in any case where the status of an entity as an
Employer is at issue, the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be absolutely conclusive.
10.07     Gender, Tense and Examples:
In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or plural number and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender
shall be deemed to include the other . Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific
item or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passage of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without
limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of
application).
10.08     Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits:
This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided,
however , that the amounts credited to the Account of a Participant are not (except as provided in Sections 5.06 and 7.05) subject in
any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge, encumbrance, char ge, garnishment, execution or levy of
any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber , char ge or
otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits payable hereunder , including, without limitation, any assignment or alienation in
connection with a separation, divorce, child support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the
Company or any Employer . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to make payments in
accordance with a divorce decree, judgment or other court order as and when cash payments are made in accordance with the terms
44
of this Plan from the Deferral Subaccount of a Participant. Any such payment shall be char ged against and reduce the Participant’ s
Account.
10.09     Facility of Payment:
Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any payment hereunder is
under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his or her financial af fairs, the Plan
Administrator may direct the Employer to make payments to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his or her
benefit, or to apply the payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Plan Administrator considers advisable. Any
payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of such
payment to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan.

ARTICLE I
INTRODUCTION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”) established the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program in 1972 to permit eligible
executives to defer certain cash awards made under its executive compensation programs. Subsequently, the PepsiCo
Executive Income Deferral Program (the “Plan”) was expanded to permit eligible executives to defer base pay, certain other
categories of executive compensation and gains on Performance Share Stock Options.
Except as otherwise provided, this document sets forth the terms of the Plan as in effect on July 1, 1997. As of that
date, it specifies the group of executives of the Company and certain affiliated employers eligible to make deferrals, the
procedures for electing to defer compensation and the Plan’s provisions for maintaining and paying out amounts that have
been deferred. Additional provisions applicable to certain executives are set forth in the Appendix, which modifies and
supplements the general provisions of the Plan.
Deferrals under the Plan that were earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 are governed by a set of
documents (which includes this document) that set forth the pre-Section 409A terms of the Plan (the “Pre-409A Program”). .
This document for the Pre-409A Program was most recently restated effective as of January 1, 2019. The terms of the Plan
that are applicable to deferrals that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally, deferred amounts that are earned or vested after
December 31, 2004 (the “409A Program”) are governed by a separate document. The 409A Program document reflects the
provisions in effect from and after January 1, 2005, and the rights and benefits of individuals who are participants in the Plan
from and after that date (and of those claiming through or on behalf of such individuals) shall be governed by the provisions
of the 409A Program document and not the Pre-409A Program documents in the case of actions and events occurring on or
after January 1, 2005 with respect to deferrals that are subject to the 409A Program. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
the term “actions and events” shall include all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and benefits with respect to
persons who only participated in the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by this document and the other applicable
provisions of the Pre-409A Program documents that were in effect at such time, and shall not be governed by the 409A
Program documents.
Together, the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a
single plan. However, amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A
Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material
modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to
permit the Pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A, and the administration of the Plan shall be consistent with
this intent.
1
The Plan is unfunded and unsecured. Amounts deferred by an executive are an obligation of that executive’s individual
employer. With respect to his employer, the executive has the rights of a general creditor.
2
ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
When used in this Plan, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless a different
meaning is plainly required by the context:
2.1 Account: The account maintained for a Participant on the books of his Employer to determine, from time to time,
the Participant's interest under this Plan. The balance in such Account shall be determined by the Plan Administrator. Each
Participant's Account shall consist of at least one Deferral Subaccount for each separate deferral under Section 3.2. In
accordance with Section 4.3, some or all of a separate deferral may be held in a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount. The Plan
Administrator may also establish such additional subaccounts as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan.
Where appropriate, a reference to a Participant’s Account shall include a reference to each applicable subaccount that has been
established thereunder.
2.2 Base Compensation: An eligible Employee’s adjusted base salary, as determined by the Plan Administrator and to
the extent paid in U.S. dollars from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. For any applicable payroll period, an eligible Employee’s
adjusted base salary shall be determined after reductions for applicable tax withholdings, Employee authorized deductions
(including deductions for SaveUp, Benefits Plus and charitable donations), tax levies, garnishments and such other amounts as
the Plan Administrator recognizes as reducing the amount of base salary available for deferral.
2.3 Beneficiary: The person or persons (including a trust or trusts) properly designated by a Participant, as determined
by the Plan Administrator, to receive the amounts in one or more of the Participant’s subaccounts in the event of the
Participant's death. To be effective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and filed with
the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant’s death, and it must meet such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall
require from time to time. If no designation is in effect at the time of a Participant's death or if all designated Beneficiaries
have predeceased the Participant, then the Participant’s Beneficiary shall be his estate. A Beneficiary designation of an
individual by name (or name and relationship) remains in effect regardless of any change in the designated individual’s
relationship to the Participant. A Beneficiary designation solely by relationship (for example, a designation of “spouse,” that
does not give the name of the spouse) shall designate whoever is the person in that relationship to the Participant at his death.
An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary with respect to a Participant’s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all
payments have been made from the Account.
2.4 Bonus Compensation: An eligible Employee’s adjusted annual incentive award under his Employer’s annual
incentive plan or the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, as determined and adjusted by the Plan Administrator and to the
extent paid in U.S. dollars
3
from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. An eligible Employee’s annual incentive awards shall be adjusted to reduce them for
applicable tax withholdings, Employee authorized deductions (including deductions for SaveUp, Benefits Plus and charitable
donations), tax levies, garnishments and such other amounts as the Plan Administrator recognizes as reducing the amount of
such awards available for deferral.
2.5 Code: The Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
2.6 Company: PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, or its successor or successors.
2.7 Deferral Subaccount: A subaccount of a Participant'’s Account maintained to reflect his interest in the Plan
attributable to each deferral of Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout and Stock Option Gains,
respectively, and earnings or losses credited to such subaccount in accordance with Section 4.1(b).
2.8 Disability: A Participant who is entitled to receive benefits under the PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan shall be
deemed to suffer from a disability. Participants who are not eligible to participate in the PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan
shall be deemed to suffer from a disability if, in the judgment of the Plan Administrator, they satisfy the standards for
disability under the PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan.
2.9 Effective Date: July 1, 1997.
2.10 Election Form: The form prescribed by the Plan Administrator on which a Participant specifies the amount of his
Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout or Stock Option Gains to be deferred pursuant to the
provisions of Article III.
2.11 Employee: Any person in a salaried classification of an Employer who (i) is receiving remuneration for personal
services rendered in the employment of the Employer, (ii) is either a United States citizen or a resident alien lawfully admitted
for permanent residence in the United States, and (iii) is paid in U.S. dollars from the Employer’s U.S. payroll.
2.12 Employer: Each division of the Company and each of the Company’s subsidiaries and affiliates that is currently
designated as an Employer by the Plan Administrator.
2.13 ERISA: The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

PepsiCo Capital Stock
4
as reported on the principal exchange on which PepsiCo Capital Stock is traded as of the time in question, rounded to four
decimal places. For purposes of determining the value of a Plan distribution or for reallocating amounts between phantom
investment options under the Plan, the Fair Market Value of PepsiCo Capital Stock is determined as the closing price on the
applicable Valuation Date (identified based on the Plan Administrator’s current procedures) for PepsiCo Capital Stock, as
reported on the principal exchange on which PepsiCo Capital Stock is traded as of the time in question, rounded to four
decimal places.
2.15 Participant: Any Employee eligible pursuant to Section 3.1 who has satisfied the requirements for participation in
this Plan and who has an Account. A Participant includes any individual who deferred compensation prior to the Effective
Date and for whom any Employer maintains on its books an Account for such deferred compensation as of the Effective Date.
An active Participant is one who is currently deferring under Section 3.2.
2.16 Performance Unit Payout: The adjusted performance unit award payable to an Employee under the Company’s
Long Term Incentive Plan during a Plan Year, to the extent paid in U.S. dollars from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. An eligible
Employee’s performance unit award shall be adjusted to reduce it for applicable tax withholdings, Employee authorized
deductions, tax levies, garnishments and such other amounts as the Plan Administrator recognizes as reducing the amount of
such awards available for deferral.
2.17 Plan: The PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program, the plan set forth herein and in the 409A Program
document, as it may be amended and restated from time to time (subject to the limitations on amendment that are applicable
hereunder and under the 409A Program). The portion of the Plan that governs deferrals that are subject to Section 409A is
referred to as the “409A Program,” while the portion of the Plan that governs deferrals that are not subject to Section 409A,
which includes this document, is referred to as the “Pre-409A Program.”

addition, the Company’s Senior Vice President, Total Rewards, or if such position is vacant or eliminated, the person who is
acting to fulfill the majority of the duties of the position (or plurality of the duties if no one is fulfilling a majority) as such
duties existed immediately prior to the vacancy or the position elimination, is delegated the responsibility for the operational
administration of the Plan, including the powers set forth in Section 5.3 and Article VI. In turn, such Senior Vice President,
has the authority to re-delegate operational responsibilities to other persons or parties. All delegations made under the
authority granted by this Section are subject to Section 5.6.
2.19 Plan Year: The 12-month period from January 1 to December 31.
5

deferral that is subject to forfeiture.
2.22 Section 409A: Section 409A of the Code and the applicable regulations and other guidance of general
applicability that are issued thereunder.
2.23 Stock Option Gains: The gains on an eligible Employee’s Performance Share Stock Options that are available for
deferral under the Plan pursuant to Section 3.3(c). With respect to any options that are made subject to a Stock Option Gain
deferral election, the gains on such options shall be determined through a sale of related shares by the Plan Administrator net
of: (i) the exercise price of the options, (ii) any transaction costs incurred when such gains are captured through the sale of
related shares, and (iii) any related taxes that the Plan Administrator determines will not otherwise be satisfied by the
Participant. For purposes of such sales, the Plan Administrator may aggregate shares related to the options of different
Participants, sell them over one or more days and divide the net proceeds from such aggregate sales between the Participants
in a reasonable manner. The Plan Administrator shall have absolute discretion with respect to the timing and aggregation of
such sales.
2.24 Termination of Employment: A Participant’s cessation of employment with the Company, all Employers and all
other Company subsidiaries and affiliates (as defined for this purpose by the Plan Administrator). For purposes of determining
forfeitures under Section 4.3 and distributing a Participant’s Account under Section 4.4, the following shall apply:
(a) A Participant does not have a Termination of Employment when the business unit or division of the
Company that employs him is sold if the Participant and substantially all employees of that entity continue to be
employed by the entity or its successor after the sale. A Participant also does not have a Termination of Employment
when the subsidiary of the Company that employs him is sold if: (i) the Participant continues to be employed by the
entity or its successor after the sale, and (ii) the Participant’s interest in the Plan continues to be carried as a liability by
that entity or its successor after the sale through a successor arrangement. In each case, the Participant’s Termination of
Employment shall occur upon the Participant’s post-sale termination of employment from such entity or its successor
(and their related organizations, as determined by the Plan Administrator).
6
(b) With respect to any individual deferral, the term “Termination of Employment” may encompass a
Participant’s death or death may be considered a separate event, depending upon the convention the Plan Administrator
follows with respect to such deferral.
2.25 Valuation Date: Each date as of which Participant Accounts are valued in accordance with procedures of the Plan
Administrator that are currently in effect. As of the Effective Date, the Valuation Dates are March 31, June 30, September 30

ARTICLE III
PARTICIPATION
3.1 Eligibility to Participate.
(a) An Employee shall be eligible to defer compensation under the Plan while employed by an Employer
at salary grade level 14 or above. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, from time to time the Plan Administrator
may modify, limit or expand the class of Employees eligible to defer hereunder, pursuant to criteria for eligibility that
need not be uniform among all or any group of Employees. During the period an individual satisfies all of the
eligibility requirements of this section, he shall be referred to as an eligible Employee.
(b) Each eligible Employee becomes an active Participant on the date an amount is first withheld from
his compensation pursuant to an Election Form submitted by the Employee to the Plan Administrator under Section
3.3.
(c) An individual’s eligibility to participate actively by making deferrals under Section 3.2 shall cease
upon the earlier of:
(1) The date he ceases to be an Employee who is employed by an Employer at salary grade level
14 or above; or
(2) The date the Employee ceases to be eligible under criteria described in the last sentence of
subsection (a) above.
(d) An individual, who has been an active Participant under the Plan, ceases to be a Participant on the
date his Account is fully paid out.
3.2 Deferral Election.
(a) Each eligible Employee may make an election to defer under the Plan any whole percentage (up to
100%) of his Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout or Stock Option Gains in the
manner described in Section 3.3. Any percentage of Base Compensation deferred by an eligible Employee for a Plan
Year will be deducted each pay period during the Plan Year for which he has Base Compensation and is an eligible
Employee. The percentage of Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout deferred by an Eligible Employee for
a Plan Year will be deducted from his payment under the applicable compensation program at the time it would
otherwise be made, provided he remains an eligible Employee at such time. Any Stock Option Gains deferred by an
eligible Employee shall be captured as of the date or dates applicable for the
8
category of underlying options under procedures adopted by the Plan Administrator, provided that the Plan
Administrator determines the eligible Employee’s rights in such options may still be recognized at such time.
(b) To be effective, an Eligible Employee’s Election Form must set forth the percentage of Base
Compensation, Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout to be deferred (or for a deferral of Stock Option
Gains, the specific options on which any gains are to be deferred), the investment choice under Section 4.1 (which
investment must be stated in multiples of 5 percent), the deferral period under Section 3.4, the eligible Employee’s
Beneficiary designation, and any other information that may be requested by the Plan Administrator from time to time.
In addition, the Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 3.3 below.
3.3 Time and Manner of Deferral Election.
(a) Deferrals of Base Compensation. Subject to the next two sentences, an eligible Employee
must make a deferral election for a Plan Year with respect to Base Compensation at least two months prior to the Plan
Year in which the Base Compensation would otherwise be paid. An individual who newly becomes an eligible
Employee during a Plan Year (or less than three months prior to a Plan Year) may make a deferral election with respect
to Base Compensation to be paid during the balance of the current Plan Year within 30 days of the date the individual
becomes an eligible Employee. Such an individual may also make an election at this time with respect to Base
Compensation to be paid during the next Plan Year.
(b) Deferrals of Bonuses and Performance Unit Payouts. Subject to the next sentence, an eligible
Employee must make a deferral election for a Plan Year with respect to his Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit
Payout at least six months prior to the Plan Year in which the Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout would
otherwise be paid. An individual who newly becomes an eligible Employee may make a deferral election with respect
to his Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout to be paid during the succeeding Plan Year later than the date
applicable under the previous sentence so long as the deferral election is made: (i) within 30 days of the date the
individual becomes an eligible Employee, and (ii) sufficiently prior to the first day of such succeeding Plan Year to
ensure, in the discretionary judgment of the Plan Administrator, that the amount to be deferred will not have been
constructively received (under all the facts and circumstances).
(c) Deferrals of Stock Option Gains. From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall notify eligible
Employees with outstanding Performance Share Options which options then qualify for deferral of their related Stock
Option Gains. An eligible Employee who has qualifying options must make a deferral election with respect to his
related Stock Option Gains at least 6 months before such qualifying options’ proposed capture date (as defined below)
or, if earlier, in the calendar year
9
preceding the year of the proposed capture date. The “proposed capture date” for a set of options shall be the earliest
date that the Plan Administrator would capture a Participant’s Stock Option Gains in accordance with the deferral
agreement prepared for such purpose by the Plan Administrator.
(d) General Provisions. A separate deferral election under (a), (b) or (c) above must be made by
an eligible Employee for each category of a Plan Year’s compensation that is eligible for deferral. If an eligible
Employee fails to file a properly completed and executed Election Form with the Plan Administrator by the prescribed
time, he will be deemed to have elected not to defer any Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit
Payout or Stock Option Gains, as the case may be, for the applicable Plan Year. An election is irrevocable once
received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed. Increases or decreases in the amount or
percentage a Participant elects to defer shall not be permitted during a Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding three
sentences, to the extent necessary because of extraordinary circumstances, the Plan Administrator may grant an
extension of any election period and may permit (to the extent necessary to avoid undue hardship to an eligible
Employee) the complete revocation of an election with respect to future deferrals. Any such extension or revocation
shall be available only if the Plan Administrator determines that it shall not trigger constructive receipt of income and
is desirable for plan administration, and only upon such conditions as may be required by the Plan Administrator.
(e) Beneficiaries. A Participant designates on the Election Form a Beneficiary to receive payment
in the event of his death of amounts credited to his subaccount for such deferral. A Beneficiary is paid in accordance
with the terms of a Participant's Election Form, as interpreted by the Plan Administrator in accordance with the terms
of this Plan. At any time, a Participant may change a Beneficiary designation for any or all subaccounts in a writing
that is signed by the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant’s death, and that meets
such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time.
3.4 Period of Deferral. An eligible Employee making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his Election
Form by designating a specific payout date, one or more specific payout events or both a date and one or more specific events
from the choices that are made available to the eligible Employee by the Plan Administrator. From time to time in its
discretion, the Plan Administrator may condition a Participant’s right to designate one or more specific payout events on the
Participant’s also specifying a payout date. Subject to the next sentence, an eligible Employee’s elected period of deferral shall
run until the earliest occurring date or event specified on his Election Form. Notwithstanding an eligible Employee’s actual
election, an eligible Employee shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than:
10
(a) For Base Compensation, at least 6 months after the Plan Year during which the Base Compensation
would have been paid absent the deferral;
(b) For Bonus Compensation, at least 1 year after the date the Bonus Compensation would have been
paid absent the deferral;
(c) For Performance Unit Payouts, at least 1 year after the date the Performance Unit Payout would have
been paid absent the deferral; and
(d) For Stock Option Gains, at least 1 year after the date the Stock Option Gain is credited to a Deferral
Subaccount for the benefit of the Participant.
11
ARTICLE IV
INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
4.1 Accounting for Participants’ Interests.
(a) Deferral Subaccounts. Each Participant shall have a separate Deferral Subaccount credited
with the amount of each separate deferral of Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout or
Stock Option Gains made by the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’s deferral shall be credited to his Account as
soon as practicable following the date when the deferral of compensation actually occurs, as determined by the Plan
Administrator. A Participant’s Account is a bookkeeping device to track the value of his deferrals (and his Employer’s
liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any Account, and no Account shall be
insured or otherwise secured.
(b) Account Earnings or Losses. As of each Valuation Date, a Participant’s Account shall be
credited with earnings and gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to
his Account had actually been invested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this section (as modified by
Section 4.3, if applicable). The Plan provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such earnings, gains,
expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However, they shall be applied to measure the value of a
Participant’s Account and the amount of his Employer’s liability to make deferred payments to or on behalf of the
Participant.
    
(c) Investment Options. Each of a Participant’s Subaccounts (other than those containing
Stock Option Gains) shall be invested on a phantom basis in any combination of phantom investment options
specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’s death, by his Beneficiary) from those offered by the
Plan Administrator for this purpose from time to time. Subsection (e) below governs the phantom investment
options available for deferrals of Stock Option Gains. The Plan Administrator may discontinue any phantom
investment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide for shifting a Participant’s phantom
investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects
another replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan Administrator may apply). As of
the Effective Date, the phantom investment options are:
(1) Interest Bearing Account.
(i) Effective from and after December 29, 2006, Participant Accounts
invested in this phantom option accrue a return based upon an interest rate that is 120% of the applicable
Federal long-
12
term rate (pursuant to Code Section 1274(d) or any successor provision) applicable for annual
compounding, as published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from time to time. Returns accrue
during the period since the last Valuation Date based upon 120% of the applicable Federal long-term rate
(applicable for annual compounding) in effect on the first business day after such Valuation Date and are
compounded annually. An amount deferred or transferred into this option is credited with the applicable
rate of return beginning with the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the
Plan Administrator.
(ii) Effective for periods ending on December 28, 2006, Participant
Accounts invested in this phantom option accrue a return based upon the prime rate of interest
announced from time to time by Citibank, N.A. (or another bank designated by the Plan Administrator
from time to time). Returns accrue during the period since the last Valuation Date based on the prime
rate in effect on the first business day after such Valuation Date and are compounded annually. An
amount deferred or transferred into this option is credited with the applicable rate of return beginning
with the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator.
(iii) Amounts that are invested in the phantom option under clause (ii)
above at the end of the day on December 28, 2006 shall be transferred to the phantom investment option
under clause (i) above effective as of the beginning of the day on December 29, 2006, and thereafter the
phantom investment option under clause (ii) above shall be terminated.
(iv) For the periods during which the phantom investment options under
clauses (i) and (ii) above are in effect, such phantom investment options are the “default” option to the
extent a default option is needed in order to make certain a Participant’s Account is 100% invested.
(2) PepsiCo Capital Stock Account. Participant Accounts invested in this phantom
option are adjusted to reflect an investment in PepsiCo Capital Stock. An amount deferred or transferred into
this option is converted to phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock of equivalent value by dividing such
amount by the Fair Market Value of a share of PepsiCo Capital Stock on the date as of which the amount is
treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator. Only whole shares are determined. Any remaining
amount (and all amounts that would be received by the Account as dividends,
13
if dividends were paid on phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock as they are on actual shares) are credited to
a dividend subaccount that is invested in the phantom option in paragraph (1) above (the Interest Bearing
Account).
(i) A Participant’s interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account is valued
as of a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom shares credited to his Account on such
date by the Fair Market Value of a share of PepsiCo Capital Stock on such date, and then adding the
value of the Participant’s dividend subaccount.
(ii) If shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock change by reason of any stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spinoff, combination or exchange of shares or
other any other corporate change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator, such
equitable adjustment shall be made in the number of shares credited to an Account or subaccount as the
Plan Administrator may determine to be necessary or appropriate.
In no event will shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no
Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of PepsiCo Capital Stock on account of an interest in this
phantom option. While this Plan refers to PepsiCo Capital Stock and the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock
Account, such references to capital stock shall mean and refer to PepsiCo common stock from and after the date
when the Company changed to a common stock structure.
(3) SaveUp Accounts. From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate
which, if any, of the investment options under the PepsiCo Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”) (previously know
as the Company’s Long Term Savings Plan (“SaveUp”) shall be available as phantom investment options under
this Plan. Participant Accounts invested in these phantom options are adjusted to reflect an investment in the
corresponding investment options under the Savings Plan. An amount deferred or transferred into one of these
options is converted to phantom units in the applicable Savings Plan fund of equivalent value by dividing such
amount by the value of a unit in such fund on the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this
option by the Plan Administrator. Thereafter, a Participant’s interest in each such phantom option is valued as of
a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom units credited to his Account on such date by the value
of a unit in the applicable Savings Plan fund.
(d) Method of Allocation. With respect to any deferral election by a Participant, the Participant must use
his Election Form to allocate the deferral in increments permitted by the Plan Administrator among the phantom
investment
14
options then offered by the Plan Administrator. Thereafter, a Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in
a subaccount by properly completing and submitting a fund transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator and
specifying, in increments permitted by the Plan Administrator, the reallocation of his Subaccount among the phantom
investment options then offered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose. Effective as of January 1, 2020, the
increments permitted by the Plan Administrator are whole percentages, whole shares or whole dollars, as specified in the
fund transfer forms (or other materials) provided to Participants and authorized by the Plan Administrator . Any such
transfer form shall be effective as of the Valuation Date that follows its receipt by at least the number of days that the
Plan Administrator specifies for this purpose from time to time. If more than one transfer form is received on a timely
basis for a subaccount, the transfer form that the Plan Administrator determines to be the most recent shall be followed.
(e) Investment Choices for Stock Option Gains. Deferrals of Stock Option gains initially may be
invested only in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account. In the case of a Participant who has attained his Retirement or,
effective as of September 12, 2008, upon a Participant’s death or Disability, the Plan Administrator may make available
some or all of the other phantom investment options described in subsection (c) above. In this case, any election to
reallocate the balance in the Participant’s applicable Deferral Subaccount shall be governed by the foregoing provisions
of this section.
4.2 Vesting of a Participant’s Account. Except as provided in Section 4.3, a Participant’s interest in the value of his
Account shall at all times be 100 percent vested, which means that it will not forfeit as a result of his Termination of
Employment.
4.3 Risk of Forfeiture Subaccounts. A Participant may elect to defer Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation or
Performance Unit Payouts to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount only if: (i) he had, as of June 1, 1994, a deferred compensation
subaccount maintained under a forfeiture agreement (as defined below), and (ii) he has not yet attained eligibility for
Retirement when the first amount would be deferred pursuant to his current risk-of-forfeiture election. A “forfeiture
agreement” is an agreement with the Company, any Employer, or one of their predecessors providing that the subaccount
would be forfeited if the employee terminated employment voluntarily or on account of misconduct prior to Retirement. A
Participant who meets these requirements may elect under Article III to defer some or all of his eligible compensation to a
Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount subject to the following terms. (The date when a Participant attains eligibility for Retirement is
specified in the definition of “Retirement.”)
(a) A Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount will be terminated and forfeited in the event that the
Participant has a Termination of Employment that is voluntary or because of his misconduct prior to the earliest of:
15
(1) The end of the deferral period designated in his Election Form for such deferral (or if
later, the end of such minimum period as may be required under Section 3.4);
(2) The date the Participant attains eligibility for Retirement; or
(3) The date indicated on his Election Form as the end of the risk of forfeiture condition
(but not before completing the minimum risk of forfeiture period required by the Plan Administrator from time
to time).
(b) A Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount shall become fully vested (and shall cease to be a Risk of Forfeiture
Subaccount) when:
(1) The Participant reaches any of the dates in subsection (a) above while still employed by the
Company or one of its affiliates, or
(2) On the date the Participant terminates involuntarily from his Employer (including death and
termination for Disability), provided that such termination is not for his misconduct.
    
(c) No amounts credited to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may be transferred to a subaccount of the
Participant that is not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount. No amounts credited to a subaccount of the Participant that is
not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may be transferred to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.
(d) A Participant may initially direct and then reallocate his Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount to any of the
phantom investment options under the Plan that are currently available for such direction or reallocation, whichever
applies. During the period before a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount ceases to be a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount, the
return under any such phantom investment option shall be supplemented as follows.
(1) In the case of the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account, the Participant’s dividend subaccount
thereunder shall be credited with an additional year-end dividend amount equal to 2 percent of the average
closing price of PepsiCo Capital Stock for the 30 business days preceding the end of the Company’s fiscal year
multiplied by the number of phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock credited to the Participant’s Account as
of the end of the year. If the Participant’s subaccount was not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount for the entire year
(or if the Participant reallocated amounts to the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account after the beginning of the year),
this 2 percent additional dividend will be prorated down appropriately, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
In addition, the Participant’s dividend subaccount shall earn interest at a rate that is 2 percent above the rate
ordinarily applicable
16
under the Interest Bearing Account for the period that it is contained within a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.
(2) In the case of any other available phantom investment option, the return on each such option
shall be supplemented with an additional 2% annual return for the period that it is held within a Risk of
Forfeiture Subaccount (but prorated for periods of such investment of less than a year).
4.4 Distribution of a Participant’s Account. A Participant’s Account shall be distributed in cash as provided in this
Section 4.4.
(a) Scheduled Payout Date. With respect to a specific deferral, a Participant’s “Scheduled Payout Date”
shall be the earlier of:
(1) The date selected by the Participant for such deferral in accordance with Section 3.4, or
(2) The first day of the calendar quarter that follows the earliest to occur event selected by the
Participant for such deferral in accordance with Section 3.4.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence, in the case of a deferral of Stock Option Gains, a Participant’s Scheduled Payout
Date for such deferral shall be first day of the calendar quarter following his Termination of Employment other than for
death, Disability or Retirement (or 12 months after the date of the deferral, if that would be later than such first day).
With respect to any deferral, if a Participant selects only a payout event that might not occur (such as Retirement) and
then terminates employment before the occurrence of the event, the Plan Administrator may adopt rules to specify the
Scheduled Payout Date that shall apply to the deferral, notwithstanding the terms of the Participant’s election. Unless
an election has been made in accordance with subsection (b) below, the Participant’s subaccount containing the deferral
shall be distributed to the Participant in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following the Scheduled Payout Date.
(b) Payment Election. A Participant may delay receipt of a subaccount beyond its Scheduled Payout
Date, or elect to receive installments rather than a lump sum, by making a payment election under this subsection. A
payment election must be made by the calendar year before the year containing the Scheduled Payout Date (or if
earlier, at least 6 months before the Scheduled Payout Date). Any payment election to receive a lump sum at a later
time must specify a revised payout date that is at least 12 months after the Scheduled Payout Date. Any payment
election to receive installment payments in lieu of a lump sum shall specify the amount (or method for determining)
each installment and a set of revised payout dates, the last of
17
which must be at least 12 months after the Scheduled Payout Date. With respect to any subaccount, only one election
may be made under this subsection. Beneficiaries are not permitted to make elections under this subsection. In
addition, an election under this subsection may not delay the distribution of a deferral of Stock Option Gains made by a
Participant whose employment has terminated other than for death, Disability or Retirement. Actual payments shall be
made as soon as practicable following a revised payout date.
(c) Valuation. In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to subsection (a) or (b)
above, the Participant’s subaccount shall continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and
losses) under Sections 4.1 and 4.3 until the Valuation Date preceding the Scheduled Payout Date or revised payout date
for such distribution (whichever is applicable). In determining the value of a Participant’s remaining subaccount
following an installment distribution, such installment distribution shall reduce the value of the Participant’s
subaccount as of the close of the Valuation Date preceding the revised payout date for such installment.
(d) Limitations. The following limitations apply to distributions from the Plan.
(1) Installments may only be made quarterly, semi-annually or annually, for a period of no more
than 20 years, and not later than the Participant’s 80th birthday (or what would have been his 80th birthday, if
the Participant dies earlier).
(2) If a Participant has elected a Scheduled Payout Date that would be after his 80th birthday, the
Participant shall be deemed to have elected his 80th birthday as his Scheduled Payout Date.
(3) If a Participant has elected to defer income, which would qualify as performance-based
compensation under Code section 162(m), into a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount, then such subaccount may not
be paid out at any time while the Participant is a covered employee under Code section 162(m)(3), to the extent
the Plan Administrator determines it would result in compensation being paid to the Participant in such year that
would not be deductible under Code section 162(m). The payout of any such amount shall be deferred until a
year when the Participant is no longer a section 162(m) covered employee. The Plan Administrator may waive
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph to the extent necessary to avoid an undue hardship to the Participant.
This paragraph shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary.
18
(e) Upon a Participant’s death, his Beneficiary shall be paid each subaccount still standing to the
Participant’s credit under the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Participant’s payout election for such subaccount
under Section 3.4, or his payment election under subsection (b) above, whichever is applicable.
4.5 Acceleration of Payment in Certain Cases. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4.5, no payments shall be
made under this Plan prior to the date (or dates) applicable under Section 4.4.
(a) A Participant who is suffering severe financial hardship resulting from extraordinary and
unforeseeable events beyond the control of the Participant (and who does not have other funds reasonably available
that could satisfy the severe financial hardship) may file a written request with the Plan Administrator for accelerated
payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to his Account. The Plan Administrator shall have sole discretion to
determine whether a Participant satisfies the requirements for a hardship request and the amount that may be
distributed (which shall not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to alleviate the Participant’s hardship).
(b) After a Participant has filed a written request pursuant to this section, along with all supporting
material, the Plan Administrator shall grant or deny the request within 60 days (or such other number of days as is
customarily applied from time to time) unless special circumstances warrant additional time.
(c) The Plan Administrator may adjust the standards for hardship withdrawals from time to time to the
extent it determines such adjustment to be necessary to avoid triggering constructive receipt of income under the Plan.
(d) A Beneficiary may also request a hardship distribution upon satisfaction of the foregoing
requirements and subject to the foregoing limitations.
(e) When determined to be necessary in the interest of sound plan administration, the Plan Administrator
may accelerate the payment of a class of Participants’ subaccounts hereunder. This shall only occur to the extent the
Plan Administrator determines that such acceleration will not trigger constructive receipt of subaccounts that are not
paid out.
(f) When some or all of a Participant’s subaccount is distributed pursuant to this section, the distribution
and the subaccount shall be valued as provided by the Plan Administrator, using rules patterned after those in Section
4.4(c) above, on the Valuation Date coincident with or immediately preceding the date on which the decision to make
accelerated payment is made (or if later, the date on which it is deemed to be effective).

ARTICLE V
PLAN ADMINISTRATOR
5.1 Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan
Administrator has authority to name one or more delegates to carry out certain responsibilities hereunder, as specified in the
definition of Plan Administrator. Any such delegation shall state the responsibilities being delegated and is subject to Section
5.6 below.
5.2 Action. Action by the Committee may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Committee adopts from
time to time or that the Company’s Law Department determines are legally permissible.
5.3 Rights and Duties. The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have all powers
necessary to accomplish that purpose, including (but not limited to) the following:
(a) To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b) To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility, participation and
deferrals, to make allocations and determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants'
Accounts;
(c) To compute and certify to the Employer the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their
Beneficiaries, and to determine the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;
(d) To authorize all disbursements by the Employer pursuant to this Plan;
(e) To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
(f) To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms
hereof;
(g) To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the performance of any of its duties or
responsibilities hereunder;
(h) To establish or to change the phantom investment options or arrangements under Article IV; and
20
(i) To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and
administering the Plan.
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan except Section 8.5 (relating to compliance with
Section 409A), the Plan Administrator may take any action the Plan Administrator deems is necessary to assure
compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in effect from time to time. Such
actions may include altering the effective date of phantom investment option transfers or the distribution date of
Deferral Subaccounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of the Plan to the minimum extent necessary.
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be
final and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted
discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (A) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or
(B) a determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions
expressly grant discretion or call for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan
Administrator decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or
any other tribunal, any exercise of the Plan Administrator’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly
shown to be arbitrary and capricious. Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator’s discretion shall create no
inference that the Plan Administrator’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less
complete or broad.
5.4 Compensation, Indemnity and Liability. The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without
compensation for services hereunder. All expenses of the Plan and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Employer. To
the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator, any such expense may be charged against specific Participant
Accounts, thereby reducing the obligation of the Employer. No member of the Committee, and no individual acting as the
delegate of the Committee, shall be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or
omission on his own part, excepting his own willful misconduct. The Employer will indemnify and hold harmless each
member of the Committee and any individual or individuals acting as the delegate of the Committee against any and all
expenses and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising out of his membership on the Committee (or his
serving as the delegate of the Committee), excepting only expenses and liabilities arising out of his own willful misconduct.
21
5.5 Taxes. If the whole or any part of any Participant's Account becomes liable for the payment of any estate,
inheritance, income, or other tax which the Employer may be required to pay or withhold, the Employer will have the full
power and authority to withhold and pay such tax out of any moneys or other property in its hand for the account of the
Participant. To the extent practicable, the Employer will provide the Participant notice of such withholding. Prior to making
any payment, the Employer may require such releases or other documents from any lawful taxing authority as it shall deem
necessary.
5.6 Section 16 Compliance:
(a)    General. To the maximum extent possible, this Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Act”). Accordingly, in the case of a deferral or
other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it were
approved by the Company’s Board of Directors or Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that
the Plan shall be administered by delegates of the Compensation Committee, in the case of a Participant who is subject
to Section 16 of the Act, in a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board
Approval of specific transactions to the maximum possible extent.
(b)    Approval of Distributions: From and after January 1, 2005, this Plan remains subject to the
Company’s policies requiring compliance with Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly, this Subsection shall govern the
distribution of a deferral that (i) is wholly or partly invested in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account at the time
the deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash to be distributed to a Participant, (ii) either was the
subject of a re-deferral election or was not covered by an agreement, made at the time of the Participant’s original
deferral election, that any investments in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account would, once made, remain in
that account until distribution of the deferral, (iii) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act at the
time the interest in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account would be liquidated in connection with the
distribution, and (iv) if paid at the time the distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in
a violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an opposite way transaction that would be matched with the
liquidation of the Participant’s interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account (either as a “discretionary transaction,”
within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) (a “Covered Distribution”). In the
case of a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant’s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock
Account in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the time the distribution would be
made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then provided that there is no material
modification for Section 409A purposes, the actual distribution to the Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier
of:
22
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the
liquidation of the Participant’s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account in connection with the
distribution, and
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the
Participant is no longer subject to Section 16 of the Act, when the Deferral Subaccount related to the
distribution is no longer invested in the phantom PepsiCo Capital Stock Account or when the time between the
liquidation and an opposite way transaction is sufficient.
23
ARTICLE VI
CLAIMS PROCEDURE
6.1 Claims for Benefits. If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter, "Claimant") does not receive
timely payment of any benefits which he believes are due and payable under the Plan, he may make a claim for benefits to the
Plan Administrator. The claim for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan Administrator or to the Company. If
the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant in writing within 90 days after the Plan
Administrator initially received the benefit claim. However, if special circumstances require an extension of time for
processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination of the
initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-day period. Any notice of a denial of
benefits should advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or information necessary for the
Claimant to perfect his claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to have his claim for benefits reviewed.
6.2 Appeals. Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written request for a review of
his claim by the Plan Administrator. The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he received the
written notice denying his claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be made within 60 days after receipt of a request
for review and will be communicated in writing to the Claimant. Such written notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan
Administrator's decision. If there are special circumstances which require an extension of time for completing the review, the
Plan Administrator's decision may be rendered not later than 120 days after receipt of a request for review.
6.3 Special Procedures for Disability Determinations: Notwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2, for claims and
appeals relating to Disability benefits that are filed from and after January 1, 2002, such claim or appeal shall be processed
pursuant to the applicable provisions of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 relating to Disability benefits,
including Sections 2560.503-1(d), 2560.503-1(f)(3), 2560.503-1(h)(4) and 2560.503-1(i)(3).
6.4 Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court: Before filing any Claim
(including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’s rights
under the claims procedures of this Article.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 6.4 is intended to
be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or effect this
intent may be taken).
24
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of the Plan’s
claims procedure as described in this Section 6.4, the subsequent action or consideration shall be limited, to the maximum
extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 6.4 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes that
are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to
any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii)
regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or
established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case
the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act
by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 6.4 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address
unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the
extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 6.4, the following definitions apply.
(1)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter.
(2)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –
(A)The interpretation of the Plan;
(B) The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;
(C) The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put
into effect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of
ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are,
25
in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan Administrator, or
(ii) relates to the Plan in any way.
(3)    A “Claimant” is any Employee, former Employee, Participant, former Participant, Beneficiary (or
the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual,
person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of
the foregoing, who has a Claim.
 
6.5 Limitations on Actions: Effective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1, 2019 any claim filed
under Article VI and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant,
beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity (collectively, a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan
benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within two years of the
date the Petitioner’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a
Petitioner’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received
the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the
Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of
the facts that are the basis of his claim. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged
interference with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge
of the acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within
this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner, or any representative of the Petitioner, from filing the claim or cause of
action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described in this Article shall have
no effect on this two-year time frame.
6.6 Restriction on V enue : Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or
on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 6.5 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New Y ork, ef fective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1, 2019.
26
ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
7.1 Amendments. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, or its delegate or
delegates, has the right in its sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any manner; provided,
however, that no such amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the Account of any Participant as of the date such
amendment is adopted. As of September 25, 2019, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources
Officer (or if such position is vacant or eliminated, the person who is acting to fulfill the majority of the duties of the position
(or plurality of the duties if no one is fulfilling a majority) as such duties existed immediately prior to the vacancy or the
position elimination) is delegated the responsibility to amend the Plan at any time and in any manner, except with respect to
those provisions of the Plan which relate to matters subject to Section 5.6. Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by
the Committee or an officer of the Company who is authorized by the Committee for this purpose. All Participants shall be
bound by such amendment.
7.2 Termination of Plan. The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The
Company, acting by the Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors, reserves the right to discontinue and terminate the
Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of the United
States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be binding
upon all affected Participants), but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at that time to any
Participant'’s Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), amounts theretofore credited to affected Participants'’
Accounts may either be paid in a lump sum immediately, or distributed in some other manner consistent with this Plan, as
determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion.
27
ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
8.1 Limitation on Participant's Rights. Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be
retained in the Employer's or Company'’s employ (or any right or interest in this Plan or any assets of the Company or
Employer other than as herein provided). The Company and Employer reserve the right to terminate the employment of any
Participant without any liability for any claim against the Company or Employer under this Plan, except for a claim for
payment of deferrals as provided herein.
8.2 Unfunded Obligation of Individual Employer. The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts
payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the general assets of the Participant’s individual Employer. Nothing
contained in this Plan requires the Company or Employer to set aside or hold in trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of
paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary, nor any other person shall have any property interest, legal
or equitable, in any specific Employer asset. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation on the part of a Participant’s
individual Employer, and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured creditor of this Employer with respect to
amounts of compensation deferred hereunder. Such a Participant shall not have any preference or priority over, the rights of
any other unsecured general creditor of the Employer. No other Employer guarantees or shares such obligation, and no other
Employer shall have any liability to the Participant or his Beneficiary. In the event, a Participant transfers from the
employment of one Employer to another, the former Employer shall transfer the liability for deferrals made while the
Participant was employed by that Employer to the new Employer (and the books of both Employers shall be adjusted
appropriately).
8.3 Other Plans. This Plan shall not affect the right of any eligible Employee or Participant to participate in and
receive benefits under and in accordance with the provisions of any other employee benefit plans which are now or hereafter
maintained by any Employer, unless the terms of such other employee benefit plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it
would cause such other plan to violate a requirement for tax favored treatment.
8.4 Receipt or Release. Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the
extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against the Plan Administrator, the Employer and the Company, and the Plan
Administrator may require such Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release to such
effect.
8.5 Governing Law and Compliance. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in
accordance with applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, in accordance with the laws of the
State of New
28
York. If any provisions of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully effective. In addition, at all times during each Plan Year, this Plan shall
be operated to preserve the status of deferrals under this Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to
preserve the grandfathered status of this Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of the prior sentence shall apply
notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan.
8.6 Adoption of Plan by Related Employers. The Plan Administrator may select as an Employer any division of
the Company, as well as any corporation related to the Company by stock ownership, and permit or cause such division or
corporation to adopt the Plan. The selection by the Plan Administrator shall govern the effective date of the adoption of the
Plan by such related Employer. The requirements for Plan adoption are entirely within the discretion of the Plan Administrator
and, in any case where the status of an entity as an Employer is at issue, the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be
absolutely conclusive.
8.7 Gender, Tense, Headings and Examples. In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or
plural number and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall be deemed to include the other. Headings and subheadings
in this Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not considered in the construction of the provisions hereof.
Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a
passage having a similar effect, such passage of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such
example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of application).
8.8 Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits. This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon
the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided, however, that the amounts credited to the Account of a
Participant are not (except as provided in Section 5.5) subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any
attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits
payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any assignment or alienation in connection with a separation, divorce, child
support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the Company or Employer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to make payments in accordance with a divorce
decree, judgment or other court order as and when cash payments are made in accordance with the terms of this Plan from the
subaccount of a Participant. Any such payment shall be charged against and reduce the Participant’s Account.
8.9 Facility of Payment. Whenever, in the Plan Administrator'’s opinion, a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to
receive any payment hereunder is under a legal
29
disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may direct
the Employer to make payments to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his benefit, or to apply the
payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Plan Administrator considers advisable. Any payment in
accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment to
the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan.
8.10 Separate Plans. This Plan document encompasses three separate plans of deferred compensation for all
legal purposes (including federal tax law, state tax law and, effective January 1, 1999, ERISA) as set forth in subsections (a),
(b) and (c) below.
(a) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Base Compensation and Bonus Compensation
(which shall be known as the “PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Plan”).
(b) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Performance Unit Payouts (which shall be
known as the “PepsiCo Performance Unit Deferral Plan”).
(c) The portion of the Plan that provides for deferrals of Stock Option Gains (which shall be known as
the “PepsiCo Option Gains Deferral Plan”).
Together, these three separate plans of deferred compensation, which are components of the Pre-409A Program, are referred
to, in conjunction with the 409A Program, as the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program.

This 10th day of December, 2019, the above restated Plan is hereby adopted and approved by the Company’s duly
authorized officer to be effective as stated herein.

PEPSICO EXECUTIVE INCOME DEFERRAL PROGRAM
APPENDIX
The following Appendix articles modify or supplement the general terms of the Plan as it applies to certain executives.
Except as specifically modified in the Appendix, the foregoing provisions of the Plan shall fully apply. In the event of a
conflict between this Appendix and the foregoing provisions of the Plan, the Appendix shall govern with respect to the
conflict.
A - 1
ARTICLE A
SPINOFF OF TRICON
This Article sets forth provisions that apply in connection with the Company’s spinoff of Tricon Global
Restaurants, Inc.
A.1 Definitions. When used in this Article, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth
below. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, all terms that are defined in Article II of the Plan shall have the meaning
assigned to them by Article II.
(a) Distribution Date: The “Distribution Date” as that term is defined in the 1997 Separation Agreement
between PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.
(b) PepsiCo Account Holder: A Participant who has an interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account on
the Reference Date.
(c) Reference Date: The date specified by the Plan Administrator for purposes of determining who shall
be credited with an interest in the Tricon Common Stock Account.
(d) Transferred Individual: A “Transferred Individual” as that term is defined in the 1997 Employee
Programs Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.
(e) Transition Individuals: A “Transition Individual” as that term is defined in the 1997 Employee
Programs Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.
(f) Tricon: Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc., a North Carolina Corporation.
(g) Tricon Account Holder: A PepsiCo Account Holder whose interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock
Account on the Reference Date includes at least 10 phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock.
(h) Tricon EID: Tricon Executive Income Deferral Program.
(i) Tricon Group: Tricon and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
A - 2
A.2 Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities. Effective as of the end of the day on the Distribution Date, all interests
in the Plan of (and Plan liabilities with respect to) nonterminated Transferred Individuals shall be transferred to the Tricon
EID. This transfer shall constitute a complete payout of these individuals’ Accounts for purposes of determining who is a
Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. For this purpose, a Transferred Individual shall be considered “nonterminated” if he
is actively employed by (or on a leave of absence from and expected to return to) the Tricon Group. Following the
Distribution Date, Tricon shall succeed to all of PepsiCo’s authority to affect and govern Plan interests transferred in
accordance with this section (including through interpretation, plan amendment or plan termination).
A.3 Cessation of Employer Status. Effective as of the end of the day on the Distribution Date, any Employer
who is a member of the Tricon Group shall no longer qualify as Employers hereunder. Any individual whose Account is
transferred in accordance with Section A.2 shall not thereafter be able to defer any compensation (including Stock Option
Gains) under this Plan, unless he returns to employment with an Employer following the Distribution Date (and is an eligible
Employee at the time of the deferral).
A.4 Employment Transfers by Transition Individuals. If a Participant is transferred to the Tricon Group under
circumstances that cause him to be a Transition Individual, such transfer to the Tricon Group shall not be considered a
Termination of Employment or other event that could trigger distribution of the Participant’s interest in the Plan. In this case,
the Participant’s interest in the Plan (and all Plan liabilities with respect to the Participant) shall be retained by the Plan. For
purposes of determining the distribution of such Participant’s interest in the Plan, the Participant’s Termination of
Employment shall not be deemed to occur before his termination of employment with the Tricon Group.
A.5 Special Tricon Stock Investment Option. As of the Distribution Date, the Plan Administrator shall establish
a temporary phantom investment option under the Plan, the Tricon Common Stock Account, and each Tricon Account Holder
shall be credited with an interest in such account.
(a) Establishing the Account Holder’s Interest. The amount of a Tricon Account Holder’s interest is
determined by dividing by 10 the number of phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock standing to his credit in the
PepsiCo Capital Stock Account on the Reference Date. The portion of the resulting quotient that is an integer shall be
the number of phantom shares of Tricon Common Stock that is credited to the Participant’s Tricon Common
A - 3
Stock Account as of the Distribution Date. A Tricon Stock Holder’s interest in the Tricon Common Stock Account
shall also include a dividend subaccount. The initial balance in the dividend subaccount shall be zero, but it shall
thereafter be credited with all amounts that would be received for the Participant by the Tricon Common Stock
Account as dividends, if dividends were paid on phantom shares of Tricon Common Stock as they are on actual shares.
All amounts credited to this dividend subaccount shall be invested in the phantom option described in Section 4.1(c)(1)
(the Interest Bearing Account).
(b) Valuation and Adjustment: A Participant’s interest in the Tricon Common Stock Account is valued as
of a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom shares credited to his Account on such date by the fair
market value of a share of Tricon Common Stock on such date, and then adding the value of the Participant’s dividend
subaccount.
(1) As of any date, the fair market value of Tricon Common Stock is determined for purposes of
this Article using procedures comparable to those used in determining the Fair Market Value of PepsiCo Capital
Stock, but with such modifications as the Plan Administrator may apply from time to time.
(2) If shares of Tricon Common Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spinoff, combination or exchange of shares or other any other
corporate change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator, such equitable adjustment shall
be made in the number of shares credited to an Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine
to be necessary or appropriate
In no event will shares of Tricon Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no Participant shall
have any rights as a shareholder of Tricon Common Stock on account of an interest in the Tricon Common Stock
Account.
(c) Investment Reallocations. In accordance with Section 4.1(e), a Tricon Account Holder may reallocate
amounts from his Subaccounts in the Tricon Common Stock Account to other phantom investment options under the
Plan that are available for this purpose. No Participant may reallocate amounts into the Tricon Common Stock
Account.
A - 4
(d) Termination of the Tricon Common Stock Account. Effective as of the end of the day on December
31, 1999 (or such later date as the Plan Administrator shall specify), the Tricon Common Stock Account shall cease to
be available under the Plan. Any amount under the Plan still standing to the credit of a Participant on such date shall
automatically be reallocated to the phantom investment option described in Section 4.1(c)(1) (the Interest Bearing
Account) unless the Participant selects a different replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan
Administrator may apply.
A.6 PepsiCo Account Holders with Less Than 10 Shares: The interest in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account of
any PepsiCo Account Holder who does not qualify to be a Tricon Account Holder shall be adjusted as of the Distribution
Date. Pursuant to this adjustment, the value of his dividend subaccount under the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account shall be
increased by the product of (a) and (b) below:
(a) The number of phantom shares of PepsiCo stock credited to the Participant’s Account under the
PepsiCo Capital Stock Account divided by 10.
(b) The fair market value of a share of Tricon Common Stock on the Distribution Date.

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PBG
This Article sets forth provisions that apply in connection with PBG’s initial public offering.
B.1 Definitions. When used in this Article, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth
below. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, all terms that are defined in Article II of the Plan shall have the meaning
assigned to them by Article II.
(a) Offering Date: The “Offering Date” as that term is defined in the Separation Agreement between
PepsiCo, Inc. and PBG.
(b) PBG: Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc.
(c) PBG EID: PBG Executive Income Deferral Program.
(d) PBG Group: PBG and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
(e) Transferred Individual: A “Transferred Individual” as that term is defined in the Employee Programs
Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and PBG.
(f) Transition Individuals: A “Transition Individual” as that term is defined in the Employee Programs
Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc. and PBG.
B.2 Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities. Effective as of the end of the day on the Offering Date, all interests in
the Plan of (and Plan liabilities with respect to) nonterminated Transferred Individuals shall be transferred to the PBG EID.
This transfer shall constitute a complete payout of these individuals’ Accounts for purposes of determining who is a
Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. For this purpose, a Transferred Individual shall be considered “nonterminated” if he
is actively employed by (or on a leave of absence from and expected to return to) the PBG Group, as of the end of the day on
the Offering Date.
B.3 Cessation of Employer Status. Effective as of the end of the day on the Offering Date, any Employer who is
a member of the PBG Group shall no
B - 1
longer qualify as an Employer hereunder. Any individual whose Account is transferred in accordance with Section B.2 shall
not thereafter be able to defer any compensation (including Stock Option Gains) under this Plan, unless he returns to
employment with an Employer following the Offering Date (and is an eligible Employee at the time of the deferral).
Following the Offering Date, PBG shall succeed to all of PepsiCo’s authority to affect and govern Plan interests transferred in
accordance with this section (including through interpretation, plan amendment or plan termination).
B.4 Employment Transfers by Transition Individuals.
(a) Transfers to PBG. If a Participant is transferred to the PBG Group under circumstances that cause
him to be a Transition Individual, such transfer to the PBG Group shall not be considered a Termination of
Employment or other event that could trigger distribution of the Participant’s interest in the Plan. In this case, the
Participant’s interest in the Plan (and all Plan liabilities with respect to the Participant) may be retained by the Plan, or
they may be transferred to the PBG EID, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its discretion. If a transfer of the
Participant’s interest occurs, this transfer shall constitute a complete payout of the Participant’s Account for purposes
of determining who is a Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. If a transfer does not occur, for purposes of
determining the distribution of such Participant’s interest in the Plan, the Participant’s Termination of Employment
shall not be deemed to occur before his termination of employment with the PBG Group.
(b) Transfers from PBG. If an individual is transferred by the PBG Group to an Employer under
circumstances that cause him to be a Transition Individual and such individual’s interest in the PBG EID is transferred
to this Plan, such Individual shall become a Participant in this Plan. In connection with any such transfer of the
individual’s interest, the individual’s phantom investment in PBG capital stock under the PBG EID shall be carried
over and replicated hereunder until December 31, 2000 (or such other date as may be specified by the Plan
Administrator). Any other phantom investment of the individual under the PBG EID may be carried over and
replicated hereunder, or it may be converted to a phantom investment available under the Plan (depending upon the
procedures then applied by the Plan Administrator).
B.5 Special PBG Stock Investment Option. To the extent required by Section B.4 (and as otherwise made
available by the Plan Administrator from time to
B - 2
time), the Plan Administrator shall establish a temporary phantom investment option under the Plan, the PBG Capital Stock
Account.
(a) General Principles. The PBG Capital Stock Account shall be administered under rules that are similar
to those applicable to the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account, but with such modifications as the Plan Administrator may
apply from time to time.
(b) Valuation and Adjustment: A Participant’s interest in the PBG Capital Stock Account is valued as of
a Valuation Date by multiplying the number of phantom shares credited to his Account on such date by the fair market
value of a share of PBG Capital Stock on such date, and then adding the value of the Participant’s dividend subaccount.
If shares of PBG Capital Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation, spinoff, combination or exchange of shares or other any other corporate change treated as subject to this
provision by the Plan Administrator, such equitable adjustment shall be made in the number of shares credited to an
Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be necessary or appropriate. In no event will shares
of PBG Capital Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no Participant shall have any rights as a
shareholder of PBG Capital Stock on account of an interest in the PBG Capital Stock Account.
(c) Investment Reallocations. In accordance with Section 4.1(e), a PBG Account Holder may reallocate
amounts from his Subaccounts in the PBG Capital Stock Account to other phantom investment options under the Plan
that are available for this purpose. Except as expressly authorized by the Plan Administrator, no Participant may
reallocate amounts into the PBG Capital Stock Account.
(d) Termination of the PBG Capital Stock Account. Effective as of the end of the day on December 31,
2000 (or such later date as the Plan Administrator shall specify), the PBG Capital Stock Account shall cease to be
available under the Plan. Any amount under the Plan still standing to the credit of a Participant on such date shall
automatically be reallocated to the phantom investment option described in Section 4.1(c)(1) (the Interest Bearing
Account) unless the Participant selects a different replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan
Administrator may apply.
