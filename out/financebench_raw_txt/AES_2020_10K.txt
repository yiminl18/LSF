Executive Summary  
Incorporated in 1981, AES is a global energy company accelerat ing the future of energy. Together with our 
many stakeholders, we are improving lives by delivering the greener, smarter energy solutions the world needs. Our 
diverse workforce is committed to continuous innovation and operational excellence, while partnering with our 
customers on their strategic energy transitions and continuing to meet their energy needs today. 
Our Strategy
AES is leading the energy transition by investing in sustainable growth and innovative solutions to deliver 
superior results. We are taking advantage  of favorable trends in clean power generation, transmission and 
distribution, and LNG infrastructure.
Through our presence in key growth markets, we are well-positioned to benefit from the global transition 
toward a more sustainable power generation mix. Our robust backlog of projects under construction or under signed 
PPAs continues to increase, driven by our focus on select markets where we can take advantage of our global scale 
and synergies with our existing businesses. In 2020, we signed long-term PPAs for 3 GW, representing 10% of our 
existing capacity, and in line with our expectation of signing 2 to 3 GW of new PPAs annually. 
We are enhancing some of our current contracts by extending existing PPAs and adding renewable energy. 
We call this approach Green Blend and Extend. With this strategy, we leverage our existing platforms, contracts and 
relationships to grow our business, while meeting our customers' energy needs on a reliable and sustainable basis. 
We are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing customers, which preserves the value of thermal 
contracts and creates incremental value with long-term contracted renewables. Customers receive carbon-free 
energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and 
affordable energy needs. We are executing on this strategy in Chile and Mexico and see significant potential 
additional opportunities in those markets, as well as in the United States.
We recently merged all of our renewables businesses  in the U.S. into one team: AES Clean Energy, 
representing one of the top renewables growth platforms in the U.S. AES Clean Energy offers its customers an 
expanded portfolio of innovative solutions based on cutting-edge technologies that are designed to accelerate their 
energy futures.
We are facilitating access to reliable and affordable cleaner energy through our LNG import terminals, allowing 5 | 2020 Annual Report
the displacement of the use of heavy fuel oil and diesel. We have two LNG regasification terminals in Central 
America and the Caribbean, with a total of 150 TBTU of LNG storage capacity. These terminals were built to supply 
not only the gas for our co-located combined cycle plants, but also to meet the growing demand for natural gas in 
the region. In order to meet this demand, we are expanding our capacity in the Dominican Republic by adding a 
second storage tank with 50 TBTU of additional capacity and we recently completed construction of a pipeline that 
will transport natural gas from our LNG terminal to several power plants in the country.
We are replicating our success with LNG infrastructure in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing 
a similar project, on a larger scale, in Vietnam. This project will have 480 TBTU of LNG storage capacity co-located 
with 2.2 GW of combined cycle plants. The project will have substantial excess LNG capacity to help meet demand 
for natural gas in Vietnam and the power plants will have 20-year contracts with the Government of Vietnam.
At our utilities, we are accelerating growth through grid modernization and infrastructure investments to replace 
outdated networks. In 2020 , Indianapolis Power & Light 's seven-year $1.2 billion TDSIC plan was approved by the 
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.  We see similar growth opportunities at Dayton Power & Light in Ohio, 
including DP&L's pending Smart Grid Plan.
We are developing and deploying innovative solutions such as battery-based energy storage, digital customer 
interfaces and energy management. These solutions are scalable and capital light, allowing us to work with our 
customers to deliver results that meet their requirements.
As a result of executing on our strategy, we have reduced our coal-fired generation to 25% of our total 
generation volume as of year-end 2020 (based on the portfolio as of year-end , adjusted for any announced asset 
sales and retirements at that time). We remain on track to further reduce our coal generation to below 10% by year-
end 2030.

Overview  
Generation
We currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 30,308  MW, including generation from our integrated 
utility, IPL. Our generation fleet is diversified by fuel type. See discussion below under Fuel Costs .
Performance drivers of our generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability 
and flexibility, availability of generation capacity to meet contracted sales, fuel costs, seasonality, weather variations 
and economic activity, fixed-cost management, and competition.
Contract Sales — Most of our generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts 
("contract sales") or under short-term agreements in competitive markets ("short-term sales"). Our medium-term 
contract sales have terms of two to five years, while our long-term contracts have terms of more than five years. 
Contracts requiring fuel to generate energy, such as natural gas or coal, are structured to recover variable 
costs, including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or 
tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter 
into fuel supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion below under Fuel Costs ). These contracts 
also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse 
project-level financing.
Certain contracts include capacity payments that cover projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M 
expenses, debt service, and a return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority 
of the capacity payments be denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs. 
Contracts that do not have significant fuel cost or do not contain a capacity payment are structured based on 
long-term spot prices with some negotiated pass-through costs, allowing us to recover expected fixed and variable 
costs as well as provide a return on investment. 
These contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel and electricity prices by linking the 
business's revenues and costs. We generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by 
matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including fixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of 
both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically hedge a significant portion of our exposure. Some of our 
contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail 
in the Short-Term Sales  section below.
Thus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to 
changes in power and, as applicable, fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, 
these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as 
long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract.
Short-Term Sales — Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term 
contracts with average terms of less than two years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at 
regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. 
Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive generation facilities, based 
upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-
term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet 
system demand). As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to 
fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for 
ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we provide a 
wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves. 
Many of the short-term markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity 
markets are intended to provide additional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin 
from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the 
system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peak demand). 7 | 2020 Annual Report
Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their 
availability in the market. 
Plant Reliability and Flexibility — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants 
to optimally manage availability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are 
frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to 
capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to capture 
ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs.
Fuel Costs — For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. 
For contract sales, we often enter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may financially 
hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts include indexation for fuels. In those cases, we seek to match our fuel 
supply agreements to the indexation. For certain projects, we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is 
responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.
In short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the 
time, and thus procure fuel supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales 
profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for power prices, the economics of projects with short-term 
sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding commodity price risk 
please see Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in this Form 10-K.
37% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by renewables, including hydro, solar, wind, energy 
storage, biomass and landfill gas, which do not have significant fuel costs.
33% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by natural gas. Generally, we use gas from local 
suppliers in each market. A few exceptions to this are AES Gener in Chile, where we purchase imported gas from 
third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic and Panama, where we import LNG to utilize in the local 
market.
27% of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our coal-fired plants are supplied 
from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants, and at our plants in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, we source coal 
internationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel 
procurement.
3% of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes pet coke, diesel or oil for fuel. We source oil and diesel locally 
at prices linked to international markets. We largely source pet coke from Mexico and the U.S. 
Seasonality, Weather Variations and Economic Activity — Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal 
weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather 
variations, including temperature, solar and wind resources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact 
on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive markets for power, local economic activity 
can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.
Fixed-Cost Management — In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are 
recovered through the capacity payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and 
reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.
Competition — For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the 
term of the contract. For short-term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market 
competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.
Utilities
AES' six utility businesses distribute power to 2.5 million  people in two countries. AES' two utilities in the U.S. 
also include generation capacity totaling 3,973  MW. Our utility businesses consist of IPL and DP&L in the U.S. and 
four utilities in El Salvador.
 IPL, our fully integrated utility, and DP&L, our transmission and distribution regulated utility, operate as the 
sole distributors of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. IPL owns and operates all of the facilities 
necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. DP&L owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to 
transmit and distribute electricity. At our distribution business in El Salvador, we face limited competition due to 
significant barriers to enter the market. According to El Salvador's regulation, large regulated customers have the 
option of becoming unregulated users and requesting service directly from generation or commercialization agents.8 | 2020 Annual Report
In general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers 
directly. Key performance drivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather 
variations, economic activity and reliability of service. Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated on the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Regulated Rate of Return and Tariff — In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service 
territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the 
prices ("tariffs") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity and establishes service standards 
that we are required to meet.
Our utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator 
based on the utility's allowed regulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which 
the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator, within the framework of applicable local laws, and is 
based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return 
and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and operating 
expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to 
its customers.
The tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the 
utility may seek a change in its tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level and may include a pass-
through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/
or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the 
customer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In 
some regulatory regimes, customers with demand above an established level are unregulated and can choose to 
contract directly with the utility or with other retail energy suppliers and pay non-bypassable fees, which are fees to 
the distribution company for use of its distribution system.
The regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed 
costs, as well as manage uncollectible amounts, quality of service and technical and non-technical losses. Utilities, 
therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished 
returns.
Seasonality, Weather Variations, and Economic Activity — Our utility businesses are generally affected by 
seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. 
Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on the number of customers, temperature variances 
from normal conditions, and customers' historic usage levels and patterns. Retail sales, after adjustments for 
weather variations, are also affected by changes in local economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed 
generation initiatives, as well as the number of retail customers.
Reliability of Service — Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration and 
frequency of outages. Those standards may be explicit, with defined performance incentives or penalties, or implicit, 
where the utility must operate to meet customer and/or regulator expectations.
Development and Construction  
We develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility business, new plants may be built or existing 
plants retrofitted in response to customer needs or to comply with regulatory developments. The projects are 
developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. 
For our generation businesses, our priority for development is in key growth markets, where we can leverage our 
global scale and synergies with our existing businesses by adding renewable energy. We make the decision to 
invest in new projects by evaluating the strategic fit, project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted 
return for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment. 
In some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing 
construction. To limit required equity contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project 
debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners, when it is commercially attractive. We typically 
contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team supervises the 
construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget and the required safety, efficiency and 
productivity standards.9 | 2020 Annual Report
Segments
The segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to 
reflect how the Company manages the business internally. It is organized by geographic regions, which provides a 
socio-political-economic understanding of our business. 
We are organized into four market-oriented SBUs: US and Utilities  (United States, Puerto Rico and El 
Salvador); South America  (Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil); MCAC  (Mexico, Central America and the 
Caribbean); and Eurasia (Europe and Asia)  — which are led by our SBU Presidents. We have two lines of 
business: generation and utilities. Each of our SBUs participates in our first business line, generation, in which we 
own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and 
other intermediaries. Our US and Utilities SBU participates in our second business line, utilities, in which we own 
and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the 
residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, 
our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market.
We measure the operating performance of our SBUs using Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure. The Adjusted 
PTC by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2020  is shown below. The percentages for Adjusted PTC are the 
contribution by each SBU to the gross metric, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC by SBU, before deductions for Corporate.

US and Utilities Businesses
IPL
Business Description — IPALCO is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is IPL. IPL, which also does 
business as AES Indiana, is an integrated utility that is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing, 
and selling electric energy to retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of 
Indiana and is subject to regulatory authority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. IPL has an 
exclusive right to provide electric service to the customers in its service area, covering about 528 square miles with 
an estimated population of approximately 965,000 people. IPL owns and operates four generating stations, all within 
the state of Indiana. IPL’s largest generating station, Petersburg, is coal-fired, and  IPL has plans  to retire 
approximately 630 MW of coal-fired generation at Petersburg Units 1 and 2 in 2021 and 2023 , respectively (see 
Integrated Resource Plan below). The second largest station, Harding Street, uses natural gas and fuel oil to power 
combustion turbines. In addition, IPL operates a 20 MW battery-based energy storage unit at Harding Street, which 
provides frequency response. The third station, Eagle Valley, is a CCGT natural gas plant. IPL took operational 
control and commenced commercial operations of this CCGT in April 2018. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a 
small peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines. In addition, IPL helps meet its customers' 
energy needs with long-term contracts for the purchase of 96 MW of solar-generated electricity and 300 MW of 
wind-generated electricity.
Key Financial Drivers — IPL's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and 
maintenance costs. IPL's financial results are likely to be driven by many other factors as well, including, but not 
limited to:
•regulatory outcomes and impacts;14 | 2020 Annual Report
•the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulation; and
•timely recovery of capital expenditures.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — IPL is subject to comprehensive regulation by the IURC with 
respect to its services and facilities, retail rates and charges, the issuance of long-term securities, and certain other 
matters. The regulatory authority of the IURC over IPL's business is typical of regulation generally imposed by state 
public utility commissions. The IURC sets tariff rates for electric service provided by IPL. The IURC considers all 
allowable costs for ratemaking purposes, including a fair return on assets used and useful to providing service to 
customers.
IPL's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and approved charges. In 
addition, IPL's rates include various adjustment mechanisms, including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect 
changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet IPL's retail load requirements, referred to as the Fuel 
Adjustment Charge, (ii) a rider to reflect changes in ongoing RTO costs, and (iii) a rider for the timely recovery of 
demand side management energy efficiency program costs, and (iv) riders to collect changes in capacity sales and 
wholesale sales margins above and below established annual benchmarks, referred to as the Capacity Adjustment 
and Off-System Sales Margin Adjustment, respectively. These components function somewhat independently of one 
another, but the overall structure of IPL's rates is subject to review at the time of any review of IPL's basic rates and 
charges. Additionally, IPL's rider recoveries are reviewed through recurring filings.
On October 31, 2018, the IURC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement agreement to increase 
IPL's annual revenues by $44 million, or 3% (the "2018 Base Rate Order"). This revenue increase primarily includes 
recovery through rates of costs associated with the CCGT at Eagle Valley, completed in the first half of 2018, and 
other construction projects. New base rates and charges became effective on December 5, 2018. The 2018 Base 
Rate Order also provides customers with approximately $50 million in benefits over a two-year period through a rate 
adjustment mechanism that began in March 2019.
IPL is one of many transmission system owner members in MISO, an RTO which maintains functional control 
over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary 
services markets in the U.S. MISO dispatches generation assets in economic order considering transmission 
constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region. IPL offers electricity in the 
MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. 
Development Strategy — IPL's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for 
prudent utility operations and compliance with environmental regulations, along with discretionary investments 
designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall performance. 
Senate Enrolled Act 560, the  Transmission, Distribution, and Storage System Improvement Charge  ("TDSIC") 
statute, provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for new or replacement electric and 
gas transmission, distribution, and storage projects that a public utility undertakes for the purposes of safety, 
reliability, system modernization, or economic development. Provisions of  the TDSIC statute require that requests 
for recovery include a seven-year plan of eligible investments. Once a plan is approved by the IURC, eighty percent 
of eligible costs can be recovered using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, referred to as a TDSIC mechanism. 
Recoverable costs include a return on, and of, the investment, including AFUDC, post-in-service carrying charges, 
operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and property taxes. The remaining twenty percent of 
recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in the public utility’s next general rate case. The TDSIC 
mechanism is capped at an annual increase of two percent of total retail revenues.
On March 4, 2020, the IURC issued an order approving the projects in IPL's seven-year TDSIC Plan for 
eligible transmission, distribution, and storage system improvements totaling $1.2 billion from 2020 through 2027. 
On June 18, 2020, IPL filed its first annual TDSIC rate adjustment for a return on, and of, investments through 
March 31, 2020. On October 14, 2020, the IURC issued an order approving this TDSIC rate adjustment, which was 
reflected in rates effective November 2020.
Integrated Resource Plan — In December 2019, IPL filed its Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP"), which 
describes IPL's Preferred Resource Portfolio for meeting its generation capacity needs for serving its retail 
customers over the next several years. IPL's Preferred Resource Portfolio is IPL's reasonable least cost option and 
provides a cleaner and more diverse generation mix for customers. The IRP includes the retirement of 630 MW of 
coal-fired generation by 2023. Based on extensive modeling, IPL has determined that the cost of operating 
Petersburg Units 1 and 2 exceeds the value customers receive compared to alternative resources. Retirement of 
these units allows the company to cost-effectively diversify the portfolio and tra nsition to lower cost and cleaner 
resources while maintaining a reliable system.15 | 2020 Annual Report
IPL issued an all-source Request for Proposal on December 20, 2019, in order to competitively procure 
replacement capacity by June 1, 2023, which is the first year IPL is expected to have a capacity shortfall. Modeling 
indicated that a combination of wind, solar, storage, and energy efficiency would be the lowest reasonable cost 
option for the replacement capacity. Proposals were received through February 28, 2020 and are currently being 
evaluated.  On Febru ary 5, 2021, IPL announced an agreement to acquire a 195 MW solar project, subject to 
approval from the IURC.
DPL 
Business Description — DPL is an energy holding company whose principal subsidiary is DP&L. DP&L, which 
also does business as AES Ohio, is a utility company that transmits and distributes electricity to retail customers in a 
6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio and is subject to regulatory authority—see Regulatory Framework and 
Market Structure below. DP&L has the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services to its 
customers, and procures retail standard service offer  ("SSO")  electric service on behalf of residential, commercial, 
industrial, and governmental customers through a competitive bid auction process. In previous years, AES Ohio 
Generation was also a primary subsidiary, but DPL has systematically exited this generation business. AES Ohio 
Generation completed the sale of its peaker assets in March 2018. In May 2018, AES Ohio Generation retired its 
Stuart and Killen facilities and completed the transfer of these facilities to a third party in December 2019. AES Ohio 
Generation's only remaining operating asset, Conesville Unit 4, was shut down in May 2020 and sold in June 2020.
Key Financial Drivers — Following the removal of the Decoupling Rider in December 2019, DPL's financial 
results are driven primarily by retail demand and weather. DPL's financial results are likely to be driven by other 
factors as well, including, but not limited to:
•regulatory outcomes and impacts;
•the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations, or other changes in regulations; and
•timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — DP&L is regulated by the PUCO for its distribution services 
and facilities, retail rates and charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio 
requirements, energy efficiency program requirements, and certain other matters. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction 
over the delivery of electricity, SSO, and other retail electric services. 
Electric customers within Ohio are permitted to purchase power under contract from a Competitive Retail 
Electric Service (" CRES ") provider or from their local utility under SSO rates. The SSO generation supply is 
provided by third parties through a competitive bid process. Ohio utilities have the exclusive right to provide 
transmission and distribution services in their state-certified territories. While Ohio allows customers to choose retail 
generation providers, DP&L is required to provide retail generation service at SSO rates to any customer that has 
not signed a contract with a CRES provider or as a provider of last resort in the event of a CRES provider default. 
SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and are established through a competitive bid process 
for the supply of power to SSO customers. 
DP&L's distribution rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based 
rate-setting process. DP&L is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a 
regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, 
capital structure, and cost of capital. DP&L's retail rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not 
limited to, the timely recovery of costs incurred related to power purchased through the competitive bid process, 
participation in the PJM RTO, severe  storm damage, and energy efficiency. DP&L's  transmission rates are regulated 
by FERC.
DP&L is a member of PJM, an RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all 
or parts of a multi-state region, including Ohio. PJM also administers the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, 
ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members.
In September 2018, DP&L received an order from the PUCO establishing new base distribution rates, which 
became effective October 1, 2018. The order approved, without modification, a stipulation and recommendation 
previously filed by DP&L, along with various intervening parties, with the PUCO staff. The order established a 
revenue requirement of $248 million for DP&L's electric service base distribution rates, which reflected an increase 
to distribution revenues of $30 million per year. In addition, the order authorized DP&L to collect from customers 
costs related to qualified investments through a Distribution Investment Rider ("DIR"), changed the Decoupling 
Rider to reduce variability from the impact of weather and demand, partially resolved regulatory issues related to the 
TCJA, and authorized DP&L to defer certain vegetation management costs for future collection.16 | 2020 Annual Report
On November 30, 2020, DP&L filed a new Distribution Rate Case Application proposing a revenue increase of 
$121 million per year and incorporates DIR investments that were planned and approved in the last rate case but 
not yet included in distribution rates, other distribution investments since September 2015, investments necessitated 
by the tornados that occurred on Memorial Day in 2019, and other proposed increases. The outcome of this filing is 
unknown at this time.
In March 2020, DP&L filed an application for a formula-based rate for its transmission service, which was 
approved and made effective May 3, 2020. In December 2020, a unanimous settlement was reached regarding 
these rates and filed with the FERC, which would be an approximately $7 million  annualized increase from the rates 
in effect prior to May 3, 2020. The uncontested settlement is expected to receive FERC approval in early 2021.
ESP Proceedings  — Ohio law requires utilities to provide their customers a default generation service, known 
as an SSO, which can be in the form of an electric security plan ( "ESP") or a market rate offer ("MRO"), submitted 
for approval to the PUCO. The PUCO previously approved DP&L’s ESP for a six-year period beginning on 
November 1, 2017 (“ESP 3”). ESP 3 established a Distribution Modernization Rider (“DMR”)  with an initial three-
year term to collect $105 million in revenue per year through October 2020 primarily to pay debt obligations at DPL 
and DP&L and position DP&L to modernize and/or maintain its transmission and distribution infrastructure.
In November 2019, the PUCO issued an order modifying the ESP 3 by removing the DMR. As a result, DP&L 
requested and the PUCO approved the request to revert to the ESP 1 rates, including authorizing the collection of a 
Rate Stability Charge ("RSC") of approximately $79 million per year, effective December 18, 2019. The order also 
disallowed the Regulatory Compliance Rider, Uncollectible Rider, DIR, and the Decoupling Rider. The PUCO order 
also required DP&L to conduct both an ESP v. MRO Test to validate that the ESP is more favorable in the aggregate 
than what would be experienced under an MRO, and a prospective SEET, both of which were filed with the PUCO 
on April 1, 2020. DP&L is also subject to an annual retrospective SEET. On October 23, 2020, DP&L entered into a 
Stipulation and Recommendation with the staff of the PUCO and certain other parties with respect to, among other 
matters, DP&L’s applications pending at the PUCO for (i) approval of DP&L’s plan to modernize its distribution grid 
(the “Smart Grid Plan”), (ii) findings that DP&L passed the SEET for 2018 and 2019, and (iii) findings that DP&L’s 
current electric security plan, ESP 1, satisfies the SEET and the more favorable in the aggregate (“MFA”) regulatory 
test. The settlement is subject to, and conditioned upon, approval by the PUCO. A hearing was conducted January 
11 - 15, 2021 for consideration of this settlement. The settlement would provide, among other items, for the 
following:
•Approval of the Smart Grid Plan outlined in the Smart Grid Plan application filed by DP&L with the PUCO, 
as modified by the terms of the settlement, including, subject to offsetting operational benefits and certain 
other conditions, a return on and recovery of up to $249 million of Smart Grid Plan Phase 1 capital 
investments and recovery of operational and maintenance expenses through DP&L’s existing Infrastructure 
Investment Rider for a term of four years, under an aggregate cap of approximately $268 million on the 
amount of such investments and expenses that is recoverable, and an acknowledgement that DP&L may 
file a subsequent application with the PUCO within three years seeking approvals for Phase 2 of the Smart 
Grid Plan;
•A commitment by DP&L to invest in a Customer Information System and supporting technologies during 
Phase 1 of the Smart Grid Plan, with return on and of prudently incurred capital investments and 
operational and maintenance expenses, including deferred operational and maintenance expense amounts, 
in a future rate case;
•A determination that ESP 1 satisfies the prospective SEET and the MFA regulatory test;
•A recommendation by parties to the settlement that the PUCO also finds that DP&L satisfies the 
retrospective SEET for 2018 and 2019;
•A commitment to file an application with the PUCO no later than October 1, 2023 for a new ESP that does 
not seek to implement certain non-bypassable charges, including those related to provider of last resort 
risks, stability, or financial integrity;
•DP&L shareholder funding, in an aggregate amount of approximately $30 million over four years, for certain 
economic development discounts, incentives, and grants to certain commercial and industrial customers, 
including hospitals and manufacturers, assistance for low-income customers as well as the residents and 
businesses of the City of Dayton, and promotion of solar and resiliency development within DP&L’s service 
territory.
Certain parties which intervened in the ESP proceedings have filed petitions for rehearing of the recent PUCO 
ESP order, some of which seek to eliminate DP&L's RSC from its rates and others to re-implement ESP 3 without 17 | 2020 Annual Report
the DMR. The ultimate outcome of these petitions is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on DP&L’s 
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The parties signing the above-referenced settlement  have 
agreed to withdraw their respective petitions if the settlement is approved by the PUCO without material 
modification.
Separate from the ESP process, on January 23, 2020, DP&L filed with the PUCO requesting approval to defer 
its decoupling costs consistent with the methodology approved in its Distribution Rate Case. If approved, deferral 
would be effective December 18, 2019 and going forward would reduce impacts of weather, energy efficiency 
programs, and economic changes in customer demand .
Development Strategy — Planned construction projects primarily relate to new investments in and upgrades to 
DP&L's transmission and distribution system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in 
light of changes in financial and economic conditions, load forecasts, legislative and regulatory developments, and 
changing environmental standards, among other factors.
DPL is projecting to spend an estimated $767 million on capital projects from 2021 through 2023, which 
includes expected spending under DP&L's Smart Grid Plan included in the Stipulation and Recommendation 
entered into on October 23, 2020 (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  above) as well as new 
transmission projects. The Smart Grid Plan was initially filed with the PUCO in December 2018 proposing to invest 
$576 million in capital projects over 10 years and includes leveraging technologies to modernize and improve the 
sustainability of the grid, and enhancing customer experience and security, as well as to allow DP&L to leverage 
and integrate distributed energy resources into its grid, including community solar, energy storage, microgrids, and 
electric vehicle charging infrastructure. DPL expects to finance this construction with a combination of cash on hand, 
short-term financing, long-term debt, equity capital contributions, and cash flows from operations.
Non-renewable U.S. Generation 
Business Description — In the U.S., we own a diversified generation portfolio. The principal markets and 
locations where we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the California 
Independent System Operator ("CAISO"), PJM,  Hawaii, and Puerto Rico . AES Southland, operating in the CAISO, 
is our most significant generation business. 
Many of our non-renewable U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a 
guaranteed level of availability. Any change in availability has a direct impact on financial performance. Some plants 
are eligible for availability bonuses if they meet certain requirements. Coal and natural gas are used as the primary 
fuels. Coal prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas prices are generally set domestically. 
Price variations for these fuels can change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation 
businesses. 
Many of these generation businesses have entered into long-term PPAs with utilities or other offtakers. Some 
businesses with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment 
partially based on the market price of fuel. When market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker, revenue 
may change as fuel prices fluctuate, but the variable margin or profitability should remain consistent. These 
businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decrease profitability from payments under their PPAs 
depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, ability to buy coal at lower costs through AES' 
global sourcing program, and fuel flexibility.
Warrior Run is one of our non-renewable generation businesses in the U.S. that currently operate as a QF, as 
defined under the PURPA. This business entered into  a long-term contract with an electric utility that had a 
mandatory obligation to purchase power from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e. the likely costs for both energy 
and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own 
generating capacity or purchase it from another source). To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity 
and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling application in certain 
proportions to the facility's total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power 
production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria or be a 
cogeneration facility that simultaneously generates electricity and processes heat or steam.
Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators as defined 
under the EPAct of 1992, amending the Public Utility Holding Company Act (“PUHCA”). These businesses, subject 
to approval of FERC, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to 
a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the FPA and FERC's regulations, 
approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to 18 | 2020 Annual Report
FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect 
other barriers to market entry, and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates 
of the seller. 
The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both 
federal regulation, as implemented by FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and 
implemented by the RTOs, non-profit corporations that operate the regional transmission grid and maintain 
organized markets for electricity. These rules, for the most part, govern such items as the determination of the 
market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and 
incentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors  for additional discussion on U.S. regulatory 
matters.
AES Southland
Business Description — AES Southland is one of the largest generation operators in California by aggregate 
installed capacity, with an installed gross capacity of 3,611 MW at the end of 2020. The five coastal power plants 
comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an important role in integrating 
the increasing amounts of renewable generation resources in California. AES Southland is composed of three once-
through cooling ("OTC") power plants, two combined cycle gas-fired generation facilities and an interconnected 
battery-based energy storage facility .
AES Huntington Beach, LLC, AES Alamitos, LLC, and AES Redondo Beach ("Southland OTC units") are 
contracted through Resource Adequacy Purchase Agreements (“RAPAs”). Under the RAPAs, as approved by the 
California Public Utilities Commission, these generating stations provide resource adequacy capacity, and have no 
obligation to produce or sell any energy to the RAPA counterparty. However, the generating stations are required to 
bid energy into the California ISO markets. Compensation under these RAPAs is dependent on the availability of the 
AES Southland units in the California ISO market. Failure to achieve the minimum availability target would result in 
an assessed penalty.
 In November 2014, AES Southland was awarded 20-year contracts by Southern California Edison ("SCE") to 
provide 1,284 MW of combined cycle gas-fired generation and 100 MW of interconnected battery-based energy 
storage ("Southland Energy units"). The agreements for the combined cycle gas-fired generation were amended in 
2019 and capacity was increased to 1,299 MW. The contracts are RAPAs with annual energy put options. If AES 
Southland exercises the annual put option, all capacity, energy and ancillary services will be sold to SCE in 
exchange for a fixed monthly fee that covers fixed operating cost, debt service, and return on capital. In addition, 
SCE will reimburse variable costs and provide the natural gas.
In April 2017, the California Energy Commission unanimously approved the licenses for the Southland Energy 
combined cycle projects at AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach. In June 2017, AES closed the financing of $2 
billion, funded with a combination of non-recourse debt and AES equity. Construction of the combined cycle 
capacity began in 2017.
At the end of 2019, five of the twelve Southland OTC generation units were retired to support the construction 
efforts of the Southland Energy combined cycle gas-fired generation projects in anticipation of COD, which was 
reached in early February 2020. On January 23, 2020, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake 
Structures adopted a recommendation to present to the California State Water Resources Board ("SWRCB") to 
extend OTC compliance dates for the remaining Southland OTC units at AES Huntington Beach and AES Alamitos 
until December 31, 2023 and AES Redondo Beach until December 31, 2021. On September 1, 2020, in response to 
a request by the state's energy, utility, and grid operators and regulators, the SWRCB approved amendments to its 
OTC. The SWRCB OTC Policy previously required the shutdown and permanent retirement of all remaining 
Southland OTC generating units by December 31, 2020. See United States Environmental and Land-Use 
Legislation and Regulations —Cooling Water Intake  for further discussion of AES Southland’s plans regarding the 
OTC Policy.
The construction of the Alamitos Energy Center, an interconnected battery-based energy storage facility, 
began in June 2019 and commercial operation of the energy storage capacity was achieved on January 1, 2021.
Key Financial Drivers — AES Southland's availability is one of the most important drivers of operations, along 
with market demand and prices for gas and electricity. 19 | 2020 Annual Report
AES Hawaii
Business Description — AES Hawaii receives an energy payment from its offtaker under a PPA expiring in 
2022 , which is based on a fixed rate indexed to the Gross National Product Implicit Price Deflator. Since the energy 
payment is not directly linked to market prices for fuel, the risk arising from fluctuations in market prices for coal is 
borne by AES Hawaii. AES Hawaii has entered into fixed-price coal purchase commitments through  2021 and plans 
to seek additional fuel purchase commitments during 2021 to manage fuel price risk in 2022. 
In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature passed Senate Bill 2629 which will prohibit AES Hawaii from 
generating electricity from coal after December 31, 2022. This will restrict the Company from contracting the asset 
beyond the expiration of its existing PPA, and as a result, AES plans to retire the AES Hawaii facility in 2022.
Key Financial Drivers — AES Hawaii's financial results are driven by fuel costs and outages. The Company 
has entered into long-term fuel contracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating prices. In addition, major 
maintenance requiring units to be off-line is performed during periods when power demand is typically lower. 
Puerto Rico
Business Description — AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a coal-fired cogeneration plant and a solar plant 
of 524 MW and 24 MW, respectively, representing approximately 8% of the installed capacity in Puerto Rico. Both 
plants are fully contracted through long-term PPAs with PREPA expiring in 2027  and 2032 , respectively. AES Puerto 
Rico receives a capacity payment based on the plants' twelve month rolling average availability, receiving the full 
payment when the availability is 90% or higher. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico  
for further discussion of the long-term PPAs with PREPA.
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, improved 
operational performance and plant availability.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  — Puerto Rico has a single electric grid managed by PREPA, a 
state-owned entity that provides virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits, 
and distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau is the main regulatory body. The 
bureau approves wholesale and retail rates, sets efficiency and interconnection standards, and oversees PREPA's 
compliance with Puerto Rico's renewable portfolio standard.
Puerto Rico's electricity is 9 7% produced by thermal plants (43% from natural gas, 36% from petroleum, and 
18% from coal).  
AES Clean E nergy
Business Description — AES manages the U.S. renewables portfolio, which comprises AES Distributed 
Energy, sPower and other renewable assets, as part of its broader investments in the U.S. On January 4, 2021, the 
sPower and AES Distributed Energy development platforms were merged to form AES Clean Energy Development, 
which will serve as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S. sPower remains an AES 
unconsolidated affiliate after this merger. Collectively, AES Distributed Energy, sPower, AES Clean Energy 
Development, and the other renewable assets in the U.S. are referred to as AES Clean Energy.
Prior to the merger, both AES and sPower were recognized leaders in renewable development in the U.S. 
Together, AES Clean Energy is one of the top renewables growth platforms and the expanded team  aims to solve 
our customers' energy challenges. AES Clean Energy offers its customers an expanded portfolio of innovative 
solutions based on cutting-edge technologies that are designed to accelerate their energy futures.  Generation 
capacity of the systems owned and/or operated under AES Clean Energy is 2,983  MW across the U.S. with another 
299 MW under construction. This capacity includes 2,066  MW of solar, 1,085  MW of wind, and 131 MW of energy 
storage.
A majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures. Under 
these tax equity structures, the tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, 
including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. Based on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity 
structures, this could result in variability to earnings attributable to AES compared to the earnings reported at the 
facilities. 
Key Financial Drivers — The financial results of AES Clean Energy are primarily driven by the efficient 
construction and operation of renewable energy facilities across the U.S. under long-term PPAs, through which the 
energy price on the entire production of these facilities is guaranteed. The financial results of renewable assets are 20 | 2020 Annual Report
primarily driven by the amount of wind or solar resource at the facilities, availability of facilities, and growth in 
projects.
Laurel Mountain, Buffalo Gap II and Buffalo Gap III are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and their 
revenue may change materially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations. Laurel Mountain 
also operates 16 MW of battery energy storage that is sold into the PJM market as regulation energy. For these 
projects, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results.
Development Strategy — As states, communities, and organizations of all types make commitments and plan 
to reduce their carbon footprints, renewables are the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the U.S. AES 
Clean Energy works with its customers to co-create and deliver the smarter, greener energy solutions that meet 
their needs, including 24/7 carbon-free energy. The merged renewables platform has brought together sPower's and 
AES' differentiated capabilities in solar, wind, and energy storage to accelerate customers' energy transitions.
AES Clean Energy  has a renewable project backlog that includes 2,206 MW of projects for which long-term 
PPAs have been signed or, as applicable, tariffs have been assigned through a regulatory process. The budget for 
construction of the projects currently under construction and the contracted projects is over $3.9 billion . AES Clean 
Energy is actively developing new products and renewable sites to serve the current and future needs of its 
customers.
U.S. Environmental Regulation
For information on compliance with environmental regulations see Item 1. —United States Environmental and 
Land-Use Legislation and Regulations .
El Salvador  
Business Description — AES El Salvador is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies 
operating in El Salvador (CAESS, CLESA, EEO and DEUSEM). AES El Salvador's territory covers 77% of the 
country and accounted for 3,640  GWh of the wholesale market energy sales during 2020. AES El Salvador is also a 
50% owner and operator of Bosforo, a 100 MW solar farm. The energy produced by this solar farm is fully 
contracted by AES' utilities in El Salvador.
 In addition, AES El Salvador offers customers non-regulated services such as energy trading, 
electromechanical construction, O&M of electrical assets, EPC, pole rental, and tax collection for municipalities. 
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:
•improved operational performance; 
•variability in energy demand driven by weather; and
•the impact of fuel oil prices on energy tariff prices, which affect cash flow due to a three-month delay in the 
pass-through of energy costs to the tariffs charged to customers.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — El Salvador's national electric market is composed of 
generation, distribution, transmission, and marketing businesses, a market and system operator, and regulatory 
agencies. The operation of the transmission system and the wholesale market is based on production costs with a 
marginal economic model that rewards efficiency and allows investors to have guaranteed profits, while end users 
receive affordable rates. The energy sector is governed by the General Electricity Law, which establishes two 
regulatory entities responsible for monitoring its compliance: 
•The National Energy Council is the highest authority on energy policy and strategy, and the coordinating 
body for the different energy sectors. One of its main objectives is to promote investment in non-
conventional renewable sources to diversify the energy matrix.
•The General Superintendence of Electricity and Telecommunications regulates the market and sets 
consumer prices, and, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, developed the tariff calculation 
applicable from 2018 until 2022. The next tariff calculation is scheduled for 2022, and will be effective 
starting in 2023.
El Salvador has a national electric grid that interconnects directly with Guatemala and Honduras, allowing 
transactions with all Central American countries. The sector has approximately 1,799 MW of installed capacity, 
composed of thermal (40%), hydroelectric (31%), solar (11%), biomass (9%), and geothermal (9%) generation 
plants.
Development Strategy — In order to explore new business opportunities, AES El Salvador created AES 21 | 2020 Annual Report
Soluciones, an LED public  lighting service provider and the main commercial and industrial solar photovoltaic EPC 
provider in the country. AES Next is also the O&M services provider for the Bosforo project.22 | 2020 Annual Report

Chile
Business Description — In Chile, through AES Gener, we are engaged in the generation and supply of 
electricity (energy and capacity) in the SEN—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Gener is 
the second largest generation operator in Chile in terms of installed capacity with 3,450  MW, excluding energy 
storage, and has a market share of approximately 13% as of December 31, 2020.
AES Gener owns a diversified generation portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers, and 
energy resources. AES Gener's generation plants are located near the principal electricity consumption centers, 
including Santiago, Valparaiso, and Antofagasta. AES Gener's diverse generation portfolio provides flexibility for the 
management of contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers, provides backup energy to the 
spot market and facilitates operations under a variety of market and hydrological conditions. 
AES Gener's Green Blend and Extend strategy aims to reduce carbon intensity and incorporate renewable 
energy to extend our existing conventional PPAs. This strategy de-links our PPAs from legacy fossil resources, 
grows our renewable energy portfolio, and delivers a competitive, reliable energy solution. In line with the "green 
blend and extend" strategy, AES Gener has committed to not build additional coal-based power plants and to 
advance the development of new renewable projects, including the implementation of battery energy storage 
systems ("BESS") and other technological innovations that will provide greater flexibility and reliability to the system.
AES Gener currently has long-term contracts, with an average remaining term of approximately 9 years, with 
regulated distribution companies and unregulated customers, such as mining  and industrial companies. In general, 26 | 2020 Annual Report
these long-term contracts include pass-through mechanisms for fuel costs along with price indexations to U.S. 
Consumer Price Index ("CPI").
In addition to energy payments, AES Gener also receives capacity payments to compensate for availability 
during periods of peak demand. The grid operator, Coordinador Electrico Nacional ("CEN"), annually determines the 
capacity requirements for each power plant. The capacity price is fixed semiannually by the National Energy 
Commission and indexed to the CPI and other relevant indices.
Key Financial Drivers — Hedge strategy at AES Gener limits volatility to the underlying financial drivers. In 
addition, financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 
•dry hydrology scenarios; 
•forced outages; 
•changes in current regulatory rulings altering the ability to pass through or recover certain costs;
•fluctuations of the Chilean peso;

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Chilean electricity industry is divided into three business 
segments: generation, transmission, and distribution. Private companies operate in all three segments, and 
generators can enter into PPAs to sell energy to regulated and unregulated customers, as well as to other 
generators in the spot market.
Chile operates in a single power market, referred to as the SEN, which is managed by the grid operator CEN. 
The SEN has an installed capacity of 26,056 MW, and represents 99% of the installed generation capacity of the 
country.
CEN coordinates all generation and transmission companies in the SEN. CEN minimizes the operating costs 
of the electricity system, while maximizing service quality and reliability requirements. CEN dispatches plants in 
merit order based on their variable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available 
cost. In the south-central region of the SEN , thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill demand not satisfied by 
hydroelectric, solar, and wind output and is critical to provide reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry 
hydrological conditions in the highest demand area of the SEN. In the northern region of the SEN, which includes 
the Atacama Desert, thermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for 
thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel, and LNG, are indexed to international prices . In 2020, the installed 
generation capacity  in the Chilean market was composed of 48% thermoelectric, 27% hydroelectric, 13% solar, 10% 
wind, and 2% other fuel sources. 
Hydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's installed capacity. Precipitation and snow 
melt impact hydrological conditions in Chile. Rain occurs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from 
September to December. These factors affect dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation 
plants, thereby influencing spot market prices. 
The Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the 
National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels.
All generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to 
unregulated customers. Unregulated customers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 5 MW. 
Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 5.0 MW can opt for regulated or unregulated contracts for 
a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase all 
electricity under contracts. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term 
basis at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile are denominated in USD, although 
payments are made in Chilean pesos.
The Chilean government’s decarbonization plan includes the complete retirement of the SEN coal fleet by the 
end of 2040 and carbon neutrality by 2050. During the year, AES Gener announced its commitment to shut down its 
Ventanas 1 coal-fired plant in 2020 and its Ventanas 2 coal-fired plant in June 2022 or earlier, pending resolution of 
current transmission constraints, and to disconnect both plants from the SEN in 2025. On December 26, 2020, the 27 | 2020 Annual Report
Ministry of Energy’s Supreme Decree Number 42 went into effect, allowing coal plants to enter into Strategic 
Reserve Status (“SRS”) and receive 60% of capacity payments for the 5-year period following its shutdown to 
remain connected as a backup in case of a system emergency. Following the issuance of this regulation and per the 
disconnection and termination agreement signed with the Chilean government in June 2019, the Ventanas 1 power 
plant was shut down on December 29, 2020 to enter into SRS.
Environmental Regulatio n — In March 2019, a new decontamination plan for the Ventanas region was 
approved. We are currently implementing the requirements defined by the plan which will impact our Ventanas  and 
Guacolda businesses.
Chilean law requires all electricity generators to supply a certain portion of their total contractual obligations 
with non-conventional renewable energy ("NCREs"). Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by 
building NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and small hydroelectric technology) or 
purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Non-compliance with the NCRE requirements will result in fines. AES 
Gener currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Gener's solar and biomass power plants and by 
purchasing NCREs from other generation companies. At present, AES Gener is in the process of negotiating 
additional NCRE supply contracts to meet future requirements. 
Since 2017, emissions of particulate matter, SO 2, NO X, and CO 2 are monitored for plants with an installed 
capacity over 50 MW; these emissions are taxed. In the case of CO 2, the tax is equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. 
Certain PPAs have clauses allowing the Company to pass the green tax costs to unregulated customers, while 
some distribution PPAs do not allow for the pass through of these costs.
Development Strategy — AES Gener is committed to reducing the coal intensity of the Chilean power grid and 
plans to increase the renewable energy capacity in its portfolio. As part of this commitment, and in addition to the 
531 MW hydroelectric generation that Alto Maipo will deliver to the system, AES Gener purchased the 110 MW Los 
Cururos wind farm and its substation in northern Chile, and has finished construction on the 80 MW Andes 2a 
facility. Also under construction are the 110 MW Los Olmos wind farm, 66 MW Mesamávida wind farm, 73 MW 
Campo Lindo wind farm, and 180 MW Andes Solar 2b facility, which also includes 112 MW of BESS, to supply 
agreements with its main mining customers in execution of the new Green Blend and Extend strategy. In total, the 
pipeline currently has 4.4 GW under development at different stages and diversified geographically.
AES Gener executes its Green Blend and Extend strategy by integrating renewable energy sources into its 
portfolio, and by providing contracting options that contain a mix of both renewable and nonrenewable solutions. 
Colombia
Business Description — We operate in Colombia through AES Chivor, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which owns 
a hydroelectric plant with an installed capacity of 1,000  MW and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric plant, 
both located approximately 160 km east of Bogota, as well as Castilla, a 21 MW solar facility. AES Chivor’s installed 
capacity accounted for approximately 6% of system capacity at the end of 2020. AES Chivor is dependent on 
hydrological conditions, which influence generation and spot prices of non-contracted generation in Colombia.
AES Chivor's commercial strategy aims to execute contracts with commercial and industrial customers and bid 
in public tenders, mainly with distribution companies, in order to reduce margin volatility with proper portfolio risk 
management. The remaining energy generated by our portfolio is sold to the spot market, including ancillary 
services. Additionally, AES Chivor receives reliability payments for maintaining the plant's availability and generating 
firm energy during periods of power scarcity, such as adverse hydrological conditions, in order to prevent power 
shortages. 
Key Financial Drivers — Hydrological conditions largely influence Chivor's power generation. Maintaining the 
appropriate contract level, while maximizing revenue through the sale of excess generation, is key to Chivor's 
results of operations. In addition to hydrology, financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited 
to: 
•forced outages;
•fluctuations of the Colombian peso; and
•spot market prices.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main 
system, the SIN, which encompasses one-third of Colombia's territory, providing electricity to 97% of the country's 
population. The SIN's installed capacity, primarily hydroelectric (69%) and thermal (31%), totaled 17,473 MW as of 28 | 2020 Annual Report
December 31, 2020. The marked seasonal variations in Colombia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-
term market. In 2020, 72% of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric plants.
The electricity sector in Colombia operates under a competitive market framework for the generation and sale 
of electricity, and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution of electricity. The distinct activities of the 
electricity sector are governed by Colombian laws and CREG, the Colombian regulating entity for energy and gas. 
Other government entities have a role in the electricity industry, including the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which 
defines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in 
charge of overseeing utility companies; and the Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which is in charge of expansion of 
the generation and transmission network. 
The generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the 
wholesale market at the short-term price or under bilateral contracts with other participants, including distribution 
companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at freely negotiated prices. The National Dispatch 
Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by 
the lowest cost combination of available generating units.
Development Strategy — AES Colombia is committed to transform into a renewable growth platform by 
supporting its customers to diversify their energy supply and become more competitive. As part of this commitment, 
AES Colombia is developing a pipeline of 1.3 GW of solar and wind projects. Five projects (648 MW) of wind energy 
are located in La Guajira, one of the windiest spots on Earth, and two projects (255 MW) were awarded a 15-year 
PPA at the last r enewable auction. One project (99 MW) of the Wind Cluster has Environmental License  and the 
others are progressing smoothly in their development process. During 2020, AES Colombia was awarded the 61 
MW San Fernando Solar project through a 15-year PPA with Ecopetrol and started construction in September. This 
solar project, along with the 21 MW Castilla project built in 2019 also with a PPA with Ecopetrol, has been 
fundamental in leading the renewable market in Colombia.
Argentina
Business Description — AES operates plants in Argentina totaling 4,220  MW, representing 10% of the 
country's total installed capacity. AES owns a diversified generation portfolio in Argentina in terms of geography, 
technology, and fuel source. AES Argentina's plants are placed in strategic locations within the country in order to 
provide energy to the spot market and customers, making use  of wind, hydro, and thermal plants.
AES primarily sells its energy in the wholesale electricity market where prices are largely regulated. In 2020, 
approximately 90% of the energy was sold in the wholesale electricity market and 10% was sold under contract 
sales made by TermoAndes, Vientos Neuquinos, and Vientos Bonaerenses power plants.
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 
•forced outages; 
•exposure to fluctuations of the Argentine peso;
•changes in hydrology and wind resource s;
•timely collection of FONINVEMEM installments and outstanding receivables (see Regulatory Framework 
and Market Structure below); and
•natural gas prices and availability for contracted generation  at Termoandes.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — Argentina has one main power system, the SADI, which 
serves 96% of the country. As of December 31, 2020, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 41,991 MW. The 
SADI's installed capacity is composed primarily of thermoelectric generation (61%) and hydroelectric generation 
(27%),  as well as wind (6%), nuclear (4%), and solar (2%) . 
Thermoelectric generation in the SADI is primarily natural gas. However, scarcity of natural gas during winter 
periods (June to August) due to transport constraints result in the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The 
SADI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants. Hydrological conditions impact reservoir water levels and largely 
influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants and, therefore, influence 
market costs. Precipitation in Argentina occurs principally from June to August. 
The Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission, and 
distribution. The wholesale electric market is comprised of generation companies, transmission companies, 
distribution companies, and large customers who are permitted to trade electricity. Generation companies can sell 29 | 2020 Annual Report
their output in the spot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is responsible for 
dispatch coordination. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities 
and the Secretariat of Energy regulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector 
activities. In Argentina, there is a tolling scheme in which the regulator establishes prices for electricity and defines 
fuel reference prices. As a result, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation.
The Argentine electric market is an "average cost" system. Generators are compensated for fixed costs and 
non-fuel variable costs, under prices denominated in Argentine pesos. CAMMESA is in charge of providing the 
natural gas and liquid fuels required by the generation companies, except for coal.
During 2020, the government has maintained prices to the end user, increasing subsidies and the system 
deficit. By December 2020, distribution companies recovered an average 55% of the total cost of the system.
AES Argentina contributed certain accounts receivable to fund the construction of new power plants under 
FONINVEMEM agreements. These receivables accrue interest and have been collected in monthly installments 
over 10 years after commercial operation date of the related plant took place. AES Argentina participated in the 
construction of three power plants under the FONINVEMEM structure, and in addition to the repayment of the 
accounts receivable contributed, AES Argentina will receive a pro rata ownership interest in each of these plants 
once the accounts receivables have been fully repaid.  FONINVEMEM I and II installments were fully repaid in the 
first quarter of 2020 and the ownership interests in Termoeléctrica San Martín and Termoeléctrica Manuel Belgrano 
power plants are subject to agreement between the government and all generators that participated in the funds. 
FONINVEMEM III installments, related to Termoeléctrica Guillermo Brown which commenced operations in April 
2016, are still being collected.  See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Long-Term Receivables  and Note 7.—Financing 
Receivables  in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K  for further discussion of 
receivables in Argentina.
In 20 19 and 2020, the Argentine peso devalued against the USD by approximately 37% and 29%, 
respectively, and Argentina’s economy continued to be highly inflationary. Since September 2019, currency controls 
have been established to govern the devaluation of the Argentine peso and keep Argentine central bank reserves at 
acceptable levels for the next government of Argentina . 
Development Strategy — Currently, 800 MW of renewable greenfield projects are in early and mid stages of 
development. These projects could be used to participate in future private PPAs or public auctions. In addition, 
"behind the meter” and off-grid solutions are being developed for the industrial sector (mining), including solar power 
plants plus BESS.
Brazil
Business Description — AES Brasil (the business formerly branded as AES Tietê ) has a portfolio of 12 
hydroelectric power plants in the state of São Paulo with total installed capacity of 2,658  MW. These hydroelectric 
plants operate under a 30-year concession expiring in 2029 . 
Over the past three years, AES Brasil acquired and developed  two solar power complexes in the state of São 
Paulo, which are fully contracted with 20-year PPAs and together account for 294 MW  of installed capacity. AES 
Brasil represents approximately  12% of the total generation capacity in the state of São Paulo. 
AES Brasil also owns Alto Sertão II, a wind complex located in the state of Bahia with an installed capacity of 
386 MW and subject to 20-year PPAs expiring between 2033 and 2035, and in December 2020, also acquired the 
Ventus wind complex located in the State of Rio Grande do Norte with an installed capacity of 187 MW and subject 
to a 20-year PPA expiring in 2032.
In the second half of 2020, AES acquired an additional 1 9.8% ownership in AES Brasil . As of December 31, 
2020, AES owns 44% of AES Brasil and is the controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business . 
As a result of the transaction, AES has also committed to transition the listing of AES Brasil's shares to the Novo 
Mercado, a listing segment of the Brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance. 
The transition to Novo Mercado is expected to occur in the first half of 2021.
In December 2020, AES Brasil entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the MS Wind and Santos Wind 
Complexes, located in the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará, respectively. The complexes have been 30 | 2020 Annual Report
operational since 2013 with 159 MW of installed capacity, fully sold in the regulated market for 20 years.
AES Brasil aims to contract most of its physical guarantee requirements and sell the remaining portion in the 
spot market. The commercial strategy is reassessed periodically according to changes in market conditions, 
hydrology, and other factors. AES Brasil generally sells available energy through medium-term bilateral contracts. 
Key Financial Drivers — The electricity market in Brazil is highly dependent on hydroelectric generation, 
therefore electricity pricing is driven by hydrology. Plant availability is also a significant financial driver as in times of 
high hydrology, AES is more exposed to the spot market. AES Brasil's financial results are driven by many factors, 
including, but not limited to:
•hydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in the MRE (see Regulatory Framework and Market 
Structure below for further information);
•growth in demand for energy;
•market price risk when re-contracting;
•asset management;
•cost management; and
•ability to execute on its growth strategy.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the 
maximum amount of energy a generation plant can sell, called physical guarantee, representing the long-term 
average expected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, physical guarantee energy can be sold to 
distribution companies through long-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large 
consumers or energy trading companies. 
Brazil has installed capacity of 176 GW, composed of hydr oelectric (62%), thermoelectric (25%), renewable 
(12%), and nuclear (1%) sources. Operation is centralized and controlled by the national operator, ONS, and 
regulated by the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (" ANEEL "). The ONS dispatches generators based on 
their marginal cost of production and on the risk of system rationing. Key variables for the dispatch decision are 
forecasted hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand, fuel prices, and thermal generation 
availability. 
In case of unfavorable hydrology, the ONS will reduce hydroelectric dispatch to preserve reservoir levels and 
increase dispatch of thermal plants to meet demand. The consequences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) higher 
energy spot prices due to higher energy production costs by thermal plants and (ii) the need for hydro plants to 
purchase energy in the spot market to fulfill their contractual obligations. 
A mechanism known as the  MRE  was created under ONS to share hydrological risk across MRE hydro 
generators by using a generation scaling factor ("GSF") to adjust generators' physical guarantee during periods of 
hydrological scarcity. If the hydro plants generate less than the total MRE physical guarantee, the hydro generators 
may need to purchase energy in the short-term market. When total hydro generation is higher than the total MRE 
physical guarantee, the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they may sell the excess energy 
on the spot market. 
In September 2020, Law 14.052/2020 published by ANEEL was approved by the President, establishing terms 
for compensation to MRE hydro generators for the incorrect application of the GSF mechanism from 2013 to 2018, 
which resulted in higher charges assessed to MRE hydro generators by the regulator. Under the law, potential 
compensation will be in the form of an offer for a concession extension for each hydro generator in exchange for full 
payment of billed GSF trade payables, the amount of which will be reduced in conjunction with the payment for a 
concession extension. See Key Trends and Uncertainties —Regulatory  in Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this Form 10-K .
Development Strategy — AES Brasil's strategy is to grow by adding renewable capacity to its generation 
platform through acquisition or greenfield projects, to focus on client satisfaction and innovation to offer new 
products and energy solutions, and to be recognized for excellence in asset management. 
In 2020, AES Brasil acquired the Tucano Project, a 582 MW greenfield wind power project in the state of 
Bahia, for which construction is scheduled to start in 2021 and when completed, will supply long-term PPAs. The 
first phase (155 MW) will be developed in 2021 through a joint venture with Unipar Carbocloro for a 20-year PPA 
starting in 2022. The second phase (167 MW) will be 100% developed by AES Brasil in 2021, for a 15-year PPA 
with Anglo American starting in 2022. AES Brasil is seeking other long-term PPAs to fulfill the remaining 260 MW.31 | 2020 Annual Report
In March 2020, AES Brasil signed two purchase option agreements for a total installed capacity up to 1,100 
MW of Cajuína greenfield wind power project in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, which are being exercised as the 
company secures long-term PPAs. In August 2020, AES Brasil signed a Shareholder Purchase Agreement ("SPA") 
for the first phase, Santa Tereza, which has installed capacity of 420 MW. Closing is expected to occur in the first 
quarter of 2021. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Ferbasa for 80 MW energy supply over a period 
of 20 years, beginning in 2024. The SPA for the second phase, São Ricardo, which has installed capacity of 437 
MW, was signed in February 2021. AES Brasil is seeking other long-term PPAs to fulfill the remaining  777 MW in 
phases 1 and 2 .
Under the current terms of the 2018 legal agreement in connection with AES Brasil's concession with the state 
government, AES Brasil is required to increase its capacity in the state of São Paulo by an additional 81 MW by 
October 2024.32 | 2020 Annual Report

MCAC Businesses
Dominican Republic 
Business Description — AES Dominicana consists of three operating subsidiaries: Itabo, Andres, and Los 
Mina. With a total of 957 MW of installed capacity, AES provides 19% of the country's capacity and supplies 
approximately 29% of the country's energy demand via these generation facilities. 873 MW is predominantly 
contracted until 2022  with government-owned distribution companies and large customers.
AES has a strategic partnership with the Estrella and Linda Groups ("Estrella-Linda"), a consortium of two 
leading Dominican industrial groups that manage a diversified business portfolio.
Itabo  is 42.5% owned by AES. Itabo owns and operates two thermal power generation units with a total of 260 
MW of installed capacity.  On June 29, 2020, AES executed a sale and purchase agreement to sell its entire 
ownership interest in Itabo. In February 2021, the sale was approved by the Superintendence of Electricity and is 
expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.
Andres and Los Mina are owned 85% by AES. Andres owns and operates a combined cycle natural gas 
turbine and an energy storage facility with combined generation capacity of 329 MW, as well as the only LNG import 
terminal in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters of storage capacity. Los Mina owns and operates a combined 
cycle with two natural gas turbines and an energy storage facility with combined generation capacity of 368 MW. 
AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchase contract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price 
linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. The LNG contract terms allow delivery to various markets in Latin America. These 
plants capitalize on the competitively-priced LNG contract by selling power where the market is dominated by fuel 
oil-based generation. Andres has a long-term contract to sell regasified LNG to industrial users within the Dominican 
Republic using compression technology to transport it within the country, thereby capturing demand from industrial 
and commercial customers.35 | 2020 Annual Report
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 
•changes in spot prices due to fluctuations in commodity prices (since fuel is a pass-through cost under the 
PPAs, any variation in oil prices will impact spot sales for both Andres and Itabo);
•contracting levels and the extent of capacity awarded; and
•growth in  domestic natural gas demand , supported by new infrastructure such as the Eastern Pipeline and 
second LNG tank .
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Dominican Republic energy market is a decentralized 
industry consisting of generation, transmission, and distribution businesses. Generation companies can earn 
revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services, and a competitive wholesale generation market. All 
generation, transmission, and distribution companies are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law.
Two main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law: 
•The National Energy Commission drafts and coordinates the legal framework and regulatory legislation. 
They propose and adopt policies and procedures to implement best practices, support the proper 
functioning and development of the energy sector, and promote investment. 
•The Superintendence  of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring compliance with legal 
provisions, rules, and technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution, and 
commercialization of electricity. They monitor behavior in the electricity market in order to prevent 
monopolistic practices. 
In addition to the two agencies responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the 
Ministry of Industry and Commerce supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as 
well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to end users.  
The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with 4,921 MW of installed capacity, composed 
of thermal (75%), hydroelectric (13%), wind (8%), and solar (4%).
Development Strategy — AES will continue to develop the commercialization of natural gas and incorporate 
partners directly in gas infrastructure projects. AES partnered with Energas in a joint venture which has been 
operating the 50 km Eastern Pipeline since February 2020. The joint venture is also developing a new LNG facility 
of 120,000 cubic meters, including additional storage, regasification, and truck loading capacity, for which 
construction is scheduled to start in 2021. This will allow AES to reach new customers who have converted, or are 
in the process of converting, to natural gas as a fuel source, and better operational flexibility. 
Panama
Business Description — AES owns and operates five hydroelectric plants totaling 705 MW of generation 
capacity, a natural gas-fired power plant with 381 MW of generation capacity, and a wind farm of 55 MW, which 
collectively represent 30% of the total installed capacity in Panama. Furthermore, AES operates an LNG 
regasification facility, a 180,000 cubic meter storage tank, and a truck loading facility which reached commercial 
operations in December 2020.
The majority of our hydroelectric plants in Panama are based on run-of-the-river technology, with the 
exception of the 260 MW Bayano plant. Hydrological conditions have an important influence on profitability. 
Variations in hydrology can result in an excess or a shortfall in energy production relative to our contractual 
obligations. Hydro generation is generally in a shortfall position during the dry season from January through May, 
which is offset by thermal generation since its behavior is opposite and complementary to hydro generation.
Our hydro and thermal assets are mainly contracted through medium to long-term PPAs with distribution 
companies. A small volume of our hydro plants are contracted with unregulated users. Our hydro assets in Panama 
have PPAs with distribution companies expiring in December 2030 for a total contracted capacity of 383 MW . Our 
thermal asset in Panama has PPAs with distribution companies for a total contracted capacity of 350 MW expiring in 
August 2028. 
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 
•changes in hydrology, which impacts commodity prices and exposes the business to variability in the cost of 
replacement power;
•fluctuations in commodity prices, mainly oil and natural gas, which affect the cost of thermal generation and 
spot prices;36 | 2020 Annual Report
•constraints imposed by the capacity of transmission lines connecting the west side of the country with the 
load, keeping surplus power trapped during the rainy season; and
•country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Panamanian power sector is composed of three distinct 
operating business units: generation, distribution, and transmission. Generators can enter into short-term and long-
term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply 
contracts with each other. Outside of PPAs, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market. 
Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity.
Three main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law: 
•The National Secretary of Energy in Panama (SNE) has the responsibilities of planning, supervising, and 
controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. The SNE proposes laws and regulations to the 
executive agencies that regulate the procurement of energy and hydrocarbons for the country. 
•The regulator of public services, known as the ASEP, is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is 
responsible for the control and oversight of public services, including electricity, the transmission and 
distribution of natural gas utilities, and the companies that provide such services.
•The National Dispatch Center (CND) implements the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale 
market. The National Dispatch Center's objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintain 
the reliability and security of the electric power system. Short-term power prices are determined on an 
hourly basis by the last dispatched generating unit. Physical generation of energy is determined by the 
National Dispatch Center regardless of contractual arrangements.
Panama's current total installed capacity is 3,854 MW, composed of hydroelectric (47%), thermal (41%), wind 
(7%), and solar (5%) generation. 
Development Strategy — Given our LNG facility’s excess capacity in Panama, the company will develop 
natural gas supply solutions for third parties such as power generators and industrial and commercial customers. 
This strategy will support a growing demand for natural gas in the region and will contribute to AES' mission by 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions as a result of using LNG. 
In addition to investing in LNG infrastructure, AES is investing in renewable projects within the region. This will 
increase complementary non-hydro renewable assets in the system and contribute to the reduction of hydrological 
risk in Panama.
Mexico
Business Description — AES has 1,361  MW of installed capacity in Mexico. The TEG and TEP pet coke-fired 
plants, located in Tamuin, San Luis Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expiring in 2027  
with a 90% availability guarantee. TEG and TEP secure their fuel under a long-term contract. 
Merida is a CCGT located on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Merida sells power to the CFE under a capacity 
and energy based long-term PPA through 2025 . Additionally, the plant purchases natural gas and diesel fuel under a 
long-term contract with one of the CFE’s subsidiaries, the cost of which is then passed through to the CFE under 
the terms of the PPA.
Mesa La Paz, a 306 MW wind project developed under a joint venture with Grupo Bal, achieved commercial 
operations in December 2019. Starting in April 2020, Mesa La Paz sells power under a long-term PPA expiring in 
2045.
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:
•fully contracting the companies, providing additional benefits from improved operational performance, 
including performance incentives and/or excess energy sales; and
•changes in the methodology to calculate spot energy prices or Locational Marginal Prices, which impacts 
the excess energy sales to the CFE (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  below) in (i) TEG and 
TEP under self-supply scheme, and (ii) Mesa La Paz under the New Market Rules .37 | 2020 Annual Report
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — Mexico´s main electrical system is called the National 
Interconnected System (SIN), which geographically covers an area from Puerto Peñasco, Sonora to Cozumel, 
Quintana Roo. Mexico also has three isolated electrical systems: (1) the Baja California Interconnected System, 
which is interconnected with the WECC; (2) the Baja California Sur Interconnected System; and (3) the Mulegé 
Interconnected System, a very small electrical system. All three are isolated from the SIN and from each other. The 
Mexican power industry comprises the activities of generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization 
segments, considering transmission and distribution to be exclusive state services.
In addition to the Ministry of Energy, three main agencies are responsible for regulating the market agents and 
their activities, monitoring compliance with the Electric Industry Law and the Market Rules, and the surveillance of 
operational compliance and management of the wholesale electricity market: 
•The Energy Regulatory Commission is responsible for the establishment of directives, orders, 
methodologies, and standards to regulate the electric and fuel markets, as well as granting permits.
•The National Center for Energy Control, as an ISO, is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity 
market, transmission and distribution infrastructure, planning network developments, guaranteeing open 
access to network infrastructure, executing competitive mechanisms to cover regulated demand, and 
setting transmission charges.
•The Electricity Federal Commission (CFE) owns the transmission and distribution grids and is also the 
country's basic supplier. CFE is the offtaker for IPP generators, and together with its own power units has 
more than 50% of the current generation market share.
Mexico has an installed capacity totaling 86 GW with a generation mix composed of thermal (65%), 
hydroelectric (15%), wind (8%), solar (7%), and other fuel sources (5%). 
Development Strategy — AES has partnered with Grupo Bal in a joint venture to co-invest in power and 
related infrastructure projects in Mexico, focusing on renewable and natural gas generation .38 | 2020 Annual Report

The following map illustrates the location of our Eurasia facilities:
Eurasia Businesses 
Vietnam
Business Description  — Mong Duong 2 is a 1,242  MW gross coal-fired plant located in the Quang Ninh 
Province of Vietnam and was constructed under a BOT service concession agreement expiring in 2040 . This is the 
first and largest coal-fired BOT plant using pulverized coal-fired boiler technology in Vietnam. The BOT company 
has a PPA with EVN and a Coal Supply Agreement with Vinacomin, both expiring in 2040. 
On December 31, 2020, AES executed an agreement to sell its entire 51% interest in the Mong Duong 2 plant. 
The sale is expected to close in late 2021 or early 2022, subject to customary approvals, including from the 
Government of Vietnam and the minority partners in Mong Duong 2 .
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, the operating 
performance and availability of the facility.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Ministry of Industry and Trade in Vietnam is primarily 
responsible for formulating a program to restructure the power industry, developing the electricity market, and 
promulgating electricity market regulations. The fuel supply is owned by the government through Vinacomin, a state-
owned entity, and PetroVietnam. 
The Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central, and South), with total installed 
capacity of approximately 54 GW. The fuel mix in Vietnam is composed primarily of hydropower at 37% and coal at 
36%. EVN, the national utility, owns 53% of installed generation capacity.
The government is in the process of realigning EVN-owned companies into three different independent 
operations in order to create a competitive power market. The first stage of this realignment was the implementation 
of the Competitive Electricity Market, which has been in operation since 2012. The second stage was the 
introduction of the Electricity Wholesale Market, which has been in operation since the beginning of 2019. The third 
and final stage impacts the Electricity Retail Market, which will undergo similar reforms after 2022. BOT power 41 | 2020 Annual Report
plants will not directly participate in the power market; alternatively, a single buyer will bid the tariff on the power 
pool on their behalf. 
Development Strategy — In Vietnam, we continue to advance the development of our Son My LNG terminal 
project, which has a design capacity of up to 9.6 million metric tonnes per annum, and the Son My 2 CCGT project, 
which has a capacity of about 2,250 MW. In October 2019, we received formal approval as a government-mandated 
investor in the Son My LNG terminal project in partnership with PetroVietnam Gas and in October 2020, we signed 
the term sheet agreement with PetroVietnam Gas for the joint venture agreement. In September 2019, we received 
formal approval as the government-mandated investor with 100% equity ownership in the Son My 2 CCGT project 
and executed a statutory memorandum of understanding with Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade in November 
2019 to continue developing the Son My 2 CCGT project under Vietnam’s Build-Operate-Transfer legal framework. 
The Son My 2 CCGT project will utilize the Son My LNG terminal project and be its anchor customer.
Bulgaria
Business Description — Our  AES Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel thermal power plant. AES Maritza's 
entire power output is contracted with NEK, the state-owned public electricity supplier, independent energy 
producer, and trading company. Maritza is contracted under a 15-year PPA that expires in May 2026 . AES Maritza 
has been collecting receivables from NEK in a timely manner since 2016. However, NEK's liquidity position remains 
subject to political conditions and regulatory changes in Bulgaria.
The DG Comp is reviewing NEK’s PPA with AES Maritza pursuant to the European Union’s state aid rules. 
AES Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in  compliance with all applicable laws. For additional details see Key 
Trends and Uncertainties  in Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations  in this Form 10-K .
AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. The 
power output of St. Nikola is sold to customers operating on the liberalized electricity market and the plant receives 
additional revenue per the terms of an October 2018 Contract for Premium with the state-owned Electricity Security 
Fund. 
Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:
•regulatory changes in the Bulgarian power market; 
•results of the DG Comp review; 
•availability and load factor of the operating units;
•the level of wind resources for St. Nikola; 
•spot market price volatility beyond the level of compensation through the Contract for Premium for St. 
Nikola; and
•NEK's ability to meet the payment terms of the PPA contract with Maritza.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The electricity sector in Bulgaria allows both regulated and 
competitive segments. In its capacity as the public provider of electricity, NEK acts as a single buyer and seller for 
all regulated transactions on the market. Electricity outside the regulated market trades on one of the platforms of 
the Independent Bulgarian Electricity Exchange day-ahead market, intra-day market, or bilateral contracts market. 
Bulgaria is working with the European Commission on the implementation of a model that allows for a gradual 
phase-out of regulated energy prices.
Bulgaria’s power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, universal access to the grid, and numerous 
cross-border connections with neighboring countries. In addition, it plays an important role in the energy balance in 
the Balkan region.
Bulgaria has 13 GW of installed capacity enabling the country to meet and exceed domestic demand and 
export energy. Installed capacity is primarily thermal (45%), hydro (25%), and nuclear (16%). 
Environmental Regulation — In 2017, new EU environmental standards were enacted that regulate emissions 
from the combustion of solid fuels for large combustion plants, known as the Best Available Techniques Reference 
Document for Large Combustion Plants, which applies to AES Maritza. AES Maritza was granted a derogation with 
respect to these standards and a formal decision for the preliminary execution of that derogation was made by the 
Bulgarian environmental authorities in Feb ruary 2021. A third-party appeal with respect to the derogation has been 42 | 2020 Annual Report
made; however, while such appeal is considered, the preliminary execution of that derogation is in full force and 
effect.
In December 2019, the EU approved the European Green  New Deal, a framework document that sets out how 
to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050. In response, in October 2020, Bulgaria submitted an updated version of 
the Integrated Energy and Climate Plan of the Republic of Bulgaria 2021-2030 ("IECP"), with national targets to 
contribute to the EU decarbonization targets, which does not include specific commitments to phase out coal plants 
before 2030. The IECP emphasizes the socio-economic importance of the indigenous coal industry in Bulgaria and 
the potential for indigenous coal to provide resources for electricity generation in the next 60 years while 
contributing to Bulgaria's energy and national security. T here are currently no EU or Bulgarian regulations that limit 
the ability of AES Maritza to operate.
Jordan
Business Description — In Jordan, AES has a 37% controlling interest in Amman East, a 381 MW oil/gas-fired 
plant fully contracted with the national utility under a 25-year PPA expiring in 2033 , a 36% controlling interest in the 
IPP4 plant, a 250 MW oil/gas-fired peaker plant fully contracted with the national utility until 2039 , and a 36% 
controlling interest in a 52 MW solar plant fully contracted with the national utility under a 20-year PPA expiring in 
2039. We consolidate the results in our operations as we have a controlling interest in these businesses.
On November  10, 2020, AES executed a sale and purchase agreement to sell approximately 26% effective 
ownership interest in both the Amman East and IPP4 plants. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2021 
subject to customary approvals, including lender consents.
Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Jordan electricity transmission market is a single-buyer 
model with the state-owned National Electric Power Company ("NEPCO") responsible for transmission. NEPCO 
generally enters into long-term PPAs with IPPs to fulfill energy procurement requests from distribution utilities. The 
sector is prioritizing renewable energy development, with 2,400 MW of renewable energy installed capacity 
expected by the end of 2021, 2,129 MW of which is already connected to the grid.
India
Development Strategy — India is a high-growth market for renewables and battery energy storage. AES owns 
and operates a test 10 MW BESS in Delhi city, located inside a substation of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited 
("TPDDL"). The BESS is integrated with the TPDDL distribution system and provides various frequency regulation 
services. Discussions of the commercial opportunities with TPDDL are ongoing. Leveraging the Delhi BESS 
experience, we are approaching similar use case opportunities with other customers in India.43 | 2020 Annual Report

dividends from 5B. 5B is in the beginning of its growth mode and is expanding its ecosystem for global reach.
Development Strategy — In addition to a large global market for third party projects, we believe there is an 
addressable market of nearly 5 GW  across our development pipeline. AES expects to utilize this technology in 
conjunction with ongoing automation and digital initiatives to speed up delivery time and lower costs. 5B technology 
has been deployed at a 2 MW AES project in Panama and is expected to be deployed at a portion of the 180 MW  
Andes Solar 2b project to be constructed in Chile.
Environmental and Land-Use Regulations
The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, 
including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations 
pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion residuals), and certain air 
emissions, such as SO 2, NO X, particulate matter, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and 
uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material 
adverse effect on certain of our U.S. or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results of operations. For 
further information about these risks, see Item 1A.— Risk Factors —Our operations are subject to significant 
government regulation and could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes ; Several of our 
businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits 
and reputational risk associated with CCR; Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and 
regulations;  and Concerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to 
increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses  in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the 
laws and regulations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within 
Item 1.— Business  of this Form 10-K under the applicable SBUs.
Many of the countries in which the Company does business have laws and regulations relating to the siting, 
construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from 
electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International 
Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are 
subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local 
country standards. The Company often has used advanced generation technologies in order to minimize 
environmental impacts, such as combined fluidized bed boilers and advanced gas turbines, and environmental 45 | 2020 Annual Report
control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO 2 emissions and selective catalytic reduction for NO x 
emissions.
Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, 
change frequently, and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur 
capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. The Company may 
be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no 
assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these 
compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results of 
operations, financial condition, and cash flows would not be materially affected.
Various licenses, permits, and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or 
approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions, or changes 
to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to 
environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3. —Legal Proceedings  in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect 
to environmental litigation and regulatory action.
United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations
In the United States, the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, 
including SO 2, NO X, particulate matter, GHGs, mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants. Certain applicable rules 
are discussed in further detail below.
CSAPR — CSAPR addresses the "good neighbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each 
state from emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state’s 
nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The CSAPR required significant reductions in SO 2 
and NO X emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate. The Company 
is required to comply with the CSAPR in several states, including Ohio, Indiana, and Maryland. The CSAPR is 
implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the 
acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA. The Company complies with CSAPR through 
operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed. 
 On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS 
("CSAPR Update Rule"). The CSAPR Update Rule finds that NO X ozone season emissions in 22 states (including 
Indiana, Maryland, and Ohio) affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, 
and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updated existing CSAPR NO X ozone 
season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implemented these budgets through 
modifications to the CSAPR NO X ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation started in the 2017 
ozone season (May-September 2017). Affected facilities began to receive fewer ozone season NO X allowances in 
2017, resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances. Additionally, on September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit 
remanded a portion of the CSAPR Update Rule to the EPA. On October 30, 2020, the EPA issued a proposed rule 
addressing 21 states’ (including Maryland and Indiana) outstanding “good neighbor” obligations with respect of the 
2008 ozone NAAQS. The proposed rule could result in affected facilities receiving fewer ozone season NO X 
allowances as soon as the 2021 ozone season. While the Company's additional CSAPR compliance costs to date 
have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction 
requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material if certain facilities will need to purchase additional 
allowances based on reduced allocations.
New Source Review ("NSR") — The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major 
emission sources, such as electric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a 
significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excluded from these 
NSR requirements, if they meet the routine maintenance, repair and replacement ("RMRR") exclusion of the CAA. 
There is ongoing uncertainty, and significant litigation, regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. 
Over the past several years, the EPA has filed suits against coal-fired power plant owners and issued NOVs to a 
number of power plant owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings  in this Form 10-K for more 
detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including an NOV issued by the EPA against IPL 
concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA. 
If NSR requirements are imposed on any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results 
could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. 46 | 2020 Annual Report
Regional Haze Rule — The EPA's "Regional Haze Rule" is intended to reduce haze and protect visibility in 
designated federal areas, and sets guidelines for determining the best available retrofit technology ("BART") at 
affected plants and how to demonstrate "reasonable progress" toward eliminating man-made haze by 2064. The 
Regional Haze Rule required states to consider five factors when establishing BART for sources, including the 
availability of emission controls, the cost of the controls, and the effect of reducing emission on visibility in Class I 
areas (including wilderness areas, national parks, and similar areas). The statute would require compliance within 
five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP or issues a federal implementation plan, although individual 
states may impose more stringent compliance schedules. In September 2017, the EPA published a final rule 
affirming the continued validity of the EPA's previous determination allowing states to rely on the CSAPR to satisfy 
BART requirements. All of the Company’s facilities that are subject to BART comply by meeting the requirements of 
CSAPR.
The second phase of the Regional Haze Rule began in 2019. States must submit regional haze plans for this 
second implementation period in 2021 to demonstrate reasonable progress towards reducing visibility impairment in 
Class I areas. States may need to require additional emissions controls for visibility impairing pollutants, including 
on BART sources, during the second implementation period. We currently cannot predict the impact of this second 
implementation period, if any, on any of our Company’s U.S. subsidiaries.
NAAQS — Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal pollutants considered harmful to public health 
and the environment, including ozone, particulate matter, NO X, and SO 2, which result from coal combustion. Areas 
meeting the NAAQS are designated "attainment areas" while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered 
"nonattainment areas." Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the 
NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at 
five-year intervals.
Based on the current and potential future ambient air standards, certain of the states in which the Company's 
subsidiaries operate have determined or will be required to determine whether certain areas within such states meet 
the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required to modify their State Implementation Plans to detail how the 
states will attain or maintain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the applicable state 
environmental regulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to 
reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulate matter, NO X, or SO 2. The compliance costs of the Company's 
U.S. subsidiaries could be material.
Beginning January 1, 2017, IPL Petersburg has been required to meet reduced SO 2 limits established in a final 
rule published by IDEM in 2015 in accordance with a new one-hour SO 2 NAAQS of 75 parts per billion. 
Improvements to the existing flue gas desulfurization  systems at IPL’s Petersburg station were required to meet the 
emission limits imposed by the rule. The IURC approved IPL’s request for NAAQS SO 2 compliance at its Petersburg 
generation station with 80% of qualifying costs recovered through a rate adjustment mechanism and the remainder 
recorded as a regulatory asset for recovery in a subsequent rate case. The approved capital cost of the NAAQS 
SO 2 compliance plan is approximately $29 million. On August 17, 2020, the EPA approved the reduced SO 2 limits 
as part of a revised Indiana State Implementation Plan concluding that Indiana has appropriately demonstrated that 
the plan provides for attainment of the 2010 SO 2 NAAQS.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions — In January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain 
stationary sources, including a pre-construction permitting program for certain new construction or major 
modifications, known as the PSD. If future modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources become subject to 
PSD for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements and the cost of compliance with such requirements 
may be material.
On October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing NSPS for new electric generating units became effective, 
establishing CO 2 emissions standards for newly constructed coal-fueled electric generating plants, which reflects 
the partial capture and storage of CO 2 emissions from the plants. The EPA also promulgated NSPS applicable to 
modified and reconstructed electric generating units, which will serve as a floor for future BACT determinations for 
such units. The NSPS could have an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct 
electric generating units in some locations. On December 20, 2018, the EPA published proposed revisions to the 
final NSPS for new, modified, and reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units proposing that the 
best system of emissions reduction for these units is highly efficient generation that would be equivalent to 
supercritical steam conditions for larger units and sub-critical steam conditions for smaller units, and not partial 
carbon capture and sequestration, as was finalized in the 2015 final NSPS. The EPA did not include revisions for 
natural-gas combined cycle or simple cycle units in the December 20, 2018 proposal. Challenges to the GHG NSPS 47 | 2020 Annual Report
are being held in abeyance at this time. 
On August 31, 2018, the EPA published in the Federal Register proposed Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. 
On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE Rule along with associated revisions to implementing regulations. 
The final ACE Rule established CO 2 emission rules for existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d) and 
replaced the EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan Rule (CPP). In accordance with the ACE Rule, the EPA determined that 
heat rate improvement measures are the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric 
generating units. The final rule requires states, including Indiana and Maryland, develop a State Plan to establish 
CO 2 emission limits for designated facilities, including IPL Petersburg's and AES Warrior Run's coal-fired electric 
generating units. States have three years to develop their plans under the rule. On February 19, 2020, Indiana 
published a First Notice for the Indiana ACE Rule indicating that IDEM intends to determine the best system of 
emissions reductions and CO 2 standards for affected units. Impacts remain largely uncertain because Indiana's 
State Plan has not yet been developed. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to the EPA 
the ACE Rule, although the parties have an opportunity to request a rehearing at the D.C. Circuit or seek a review of 
the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The impact of this decision remains uncertain.
On November 4, 2020, the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement became effective. However, on January 
20, 2021, President Biden signed and submitted an instrument for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement effective 
February 19, 2021. As such, there is some uncertainty with respect to the impact of GHG rules on IPL. The GHG 
BACT requirements will not apply at least until we construct a new major source or make a major modification of an 
existing major source, and the NSPS will not require us to comply with an emissions standard until we construct a 
new electric generating unit. We do not have any planned major modifications of an existing source or plans to 
construct a new major source at this time which are expected to be subject to these regulations. Furthermore, the 
EPA, states, and other utilities are still evaluating potential impacts of the GHG regulations in our industry. In light of 
these uncertainties, we cannot predict the impact of the EPA’s current and future GHG regulations on our 
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, but it could be material.
Due to the future uncertainty of these regulations and associated litigation, we cannot at this time determine 
the impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but we believe the cost to comply with the ACE Rule, 
should it be upheld and implemented in its current or a substantially similar form, could be material. The GHG NSPS 
remains in effect at this time, and, absent further action from the EPA that rescinds or substantively revises the 
NSPS, it could impact any Company plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in 
some locations, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Cooling Water Intake — The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and 
discharge. In particular, the Company's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA 
that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by requiring existing steam electric generating facilities to 
utilize the best technology available ("BTA") for cooling water intake structures. On August 15, 2014, the EPA 
published its final standards based on CWA Section 316(b) which require certain subject facilities to choose among 
seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, certain facilities must conduct studies to assist 
permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, are required to reduce 
entrainment of aquatic organisms. It is possible that this decision-making process, which includes permitting and 
public input, could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other 
technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity 
are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this 
final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, 
if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.
AES Southland's current plan is to comply with the SWRCB OTC Policy by shutting down and permanently 
retiring all existing generating units at AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach, and AES Redondo Beach that utilize 
OTC by the compliance dates included in the OTC Policy. New air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators 
and battery energy storage systems will be constructed at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach generating 
stations, and there is currently no plan to replace the OTC generating units at the AES Redondo Beach generating 
station. The execution of the implementation plan for compliance with the SWRCB's OTC Policy is entirely 
dependent on the Company's ability to execute on long-term PPAs to support project financing of the replacement 
generating units at AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach. The SWRCB reviews the implementation plan and 
latest information on OTC generating unit retirement dates and new generation availability to evaluate the impact on 
electrical system reliability and OTC compliance dates for specific units. 48 | 2020 Annual Report
The Company’s California subsidiaries have signed 20-year term PPAs with Southern California Edison for the 
new generating capacity, which have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Construction of 
new generating capacity began in June 2017 at AES Huntington Beach and July 2017 at AES Alamitos. The new 
air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators were constructed at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach 
generating stations. Certain  OTC units  were required to be retired in 2019 to provide interconnection capacity and/
or emissions credits prior to startup of the new generating units, and the remaining AES OTC generating units in 
California will be shutdown and permanently retired by the OTC Policy compliance dates for these units. On 
January 23, 2020, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures adopted a 
recommendation to present to the SWRCB to extend the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach and 
AES Alamitos until December 31, 2023 and AES Redondo Beach until December 31, 2021. On September 1, 2020, 
in response to a request by the state’s energy, utility, and grid operators and regulators, the SWRCB approved 
amendments to its OTC Policy. The SWRCB OTC Policy previously required the shutdown and permanent 
retirement of all remaining OTC generating units at AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach, and AES Redondo 
Beach by December 31, 2020. The amendment extends the deadline for shutdown and retirement of AES Alamitos 
and AES Huntington Beach’s remaining OTC generating units to December 31, 2023 and extends the deadline for 
shutdown and retirement of AES Redondo Beach’s remaining OTC generating units to December 31, 2021 (the 
“AES Redondo Beach Extension”). In October 2020, the cities of Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach filed a state 
court lawsuit challenging the AES Redondo Beach Extension. The outcome of the lawsuit is unclear. The respective 
facilities’ NPDES permits have been revised to allow the remaining OTC generating units at AES Alamitos, AES 
Huntington Beach, and AES Redondo Beach to continue operation beyond December 31, 2020 and in accordance 
with the amended OTC Policy. 
Power plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the 
California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA 
requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets. 
Challenges to the federal EPA's rule were filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit, although implementation of the rule was not stayed while the challenges proceeded. On July 23, 2018, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the rule. The Second Circuit later denied a petition by 
environmental groups for rehearing. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b) regulations 
and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Water Discharges — On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("the agencies") 
published a final rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S. This rule, which initially became effective 
on August 28, 2015, could expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to 
federal permitting. However, the agencies engaged in a two-step process to repeal the 2015 "Waters of the U.S." 
rule and replace it with a newly promulgated rule called the "Navigable Waters Protection" rule. The agencies 
completed the first step on October 22, 2019 by publishing the final rule repealing the 2015 “Waters of the U.S.” 
rule. In step two, the agencies issued a revised definition of waters of the U.S. on December 11, 2018 and released 
the prepublication version of the final "Navigable Waters Protection" rule on April 21, 2020. It is too early to 
determine whether the newly promulgated "Navigable Waters Protection" rule may have a material impact on our 
business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Certain of the Company's U.S.-based businesses are subject to NPDES permits that regulate specific 
industrial waste water and storm water discharges to the waters of the U.S. under the CWA. On August 28, 2012, 
the IDEM issued NPDES permits that set new water quality-based effluent discharge limits for the IPL Harding 
Street and Petersburg facilities with full compliance ultimately required by September 29, 2017. The deadline for 
Petersburg to commission a portion of the treatment system was subsequently extended to April 11, 2018.
On November 3, 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of 
the U.S. by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and 
new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash and more stringent effluent 
limitations for flue gas desulfurization wastewater. The required compliance timelines for existing sources was to be 
established between November 1, 2018 and December 31, 2023. On September 18, 2017, the EPA published a 
final rule delaying certain compliance dates of the ELG rule for two years while it administratively reconsiders the 
rule. IPL Petersburg has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and wastewater 
treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in advance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. 
businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gas desulfurization 
wastewater. On April 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded portions of the 49 | 2020 Annual Report
EPA's 2015 ELG Rule related to legacy wastewaters and combustions residual leachate. On October 13, 2020, the 
EPA published final revisions to the 2015 ELG Rule related to flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash 
transport water, but did not address the portions of the ELG rule that were remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Fifth Circuit. Petitions have been filed for judicial review of the final revisions. It is too early to determine 
whether the outcome of the decision or current or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on 
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
On April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v. County of Maui  
case related to whether a CWA permit is required when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to 
navigable waters through a nonpoint source, such as groundwater. The Court held that discharges to groundwater 
require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct 
discharge from the point source into navigable waters. On December 10, 2020, the EPA published a Notice of 
Availability of draft guidance memorandum addressing how the Supreme Court’s decision applies to NPDES 
permits. We are reviewing this decision and the EPA's draft guidance and it is too early to determine whether this 
decision may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Selenium Rule  — In June 2016, the EPA published the final national chronic aquatic life criterion for the 
pollutant selenium in fresh water. NPDES permits may be updated to include selenium water quality-based effluent 
limits based on a site-specific evaluation process, which includes determining if there is a reasonable potential to 
exceed the revised final selenium water quality standards for the specific receiving water body utilizing actual and/or 
project discharge information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict the total impacts 
of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. 
However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material. IPL would seek recovery of these 
capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee it would be successful in this regard.
Waste Management — On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation 
and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable 
minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, 
including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure 
requirements, and post-closure care. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions 
commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for 
the Nation Act ("WIN Act") was signed into law. This includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state 
permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. If this rule is 
finalized before Indiana or Puerto Rico establishes a state-level CCR permit program, AES CCR units in those 
locations could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from EPA. The EPA has indicated that it will 
implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule. On November 12, 2020, the EPA published its final Part 
B Rule, and indicated that it would address the issue of beneficial use of CCR for closure of ash ponds that are 
subject to forced closure in a separate and future rulemaking. This future rulemaking could impact IPL Petersburg 
plant’s ability to use CCR for closure of ash ponds. On August 28, 2020, the EPA published final amendments to the 
CCR Rule titled "A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure," which amends certain 
regulatory provisions that govern CCR.
The CCR rule, current or proposed amendments to the CCR rule, the results of groundwater monitoring data, 
or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and 
results of operations. IPL would seek recovery of any resulting expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we 
would be successful in this regard.
On January 2, 2020, Puerto Rico Senate Bill 1221 was signed by the Puerto Rico Governor into law and 
became effective as Act 5-2020. Act 5-2020 prohibits the disposal and unencapsulated beneficial use of CCR, 
places restrictions on storage of CCR in Puerto Rico, and requires the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and 
Environmental Resources to develop implementation regulations. As such, it is not yet possible to determine 
whether this might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980  — This act, also known as 
"Superfund," may be the source of claims against certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries from time to 
time. There is ongoing litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfill where a group of companies already 
recognized as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking a 
contribution toward the costs of assessment and remediation. DP&L is actively opposing such claims. In 2003, 
DP&L received notice that the EPA considers DP&L to be a PRP at the Tremont City landfill Superfund site. The 
EPA has taken no further action with respect to DP&L since 2003 regarding the Tremont City landfill. On October 16, 50 | 2020 Annual Report
2019, DP&L received a special notice that the EPA considers DP&L, along with other parties, to be a PRP for the 
clean-up of hazardous substances at a third-party landfill known as the Tremont City Barrel Site, located near 
Dayton, Ohio. The Company is unable to determine whether there will be any liability, or the size of any liability that 
may ultimately be assessed against DP&L at these three sites, but any such liability could be material to DP&L.
Biden Administration Actions Affecting Environmental Regulations  — On January 20, 2021, President Biden 
issued an Executive Order ("EO") titled “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to 
Tackle the Climate Crisis” directing agencies to, among other tasks, review regulations issued under the prior 
Administration to determine whether they should be suspended, revoked, or revised. As provided for by the EO, the 
EPA submitted a letter to the DOJ seeking to obtain abeyances or stays of proceedings in pending litigation that 
seeks review of regulations promulgated during the Trump Administration. The Biden Administration also issued a 
Memorandum titled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review” directing agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing any 
rules until the Biden Administration has reviewed and approved those rules. These actions may have an impact on 
regulations that may affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
International Environmental Regulations
For a discussion of the material environmental regulations applicable to the Company's businesses located 
outside of the U.S., see Environmental Regulation  under the discussion of the various countries in which the 
Company's subsidiaries operate in Item 1.— Business , under the applicable SBUs.
Customers 
We sell to a wide variety of customers. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2020  total 
revenue.  In our generation business, we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale 
customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. Our utilities sell to end-user customers in the residential, 
commercial, industrial, and governmental sectors in a defined service area.
Human Capital Management
At AES, our people are instrumental to helping us meet the world’s energy needs. Supporting our people is a 
foundational value for AES. All of our actions are grounded in the shared values that shape AES’ culture: Safety 
First, Highest Standards, and All Together. The AES Corporation is led and managed by our Chief Executive Officer 
and the Executive Leadership Team with the guidance and oversight of our Board of Directors.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 8,200  full time/permanent 
employees. The following chart  lists our full time/permanent employees by SBU:

_____________________________
*  On January 4, 2021 , the merger of sPower as part of AES Clean Energy was completed and approximately 200 additional full time/
permanent employees joined AES Clean Energy as part of the US and Utilities SBU. 
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our U.S. employees were subject to collective bargaining 
agreements. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging 
from 2021 to 2023. In addition, certain employees in non-U.S. locations were subject to collective bargaining 51 | 2020 Annual Report
agreements, representing approximately 65% of the non-U.S. workforce. Management believes that the Company's 
employee relations are favorable.
Safety
At AES, safety is one of our core values. Conducting safe operations at our facilities around the world, so that 
each person can return home safely, is the cornerstone of our daily activities and decisions. Safety efforts are led by 
our Chief Operating Officer and supported by safety committees that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the 
workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve 
workplace safety.
AES has established a Safety Management System (“SMS”) Global Safety Standard that applies to all AES 
employees, as well as contractors working in AES facilities and construction projects. The SMS requires continuous 
safety performance monitoring, risk assessment, and performance of periodic integrated environmental, health, and 
safety audits. The SMS provides a consistent framework for all AES operational businesses and construction 
projects to set expectations for risk identification and reduction, measure performance, and drive continuous 
improvements. The SMS standard is consistent with the OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 standard, and during 2020 
approximately 62% of our locations have elected to formally certify their SMS to the OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 
international standard. AES calculates lost time incident (“LTI”) rates for our employees and contractors based on 
OSHA standards, based on 200,000 labor hours, which equates to 100 workers who work 40 hours per week and 
50 weeks per year. In 2020, there was a 37% decrease in LTI cases. In 2020, AES’ LTI Rate was 0.084 for AES 
People, 0.046 for operational contractors, and 0.069 for construction contractors. In 2020, the Company had one 
work-related fatality.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the 
best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having employees 
work from home to the extent they were able, while implementing additional safety measures for employees 
continuing critical on-site work.
Talent  
We believe AES’ success depends on its ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. The skills, 
experience, and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We 
have a comprehensive approach to managing our talent and developing our leaders in order to ensure our people 
have the right skills for today and tomorrow, whether that requires us to build new business models or leverage 
leading technologies.
We emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees, we provide a range of 
development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful by focusing on 
experience and exposure, as well as formal programs including our ACE Academy for Talent Development and our 
Trainee Program.
At AES, we believe that our individual differences make us stronger. Our Diversity and Inclusion Program is 
led by our Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Governance and standards are guided by the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, with input from members of the Executive Leadership Team.
Compensation
AES’ executive compensation philosophy emphasizes pay-for-performance. Our incentive plans are designed 
to reward strong performance, with greater compensation paid when performance exceeds expectations and less 
compensation paid when performance falls below expectations. We invest significant time and resources to ensure 
our compensation programs are competitive and reward the performance of our people. Every year, AES people 
who are not part of a collective bargaining agreement are eligible for an annual merit-based salary increase. In 
addition, individuals are eligible for a salary increase if they receive a significant promotion. For non-collectively 
bargained employees at certain levels in the organization, we offer annual incentives (bonus) and long-term 
compensation to reinforce the alignment between AES' employees and AES.52 | 2020 Annual Report

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
You should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated 
by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and 54 | 2020 Annual Report
operations. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially 
different than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.— Risk Factors  include 
risks associated with our operations, governmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. 
These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations  in this Form 10-K and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes 
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results 
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected .
Risks Associated with our Operations
The operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves 
significant risks.
We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely 
affect financial and operating performance, including:
•changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled 
and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, 
disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit 
requirements, or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, 
tsunamis, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
•changes in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, 
oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; 
environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to 
install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.
Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports 
and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this 
infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in 
this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or 
unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce 
electricity. 
In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago and may require significant 
capital expenditures for maintenance. The equipment at our plants requires periodic upgrading, improvement or 
repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single 
supplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the 
ability of our plants to perform. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from 
performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a 
power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.
Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating 
large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to 
natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse 
and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal 
processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and 
management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on operational 
procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems, which 
may not preve nt the occurrence and impact of these risks.
The hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause 
significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, 
contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these 
events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, 
environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties.
Furthermore, we and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3.— 
Legal Proceedings  below. There can be no assurance that the outcomes of such matters will not have a material 
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.55 | 2020 Annual Report
We do a significant amount of business outside the U .S., including in developing countrie s.
A significant amount of our revenue is generated in developing countries and we intend to expand our 
business in certain developing countries in which AES has an existing presence. International operations, 
particularly in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;
•adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
•government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
•unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary, fiscal or environmental policies;
•high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•restrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas or other raw materials;
•threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;
•unexpected delays in permitting and governmental approvals; 
•unexpected changes or instability affecting our strategic partners in developing countries;
•failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or other applicable anti-bribery regulations;
•unwillingness of governments, agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor contracts;
•unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are 
economically advantageous to AES and less beneficial to government or private party counterparties, 
against those counterparties;
•inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;
•adverse changes in government tax policy and tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;
•difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local 
jurisdictions; and
•inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Developing projects in less developed economies also entails greater financing risks and such financing may 
only be available from multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies that require 
governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign-related risks. There can be no assurance  that project 
financing will be available.
Further, our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin caused by regulatory and 
economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations, which may increase the uncertainty of cash 
flows from these businesses.
Any of these factors could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial 
condition.
Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility 
as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets.
Some of our businesses sell or buy electricity in the spot markets when they operate at levels that differ from 
their power sales agreements or retail load obligations or when they do not have any powers sales agreements. Our 
businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising 
and falling prices in those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and generally 
reflect the variable cost of the source generation which could include renewable sources at near zero pricing or 
thermal sources subject to fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivative fuels in addition to 
other factors described below. Consequently, any changes in the generation supply stack and cost of coal, natural 
gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.
Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things:
•plant availability in the markets generally;
•availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;
•competition and new entrants;
•seasonality, hydrology and other weather conditions;56 | 2020 Annual Report
•illiquid markets;
•transmission, transportation constraints, inefficiencies and/or availability;
•renewables source contribution to the supply stack;
•increased adoption of distributed generation;
•energy efficiency and demand side resources;
•available supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude oil and refined products;
•generating unit performance;
•natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, pandemics and other catastrophic events;
•energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;
•general economic conditions that impact demand and energy consumption; and
•bidding behavior and market bidding rules.
Wholesale power prices are declining in many markets which could impact our operations 
and opportunities for future growth.
The wholesale prices offered for electricity have declined significantly in recent years in many markets in which 
we operate due to a variety of factors, including the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, low-
priced natural gas and demand side management. The levelized cost of electricity from new solar and wind 
generation sources has decreased substantially in recent years as solar panel costs and wind turbine costs have 
declined, while wind and solar capacity factors have increased. These renewable resources have no fuel costs and 
very low operational costs. In many instances, energy from these facilities are bid into the wholesale spot market at 
a price of zero or close to zero during certain times of the day, driving down the clearing price for all generators 
selling power in the relevant spot market. Also, in many markets, new PPAs have been awarded for renewable 
generation at prices significantly lower  than those awarded just a few years ago.
This trend of declining wholesale prices could continue and could have a material adverse impact on the 
financial performance of our existing generation assets to the extent they currently sell power into the spot market or 
will seek to sell power into the spot market once their PPAs expire. This trend can also make it more difficult for us 
to obtain attractive prices under new long-term PPAs for any new generation facilities we may seek to develop and 
have an adverse impact on our opportunities for new investments.
The COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious 
diseases, could impact our business and operations. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy 
consumption. COVID-19 or another pandemic could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, 
financial condition and cash flows due to, among other factors:
•further decline in customer demand as a result of general decline in business activity; 
•further destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting customers’ ability 
to pay for our services when due or at all, including downstream impacts, whereby the utilities’ customers 
are unable to pay monthly bills or receiving a moratorium from payment obligations, resulting in inability on 
the part of utilities to make payments for power supplied by our generation companies; 
•decline in business activity causing our commercial and industrial customers to experience declining 
revenues and liquidity difficulties that impede their ability to pay for power that we supply;
•government moratoriums or other regulatory or legislative actions that limit changes in pricing, delay or 
suspend customers’ payment obligations or permit extended payment terms applicable to customers of our 
utilities or to our offtakers under power purchase agreements, in particular, to the extent that such measures 
are not mitigated by associated government subsidies or other support to address any shortfall or 
deficiencies in payments;
•claims by our PPA counterparties for delay or relief from payment obligations or other adjustments, including 
claims based on force majeure or other legal grounds; 
•further decline in spot electricity prices; 
•the destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting our customer growth 
in our service territories at our utilities;57 | 2020 Annual Report
•negative impacts on the health of our essential personnel and on our operations as a result of implementing 
stay-at-home, quarantine, curfew and other social distancing measures;
•delays or inability to access, transport and deliver fuel to our generation facilities due to restrictions on 
business operations or other factors affecting us and our third-party suppliers;
•delays or inability to access equipment or the availability of personnel to perform planned and unplanned 
maintenance, which can, in turn, lead to disruption in operations; 
•a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity, including increased cybersecurity attacks related 
to the work-from-home environment; 
•further delays to our construction projects, including at our renewables projects, and the timing of the 
completion of renewables projects; 
•delay or inability to receive the necessary permits for our development projects due to delays or shutdowns 
of government operations;
•delays in achieving our financial goals, strategy and digital transformation;
•deterioration of the credit profile of The AES Corporation and/or its subsidiaries and difficulty accessing the 
capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global 
financial markets, or deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which could affect our access to capital 
necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis; 
•delays or inability to complete asset sales on anticipated terms or to redeploy capital as set forth in our 
capital allocation plans;
•increased volatility in foreign exchange and commodity markets; 
•deterioration of economic conditions, demand and other related factors resulting in impairments to goodwill 
or long-lived assets; and
•delay or inability in obtaining regulatory actions and outcomes that could be material to our business, 
including for recovery of COVID-19 related losses and the review and approval of our rates at our U.S. 
regulated utilities.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also depends on factors, including the effectiveness and timing of 
vaccine development and distribution efforts, the development of more virulent COVID-19 variants as well as third-
party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. The COVID-19 pandemic presents 
material uncertainty that could adversely affect our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, 
development projects, energy storage sales by Fluence, and results of operations, financial condition and cash 
flows. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten many of the other risks described in this section.
Adverse economic developments in China could have a negative impact on demand for 
electricity in many of our markets. 
The Chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing for commodities over the past 
decade. Many of these commodities are produced in our key electricity markets. After experiencing rapid growth for 
more than a decade, China’s economy has experienced decreasing foreign and domestic demand, weak 
investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a significant 
slowdown in recent years. U.S. tariffs have also had a negative impact on China's economic growth. Continued 
slowing in China’s economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in policy could result in 
lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets, which could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
We may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.
Power generation, distribution and transmission involves hazardous activities. We may become exposed to 
significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. Furthermore, 
through AGIC, AES’ captive insurance company, we take certain insurance risk on our businesses. We maintain an 
amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance it will be sufficient or 
effective in light of all circumstances, hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Our insurance does not 
cover every potential risk associated with our operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always 
obtainable. In particular, the availability of insurance for coal-fired generation assets has decreased as certain 
insurers have opted to discontinue or limit offering insurance for such assets. Certain insurers have also withdrawn 
from insuring hydroelectric assets. We cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be 58 | 2020 Annual Report
available in the amounts or on terms similar to our current policies. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the 
liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as natural catastrophes, equipment failure or labor 
dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not adequately covered by insurance could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, results or operations, financial condition, and prospects.
We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts that reduce volatility in our results.
Many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps 
these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a 
stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number 
of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of 
the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one 
to more than 20 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-
term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of 
operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the 
relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements 
are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below 
current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of 
the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our 
strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, 
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it 
may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new 
development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to 
purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. 
We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts by entering into power sales 
contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign 
governments of the customer's obligations; however, many of our customers do not have or have not maintained, 
investment-grade credit ratings. Our generation businesses cannot always obtain government guarantees and if 
they do, the government may not have an investment grade credit rating. We have also located our plants in 
different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns; however, there can be no 
assurance that our efforts will be effective.
Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.
The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable 
competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including 
both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to, or greater than, ours. Further, in recent years, 
the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both 
obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors 
have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused 
higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive 
electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and 
solar have also caused, and could continue to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or 
intend to sell power. In addition, the introduction of low-cost disruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditional 
competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition. 
Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose us to significant financial credit or 
performance risks.
We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, 
transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of some of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot 
perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market 
price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, 
which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result 
in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders. Further, our 
suppliers may source certain materials f rom areas  impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause delays 
and/or disruptions to our development projects or operations.59 | 2020 Annual Report
The financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, 
suppliers and customers. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant 
portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of 
the anticipated revenue from a given facility. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to 
perform their obligations, due to bankruptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. Furthermore, in the event 
of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceeding, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing PPA under 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar bankruptcy laws, including those in Puerto Rico. We may not be able to enter 
into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, and may have to sell power at 
market prices. A counterparty's breach by of a PPA or other agreement could also result in the breach of other 
agreements, including the affected businesses debt agreements. Any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its 
contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
We may incur significant expenditures to adapt to our businesses to technological changes.
Emerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, 
investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may 
result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to 
anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products that meet customer 
demands and evolving industry standards. Technological changes that could impact our businesses include:
•technologies that change the utilization of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets, including 
the expanded cost-effective utilization of distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar and community solar 
projects), and energy storage technology;
•advances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage that reduce demand for large-scale 
renewable electricity generation or impact our customers’ performance of long-term agreements; and
•more cost-effective batteries for energy storage, advances in solar or wind technology, and advances in 
alternative fuels and other alternative energy sources.
Emerging technologies may also allow new competitors to more effectively compete in our markets or 
disintermediate the services we provide our customers, including traditional utility and centralized generation 
services. If we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes, fail to adapt to significant 
technological changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion of any 
remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, 
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
Cyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.
Our business relies on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission 
and distribution infrastructure. We also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. Our 
infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. Such an attack, by 
hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control 
our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third 
parties. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach may:
•impact our operations, revenue, strategic objectives, customer and vendor relationships; 
•expose us to legal claims and/or regulatory investigations and proceedings; 
•require extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future attacks; and
•impair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities.
•impact our financial and accounting systems and, subsequently, our ability to correctly record, process and 
report financial information.
We have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including 
certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. To date, cyber-attacks have not had a 
material impact on our operations or financial results. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities 
and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and 
implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our 
security policies as well as those for third-party providers. We cannot guarantee the extent to which our security 
measures will prevent future cyber-attacks and security breaches or that our insurance coverage will adequately 60 | 2020 Annual Report
cover any losses we may experience. Further, we do not control certain of joint ventures or our equity method 
investments and cannot guarantee that their efforts will be effective.
Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology.
Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our 
businesses forecast electric sales based on best available information and expectations for weather, which 
represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns 
and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can 
prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter 
and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for 
energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather 
where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.
Changes in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not 
limited to, our wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by 
wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, our 
results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results of operations generally, may 
vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources 
are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected. In addition, 
we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in 
which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack 
conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.
To the extent that hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions negatively affect our 
hydroelectric generation business, such as has happened in Panama in 2019, our results of operations can be 
materially adversely affected. Additionally, our contracts in certain markets where hydroelectric facilities are 
prevalent may require us to purchase power in the spot markets when our facilities are unable to operate at 
anticipated levels and the price of such spot power may increase substantially in times of low hydrology. 
Severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business.  
Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the 
price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as 
hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events, earthquakes, dam failures and tsunamis can be destructive and could 
prevent us from operating our business in the normal course by causing power outages and property damage, 
reducing revenue, affecting the availability of fuel and water, causing injuries and loss of life, and requiring us to 
incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power 
and to access available financing sources. Our power plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should 
changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more 
intense, frequent and extreme weather events, including heatwaves, fewer cold temperature extremes, abnormal 
levels of precipitation resulting in river and coastal urban floods in North America or reduced water availability and 
increased flooding across Central and South America, and changes in coast lines due to sea level change. 
Depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could 
cause catastrophic fires; releases of natural gas, natural gas odorant, or other greenhouse gases; explosions, spills 
or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health 
impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Such incidents may also impact our business 
partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to 
provide electricity and natural gas to our customers. 
A disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, 
transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or 
otherwise, could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse 
consequences described above. At our businesses where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore 
service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the 
regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred. Any of the foregoing could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects. 61 | 2020 Annual Report
Our development projects are subject to substantial uncertainties.
We are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants. Certain of these power plant projects 
have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion of 
the development of these projects depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including risks relating to siting, 
financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential 
for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. In certain cases, our 
subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though they have not yet secured 
financing, PPAs, or other important elements for a successful project. For example, our subsidiaries may instruct 
contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment without having financing, a PPA or 
critical permits in place (or enter into a PPA, procurement agreement or other agreement without agreed financing). 
If the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may retain certain liabilities. Furthermore, we may undertake 
significant development costs and subsequently not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized 
costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual 
project reach commercial operation. If development efforts are not successful, we may abandon certain projects, 
resulting in, writing off the costs incurred, expensing related capitalized development costs incurred and incurring 
additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.
We do not control certain aspects of our joint ventures or our equity method investments. 
We have invested in some joint ventures in which our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment 
and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint 
venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on 
management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. 
However, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business and we may be dependent on 
our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise 
control such projects or businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may 
not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes 
necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. In 
some joint venture agreements in which we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into 
shareholder agreements granting minority rights to the other shareholders. 
The approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly 
owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by our joint 
venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions that are different from the 
decisions we would make and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. In addition, if a joint 
venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to or share of liabilities 
for the joint venture, we may be responsible for meeting certain obligations of the joint ventures to the extent 
provided for in our governing documents or applicable law. 
In addition, we are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate 
and control such projects or businesses. While we may exert influence pursuant to having positions on the boards 
of such investments and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we 
do not always have this type of influence and the scope and impact of such influence may be limited. The 
management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, 
human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, 
and they may not share our business priorities, which could have a material adverse effect on value of such 
investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties.
Wind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. Some of these business lines are 
dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty 
about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. In particular, in the 
U.S., AES’ renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal, state and local government 
policies and incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy 
generation projects, including investment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable 
portfolio standards, feed-in-tariffs and similar programs, renewable energy credit mechanisms, and tax exemptions. 
If these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or AES is unable to use them, there could be a material 
adverse impact on AES’ U.S. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future PPAs or lower prices in future 62 | 2020 Annual Report
PPAs, decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing 
costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing.
Furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or 
sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For our wind projects, wind resource estimates are 
based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent 
engineer. These wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given 
year, but long-term averages of a resource.  
As a result, these types of projects face considerable risk, including that favorable regulatory regimes expire or 
are adversely modified. At the development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results 
may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that 
some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed-price contracts for the major cost and revenue 
components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. 
These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third-party financing, 
which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop or obtain 
third-party financing for these projects.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position.
Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated 
with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with 
transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements 
are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared 
using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate 
exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies where 
our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our foreign 
operations expenses are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction 
exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. 
Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations.
We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or 
interest rates.
We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel 
requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part 
of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, 
financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into 
contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our 
assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the 
risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of 
commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate 
volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not 
protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact 
our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of 
economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility 
in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk," which is the difference in 
performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation 
facility). Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to 
perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing 
strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of 
a counterparty default. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, 
the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of 
our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting 
commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.
Our utilities businesses may experience slower growth in  customers or in customer usage.
Customer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by external factors, including 
mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic 63 | 2020 Annual Report
conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the 
overall level of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand 
for electricity may cause us to not realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension 
plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.
We have 28 defined benefit plans, five at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, 
which cover substantially all of the employees at these subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of 
actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span 
of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension 
obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets 
compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan 
assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Downturns in the debt and/or 
equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' 
pension plan obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements. 
Our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by 
law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under 
the pension plan, which may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely 
affect our and our subsidiaries' liquidity. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting 
Policies and Estimates—Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  and Note 15—Benefit Plans  included in Item 8.—
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .
Impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results 
of operations and net worth.
As of December 31, 2020 , the Company had approximately $1.1 billion  of goodwill, which represented 
approximately 3% of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or 
more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of 
goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, such as: deterioration in 
general economic conditions or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; lower 
forecasted revenue; increase in fuel costs, particularly costs that we are unable to pass through to customers; 
increase in environmental compliance costs; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, 
particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; developments in our strategy; divestiture of 
a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. For example, Gener's 
$868 million  goodwill balance was considered to be "at risk" for impairment in 2020, l argely due to the Chilean 
Government's announcement to phase out coal generation by 2040, and a decline in long-term energy prices. As a 
result of the long-lived asset impairments at Gener during the third quarter of 2020, the Company determined there 
was a triggering event requiring a reassessment of goodwill impairment at September 1, 2020. The Company 
determined the fair value of its Gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 13%, and is not currently 
considered "at risk". We continue to monitor the Gener reporting unit for potential interim goodwill impairment 
triggering events. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis —Key Trends and Uncertainties—
Impairments . These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment. Additionally, 
goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. Long-lived assets are initially recorded at 
fair value, are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives, and are evaluated for impairment only 
when impairment indicators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present. Any impairment of goodwill 
or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, 
and prospects.
Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.
Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy and we may continue to make 
acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no 
history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the 
country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may have been government 
owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire 
any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in transitioning them to 
private ownership or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities. Further, we may incur integration or 64 | 2020 Annual Report
other one-time costs that are greater than expected. Such businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow to 
support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; and the rate 
of return from such businesses may not justify our investment of capital to acquire them.
Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws
Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and could be adversely 
affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.
Our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including 
obtaining expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased 
expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes 
in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our 
utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, 
including:
•changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-
through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs 
incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;
•changes in the determination of an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or that a utility's operating 
income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a rate reduction or consumer rebates;
•changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;
•changes in tax law;
•changes in law or regulation that limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including 
sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us;
•changes in environmental law that impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities;
•changes in the definition of events that qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
•changes in the timing of tariff increases;
•other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; 
•other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or
•other changes that impact the short- or long-term price-setting mechanism in the our markets.
Furthermore, in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing 
and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses.  The impacts described above could 
also result from our efforts to comply with European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which includes regulations 
related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and  similar regulations may be passed in other 
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower operating margins and 
financial results for the affected businesses.
Several of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, 
enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR.
CCR generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites, is currently handled and/or has 
been handled by: placement in onsite CCR ponds; disposal and beneficial use in onsite and offsite permitted, 
engineered landfills; use in various beneficial use applications, including encapsulated uses and structural fill; and 
used in permitted offsite mine reclamation. CCR currently remains onsite at several of our facilities, including in 
CCR ponds. Th e EPA's final CCR rule provides that enforcement actions can be commenced by the EPA, states, or 
territories, and private lawsuits. Compliance with the U.S. federal CCR rule; amendments to the federal CCR rule; or 
federal, state, territory, or foreign rules or programs addressing CCR may require us to incur substantial costs. In 
addition, the Company and our businesses may face CCR-related lawsuits in the United States and/or 
internationally that may expose us to unexpected potential liabilities. Furthermore, CCR-related litigation may also 
expose us to unexpected costs. In addition, CCR, and its production at several of our facilities, have been the 
subject of significant interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and have received national and 
local media attention. The direct and indirect effects of such media attention, and the demands of responding to and 
addressing it, may divert management time and attention. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect 
on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.65 | 2020 Annual Report
Some of o ur U.S. businesses are subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations 
administered by FERC, NERC and by state utility commissions that can have a material effect 
on our operations.
The AES Corporation is a registered electric holding company under the PUHCA 2005 as enacted as part of 
the EPAct 2005. PUHCA 2005 eliminated many of the restrictions that had been in place under the U.S. Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, while continuing to provide FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced 
access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. PUHCA 2005 also creates additional potential 
challenges and opportunities. By removing some barriers to mergers and other potential combinations, the creation 
of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies is more likel y. These entities may have enhanced 
financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S..
Other parts of the EPAct 2005 allow FERC to remove the PURPA purchase/sale obligations from utilities if 
there are adequate opportunities to sell into competitive markets. FERC has exercised this power with a rebuttable 
presumption that utilities located within the control areas of MISO, PJM, ISO New England, Inc., the New York 
Independent System Operator, Inc., and ERCOT are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a 
certain size. Additionally, FERC has the power to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a 
case-by-case basis. While these changes do not affect existing contracts, certain of our QFs that have had sales 
contracts expire are now facing a more difficult market environment and that is likely to continue for other AES QFs 
with existing contracts that will expire over time.
FERC strongly encourages competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the 
effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop 
demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may 
reduce the value of generation assets. Similarly, FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission 
infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market 
opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.
FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, which concerns 
wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FPA also provides for the 
assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in 
EPAct 2005. As a result, FERC is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established by statute and 
such penalty authority has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. With this 
expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentially have more serious 
consequences than in the past.
Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FERC as the ERO to develop mandatory and 
enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of 
the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability 
standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability 
organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability 
standards, subject to FERC oversight. Violations of NERC reliability standards are subject to FERC's penalty 
authority under the FPA and EPAct 2005.
Our U.S. utility businesses face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The 
regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both Indiana and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and 
facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the 
classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of 
certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. 
These businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Item 1. —Business—US and Utilities 
SBU. 
Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations.
Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state 
and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations 
generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of 
contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation. Failure to comply with such laws and 
regulations or to obtain or comply with any associated environmental permits could result in fines or other sanctions. 66 | 2020 Annual Report
For example, in recent years, the EPA has issued NOVs to a number of coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-
spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The 
EPA has brought suit against and obtained settlements with many companies for allegedly making major 
modifications to a coal-fired generating units without proper permit approvals and without installing best available 
control technology. The primary focus of these NOVs has been emissions of SO 2 and NO x and the EPA has 
imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce such emissions. 
In addition, state regulatory agencies and non-governmental environmental organizations have pursued civil 
lawsuits against power plants in situations that have resulted in judgments and/or settlements requiring the 
installation of expensive pollution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units. 
 Furthermore, Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or 
implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air 
emissions and water discharges. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations 
could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. See Item 1.— Business—
Environmental and Land-Use Regulations .
We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and 
other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force 
us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we 
would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial 
condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected.
Concerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change 
have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses. 
International, federal and various regional and state authorities regulate GHG emissions and have created 
financial incentives to reduce them.  In 2020 , the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses that had total CO 2 
emissions of approximately 47 million metric tonnes, approximately 16 million of which were emitted by our U.S. 
businesses (both figures are ownership adjusted) . The Company uses CO 2 emission estimation methodologies 
supported by "The Greenhouse Gas Protocol" reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation 
plants, CO 2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or 
calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO 2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO 2 emissions 
from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries that are in construction or 
development are approximately 4 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This estimate is based on a number of 
projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant 
efficiency, fuel type, CO 2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and 
development projects. While actual emissions may vary substantially; the projects under construction or 
development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks 
associated with regulation of GHG emissions.
There currently is no U.S. federal legislation imposing mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for CO 2) 
that affects our electric power generation facilities; however, in 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule establishing New 
Source Performance Standards for CO 2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled 
electric utility steam generating units larger than 25 MW and in 2018 proposed revisions to the rule. In 2019, the 
EPA promulgated the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule which establishes heat rate improvement measures as 
the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. On January 19, 2021, the 
D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to EPA the ACE Rule although the parties have the opportunity to request a 
rehearing at the D.C. Circuit or seek a review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The impact of this decision 
and potential new or revised rules from the current Administration remains uncertain. In 2010, the EPA adopted 
regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new and existing sources of GHG emissions to potentially 
obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruled that such permitting would only be required if such sources also must obtain a new source review permit 
for increases in other regulated pollutants.  For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emissions, s ee Item 1. —
Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations— U.S. Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and 
Regulations—Greenhouse Gas Emissions  above. The Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change's Paris Agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average 
temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the 
trend toward efforts to decarbonize the global economy and to further limit GHG emissions. The impact of GHG 
regulation on our operations will depend on a number of factors, including the degree and timing of GHG emissions 67 | 2020 Annual Report
reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the 
price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to 
which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in 
an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to 
recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. The costs of compliance could be substantial. 
Our non-utility, generation subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from CO 2 emissions to contract 
counterparties. Likewise, our utility subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from CO 2 emissions to customers. 
However, there can be no assurance that we will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or 
customers, respectively, or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs 
would not be burdensome and costly.
In addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor 
community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, 
such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our 
operations. See Item 7. —Management's Discussion and Analysis—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Decarbonization 
Initiatives . Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these 
initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as 
quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, 
the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These 
initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded 
costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.
Negative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third 
parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access 
finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets. 
In addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits that were dismissed against the Company because of its 
subsidiaries' GHG emissions. Future similar lawsuits may prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. We 
may also be subject to risks associated with the impact on weather conditions. See Certain of our businesses are 
sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology and Severe weather and natural disasters may present significant 
risks to our business and adversely affect our financial results within this section for more information. If any of the 
foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations, financial condition,cash flows and reputation.
Concerns about data privacy have led to increased regulation and other actions that could 
impact our businesses. 
In the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification 
information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. The theft, damage or 
improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data collected by us can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable 
privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, 
and harm o ur reputation . Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, 
the California Privacy Rights Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the General Data Privacy Law in Brazil or 
other da ta privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights 
violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, 
damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our 
reputation and market position. In addition, any actual or perceived failure on the part of one of our equity affiliates 
could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and prospects. 
Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect us 
We operate in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions and are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the 
U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative 
measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes, our 
effective tax rate or tax payments. The TCJA introduced significant changes to current U.S. federal tax law. These 
changes are complex, and the reaction to the federal tax changes by the individual states is still evolving. Our 
interpretations and assumptions around U.S. tax reform may evolve in future periods, which may materially affect 
our effective tax rate or tax payments. Additionally, President Biden proposed in his campaign platform changes to 
the corporate and U.S. individual tax system, including a possible increase in the corporate tax rate and the rate of 68 | 2020 Annual Report
tax non-U.S. earnings are subject to, that may introduce additional complexity or materially affect our effective tax 
rate or tax payments. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis—Key Trends and Uncertainties .
Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international 
trade is subjected to tax are evolving. The O ECD, in coordination with the G8 and G20, through its initial Base 
Erosion and Profit Shifting project introduced a series of recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, 
or may adopt in the future, as law.  In 2019, the OECD announced an expansion of these efforts in the form of a two-
pillar approach that would create new nexus rules without reference to physical presence (Pillar One) and introduce 
a global minimum tax (Pillar Two). Blueprints for Pillar One and Pillar Two were released in the fourth quarter of 
2020, with a stated goal of bringing the project to a conclusion by mid-2021. 	As these and other tax laws, related 
regulations and double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the 
unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is difficult to assess whether the 
overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash 
flow. Such changes could have a material adverse impact our results of operations.
Risks Related to our Indebtedness and Financial Condition
We have a significant amount of debt.
As of December 31, 2020 , we had approximately $20 billion  of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated 
basis. All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility are unsecured. Most of the 
debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries, however, is secured by substantially all of the assets of those 
subsidiaries. A substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our debt. 
Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of 
collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured 
assets. This level of indebtedness and related security could have other consequences, including:
•making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse 
changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;
•reducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and
•limiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to 
borrow additional funds, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.
The agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not 
prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above 
would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements may be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be 
sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due. In that event, we may not be able to borrow money, 
sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In 
addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial 
condition at that time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates or more onerous covenants 
that restrict our business operations. See Note 11—Debt  included in Item 8. —Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data  for a schedule of our debt maturities.
The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is 
dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries .
The AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. 
Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, 
The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent 
not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash 
to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our subsidiaries face various 
restrictions in their ability to distribute cash. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, 
indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other 
conditions before they may make distributions. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may also 
limit dividend distributions. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds as a 
result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Our subsidiaries 69 | 2020 Annual Report
are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed The AES Corporation's 
indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to 
make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. 
Existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect us.
We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects through non-recourse debt or "non-recourse 
financing" that requires the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of 
the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of 
that project subsidiary or affiliate. As of December 31, 2020 , we had approximately $20 billion  of outstanding 
indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $3.4 billion  was recourse debt of the Parent 
Company and approximately $16.4 billion  was non-recourse debt. In some non-recourse financings, the Parent 
Company has explicitly agreed, in the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit 
reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent 
liabilities, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events.
Certain of our subsidiaries are in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The 
total debt classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such defaults was $276 million  as of 
December 31, 2020 . While the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to 
the Parent Company, such defaults under non-recourse financings can: 
•reduce the Parent Company's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other 
sources of cash because a subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent 
Company during the pendency of any default;
•trigger The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or 
other credit support provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•trigger defaults in the Parent Company's outstanding debt. For example, The AES Corporation's revolving 
credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events 
involving material subsidiaries and  relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material 
subsidiaries  or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary;  or
•result in foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse financings, resulting in write-
downs of assets and eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.
None of the projects that are in default are owned by subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, meet 
the applicable standard of materiality in The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility or other debt agreements to 
trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of 
distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other changes to our financial position and results of 
operations, one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable 
standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and 
possible acceleration of Parent Company indebtedness.
The AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.
The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: principal repayments of debt, interest, dividends on our 
common stock, acquisitions, construction and other project commitments, other equity commitments (including 
business development investments); equity repurchases; taxes and Parent Company overhead costs. Our principal 
sources of liquidity are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, proceeds from financings at the 
Parent Company, and proceeds from asset sales. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis —Capital 
Resources and Liquidity . We believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations for the foreseeable 
future, based on a number of material assumptions about access the capital or commercial lending markets, the 
operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of 
our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions; however, there can be no assurance that these sources 
will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. In addition, 
our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay our debt obligations at maturity and we may have to refinance such 
obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on acceptable 
terms.
Our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to raise capital on favorable terms.
We rely on the capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash 70 | 2020 Annual Report
flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital 
are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic and capital 
market conditions; the availability of bank credit; the availability of tax equity partners; the financial condition, 
performance and prospects of AES as well as our competitors; and changes in tax and securities laws. Should 
access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or cease further investments, including the 
expansion or improvement of existing facilities, any of which would affect our future growth.
A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely 
affect our access to the capital markets, interest expense, liquidity or cash flow.
If any of the credit ratings of the The AES Corporation and its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability 
to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. Furthermore, 
counterparties may no longer be willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to 
provide credit support. Accordingly, we may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of 
credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation, which reduces our 
available credit. There can be no assurance that counterparties will accept such guarantees or other assurances.
The market price of our common stock may be volatile.
The market price and trading volumes of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to factors 
including general economic conditions, conditions in our industry and our markets, environmental and economic 
developments, and general credit and capital markets conditions, as well as developments specific to us, including 
risks described in this section, failing to meet our publicly announced guidance or key trends and other matters 
described in Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long- and short-
term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in 
Item 1 —Business  of this Form 10-K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the 
project's related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, 
in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land 
interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The 
Company has accrued for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount 
of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and 
taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate 
outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably possible, however, that some matters could be decided 
unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that 
could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2020 .
In December 2001, Grid Corporation of Odisha (“GRIDCO”) served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (“AES ODPL”), 
and Jyoti Structures (“Jyoti”) pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between GRIDCO, the Company, 
AES ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (“CESCO”), an affiliate of the Company. 
In the arbitration, GRIDCO asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Company's 
indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCO's 
financial obligations to GRIDCO. GRIDCO appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus 
undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by GRIDCO. The Company 
counterclaimed against GRIDCO for damages. In June 2007, a 2-to-1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its 
award rejecting GRIDCO's claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had 
any liability to GRIDCO. The respondents' counterclaims were also rejected. A majority of the tribunal later awarded 
the respondents, including the Company, some of their costs relating to the arbitration. GRIDCO filed challenges of 
the tribunal's awards with the local Indian court. GRIDCO's challenge of the costs award has been dismissed by the 71 | 2020 Annual Report
court, but its challenge of the liability award remains pending. A hearing on the liability award has not taken place to 
date. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself 
vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.
Pursuant to their environmental audit, AES Sul and AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote 
waste and other contaminants at a pole factory that AES Florestal had been operating. The conclusion of the audit 
was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia (“CEEE”), had been using those 
contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AES Florestal 
communicated with Brazilian authorities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. 
In March 2008, the State Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil action against AES Sul, 
AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an order requiring the companies to mitigate the contaminated area located on 
the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximately R$6 million  ($1 million ). In October 
2011, the State Attorney filed a request for an injunction ordering the defendant companies to contain and remove 
the contamination immediately. The court granted injunctive relief on October 18, 2011, but determined that only 
CEEE was required to perform the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began the removal work in compliance with 
the injunction. The case is now awaiting judgment. The removal and remediation costs are estimated to be 
approximately R$10 million  to R$41 million  ($2 million  to $8 million ), and there could be additional costs which 
cannot be estimated at this time. In June 2016, the Company sold AES Sul to CPFL Energia S.A. and as part of the 
sale, AES Guaiba, a holding company of AES Sul, retained the potential liability relating to this matter. The 
Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself 
vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.
In February 2017, the EPA issued a NOV for DPL Stuart Station, alleging violations of opacity in 2016. On May 
31, 2018, Stuart Station was retired, and on December 20, 2019, it was transferred to an unaffiliated third-party 
purchaser, along with the associated environmental liabilities . 
In October 2015, IPL received a similar NOV alleging violations at Petersburg Station. In addition, in February 
2016, IPL received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of NSR and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, 
and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. On August 31, 2020, IPL reached a settlement with the EPA, 
the DOJ and IDEM, resolving these purported violations of the CAA at Petersburg Station. The settlement 
agreement, in the form of a proposed judicial consent decree, includes, among other items, the following 
requirements: annual caps on NO x and SO 2 emissions and more stringent emissions limits than IPL's current Title V 
air permit; payment of civil penalties totaling $1.5 million; a $5 million environmental mitigation project consisting of 
the construction and operation of a new, non-emitting source of generation at the site; expenditure of $0.3 million on 
a state-only environmentally beneficial project to preserve local, ecologically-significant lands; and retirement of 
Units 1 and 2 prior to July 1, 2023. If IPL does not meet the retirement obligation, it must install a Selective Non-
Catalytic Reduction System on Unit 4. The proposed Consent Decree is subject to final review and approval by the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, following a 30-day public comment period, which began upon 
publication in the Federal Register. On January 14, 2021, the United States and Indiana, on behalf of EPA and 
IDEM, respectively, filed a motion asking the court to enter the proposed Consent Decree, along with the United 
States’ response to the adverse public comments on the proposed settlements.
In September 2015, AES Southland Development, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC filed a lawsuit against 
the California Coastal Commission (the “CCC”) over the CCC's determination that the site of AES Redondo Beach 
included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictional wetlands. The CCC has asserted that AES Redondo Beach 
has improperly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands in violation of the California 
Coastal Act and Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program. Potential outcomes of the CCC determination could 
include an order requiring AES Redondo Beach to perform a restoration and/or pay fines or penalties. AES 
Redondo Beach believes that it has meritorious arguments concerning the underlying CCC determination, but there 
can be no assurances that it will be successful. On March 27, 2020, AES Redondo Beach, LLC sold the site to an 
unaffiliated third-party purchaser that assumed the obligations contained within these proceedings. On May 26, 
2020, CCC staff sent AES a Notice of Violation (NOV) directing AES to submit a Coastal Development Permit 
(“CDP”) application for the removal of the water pumps within the alleged wetlands. AES has submitted the CDP to 
the permitting authority, the City of Redondo Beach (“the City”), with respect to AES’s plans to disable or remove the 
pumps. The NOV also directed AES to submit technical analysis regarding additional water pumps located within 
onsite electrical vaults and a CDP application for their continued operation. AES has responded to the CCC, 
providing the requested analysis and seeking further discussion with the agency regarding the CDP. On October 14, 
2020, the City deemed the CDP application to be complete and indicated a public hearing will be required, at which 72 | 2020 Annual Report
time AES must present additional information and analysis on the pumps within the alleged wetlands and the onsite 
electrical vaults.
In January 2017, the Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente (“SMA”) issued a Formulation of Charges 
asserting that Alto Maipo is in violation of certain conditions of the Environmental Approval Resolution (“RCA”) 
governing the construction of Alto Maipo’s hydropower project, for, among other things, operating vehicles at 
unauthorized times and failing to mitigate the impact of water infiltration during tunnel construction (“Infiltration 
Water”). In February 2017, Alto Maipo submitted a compliance plan (“Compliance Plan”) to the SMA which, if 
approved by the agency, would resolve the matter without materially impacting construction of the project. In April 
2018, the SMA approved the Compliance Plan (“April 2018 Approval”). Among other things, the Compliance Plan as 
approved by the SMA requires Alto Maipo to obtain from the Environmental Evaluation Service (“SEA”) a definitive 
interpretation of the RCA’s provisions concerning the authorized times to operate certain vehicles. In addition, Alto 
Maipo must obtain the SEA’s final approval concerning the control, discharge, and treatment of Infiltration Water. 
Alto Maipo continues to seek the relevant final approvals from the SEA. A number of lawsuits have been filed in 
relation to the April 2018 Approval, some of which are still pending. To date, none of the lawsuits have negatively 
impacted the April 2018 Approval or the construction of the project. If Alto Maipo complies with the requirements of 
the Compliance Plan, and if the above-referenced lawsuits are dismissed, the Formulation of Charges will be 
discharged without penalty. Otherwise, Alto Maipo could be subject to penalties, and the construction of the project 
could be negatively impacted. Alto Maipo will pursue its interests vigorously in these matters; however, there can be 
no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.
In June 2017, Alto Maipo terminated one of its contractors, Constructora Nuevo Maipo S.A. (“CNM”), given 
CNM’s stoppage of tunneling works, its failure to produce a completion plan, and its other breaches of contract. 
Also, Alto Maipo drew $73 million under letters of credit (“LC Funds”) in connection with its termination of CNM. Alto 
Maipo is pursuing arbitration against CNM to recover excess completion costs and other damages totaling at least 
$236 million (net of the LC Funds) relating to CNM’s breaches (“First Arbitration”). CNM denies liability and seeks a 
declaration that its termination was wrongful, damages that it alleges result from that termination, and other relief. 
CNM alleges that it is entitled to damages ranging from $70 million to $170 million (which include the LC Funds) 
plus interest and costs, based on various scenarios. Alto Maipo has contested these submissions. The evidentiary 
hearing in the First Arbitration took place May 20-31, 2019, and closing arguments were heard June 9-10, 2020. 
The parties are now awaiting the Tribunal’s decision in the First Arbitration. Also, in August 2018, CNM purported to 
initiate a separate arbitration against AES Gener and the Company (“Second Arbitration”). In the Second Arbitration, 
CNM seeks to pierce Alto Maipo’s corporate veil and appears to seek an award holding AES Gener and the 
Company jointly and severally liable to pay any alleged net amounts that are found to be due to CNM in the First 
Arbitration or otherwise. The Second Arbitration has been consolidated into the First Arbitration. The arbitral tribunal 
has bifurcated the Second Arbitration to determine in the first instance the jurisdictional objections raised by AES 
Gener and the Company to CNM’s piercing claims. The hearing on the jurisdictional objections, which was 
previously scheduled for October 2020, has been postponed to a date to be determined. Each of Alto Maipo, AES 
Gener, and the Company believe s it has meritorious claims and/or defenses and will pursue its interests vigorously; 
however, there can be no assurances that each will be successful in its efforts.
In October 2017, the Maritime Prosecution Office from Valparaíso issued a ruling alleging responsibility by AES 
Gener for the presence of coal waste on Ventanas beach, and proposed a fine before the Maritime Governor, of 
approximately $380,000. AES Gener submitted its statement of defense, denying the allegations. An evidentiary 
stage was concluded and then re-opened by order of the Maritime Governor on February 5, 2019 to allow AES 
Gener an opportunity  to present reports and other evidence to challenge the grounds of the ruling . AES Gener has 
completed its presentation of evidence and awaits the Maritime Prosecution Office’s decision of the case. AES 
Gener believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations; however, there are no assurances that it will be 
successful in defending this action.
In December 2018, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto 
Rico, and three other AES affiliates. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 100 Dominican claimants, 
living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 
2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands $476 million 
in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged 
injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for 
damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. The relevant AES companies believe that they have 
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; 
however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.73 | 2020 Annual Report
In February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES 
Puerto Rico, two other AES affiliates, and an unaffiliated company and its principal. The lawsuit purports to be 
brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to 
CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs 
caused personal injuries and deaths and demands $900 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, 
or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the 
lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In 
August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, the case was transferred to a different civil court. The 
relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will 
defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful 
in their efforts.
In October 2019, the Superintendency of the Environment (the "SMA") notified AES Gener of certain alleged 
breaches associated with the environmental permit of the Ventanas Complex, initiating a sanctioning process 
through Exempt Resolution N° 1 / ROL D-129-2019. The alleged charges include exceeding generation limits, failing 
to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality, exceeding limits on discharges to the sea, and exceeding 
noise limits. As the charges are currently classified, the maximum fine is approximately $6.5 million. On October 14, 
2019, the SMA notified AES Gener of other alleged breaches at the Guacolda Complex under Exempt Resolution N
° 1 / ROL D-146-2019. These allegations include failure to comply with all measures to mitigate atmospheric 
emissions, failure to comply with mitigation measures to avoid solid fuel discharges to the sea, failure to perform 
temperature monitoring in intake and water discharge at Unit 3, and a one-day exceedance of the seawater 
discharge limits. As the Guacolda charges are currently classified, the maximum fine is approximately $4 million. 
For each complex, additional fines are possible if the SMA determines that non-compliance resulted in an economic 
benefit. AES Gener has submitted proposed "Compliance Programs" to the SMA for the Ventanas Complex and the 
Guacolda Complex, respectively. In August 2020, the Compliance Program for Guacolda Complex was approved by 
the SMA. Upon successful execution of the Compliance Program, the process is expected to conclude without 
sanctions and to not generate further actions. If the Ventanas Complex submission is approved by the SMA and 
satisfactorily fulfilled by AES Gener, the process is also expected to conclude without sanctions and to not generate 
further action.
In March 2020, Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electricidad (“CFE”) served an arbitration demand upon AES 
Mérida III. CFE makes allegations that AES Mérida III is in breach of its obligations under a power and capacity 
purchase agreement ("Contract") between the two parties, which allegations relate to CFE’s own failure to provide 
fuel within the specifications of the Contract. CFE seeks to recover approximately $190 million in payments made to 
AES Merida under the Contract as well as approximately $431 million in alleged damages for having to acquire 
power from alternative sources in the Yucatan Peninsula. AES Mérida has filed an answer denying liability to CFE 
and asserting a counterclaim for damages due to CFE’s breach of its obligations. The parties submitted their 
respective initial briefs and supporting evidence in December 2020. After additional briefing, the evidentiary hearing 
will take place in November 2021. AES Mérida believes that it has meritorious defenses and claims and will assert 
them vigorously in the arbitration; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
Executive Summary 
In 20 20, AES delivered on or exceeded all strategic and financial objectives. We completed construction of 2.3 
GW of new projects and signed long-term PPAs for 3 GW of renewable capacity. Fluence, our joint venture with 
Siemens, maintained its leading global market share with 1 GW of projects delivered or awarded in 2020. Finally, 
following our efforts to reduce recourse debt, our Parent Company's credit rating was upgraded to investment grade 
by S&P. See Overview of our Strategy  included in Item 1.— Business  of this Form 10-K for further information.
Compared with last year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  decreased  $0.39 , from $0.45  
to $0.06 . This decrease reflects higher impairments and losses on sales in the current period, lower contributions 
from DP&L primarily driven by lower regulated rates as a result of the changes in the ESP, lower demand at IPL and 
DP&L due to milder weather, lower contributions from Colombia due to drier hydrology and lower generation due to 
a life extension project at Chivor, and prior year net insurance recoveries; partially offset by lower income tax 
expense, and higher contributions from Chile due to net gains from early contract terminations at Angamos and a 
positive impact due to incremental capitalized interest, from Brazil due  to a favorable revision to the GSF liability, 
from Panama due to higher availability and improved hydrology, and in the U.S. due to commencement of 
operations of the Southland Energy CCGTs and a gain on sale of land.
Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased  $0.08 , from $1.36  to $1.44 , mainly due to higher availability 
and improved hydrology in Panama, commencement of operations of the Southland Energy CCGTs and a gain on 
sale of land in the U.S., a favorable revision to the GSF liability in Brazil,  a lower adjusted tax rate, and a positive 
impact in Chile due to incremental capitalized interest; partially offset by lower contributions from our utilities in the 
U.S. primarily driven by lower regulated rates as a result of the changes in DP&L's ESP and lower demand due to 
milder weather, lower contributions from Colombia due to drier hydrology and lower generation due to a life 
extension project at Chivor, and prior year net insurance recoveries.78 | 2020 Annual Report

Components of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin — Revenue includes revenue earned from the 
sale of energy from our utilities and the production and sale of energy from our generation plants, which are 
classified as regulated and non-regulated, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue 
also includes the gains or losses on derivatives associated with the sale of electricity. 
Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples 
include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, 
bad debt expense and recoveries, and general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs 
directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on 
derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the 
purchase of electricity or fuel.
Operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales. 79 | 2020 Annual Report

Consolidated Revenue  — Revenue decreased  $529 million , or 5%, in 2020  compared to 2019 . Excluding the 
unfavorable  FX impact of $182 million , primarily in South America, this decrease  was driven by: 
•$229 million in Eurasia driven by the sale of the Northern Ireland businesses in June 2019 and lower 
generation in Vietnam;
•$140 million in US and Utilities mainly driven by a decrease in energy pass-through rates and lower demand 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic in El Salvador, lower regulated rates as a result of the changes in DP&L's 
ESP, lower retail sales demand at IPL and DPL primarily due to milder weather and COVID-19 pandemic 
impacts, and decreased capacity sales, at Southland due to unit retirements, and at DPL due to the sale and 
closure of generation facilities. These decreases were partially offset by increased capacity sales at 
Southland Energy due to the commencement of the PPAs; and
•$88 million in MCAC mainly driven by lower generation and volume pass-through fuel revenue in Mexico, the 
disconnection of the Estrella del Mar I power barge from the grid in Panama, and lower market prices, spot 
sales and demand in both the Dominican Republic  and at the Colon combined cycle facility in Panama. 
These decreases were partially offset by higher LNG sales in the Dominican Republic, driven by the Eastern 
Pipeline COD  in 2020.
These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of $115 million in South America driven by 
revenue recognized at Angamos for the early termination of contracts with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence 
and recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile, partially offset by drier hydrology and lower 
generation in Colombia due to a life extension project being performed at the Chivor hydro plant, lower pass-
through coal prices, spot prices, and lower generation in Chile, and lower energy and capacity prices (Resolution 
31/2020) in Argentina.80 | 2020 Annual Report

Consolidated Operating Margin  — Operating margin increased  $344 million , or 15%, in 2020  compared to 
2019 . Excluding the unfavorable  impact of FX of $50 million , primarily in South America, this increase  was driven 
by:
•$423 million  in South America primarily due to the drivers discussed above, as well as a $184 million 
favorable revision to the GSF liability at Tietê related to the passage of a regulation providing concession 
extensions to hydro plants as compensation for prior period non-hydrological risk charges incorrectly 
assessed by the regulator ; and
•$72 million in MCAC mostly due to higher availability at Changuinola due to the tunnel lining upgrade in 
2019, improved hydrology in Panama, and higher LNG sales in the Dominican Republic, partially offset by 
prior year insurance recoveries associated with the lightning incident at the Andres facility in 2018, current 
year outage due to Andres steam turbine failure, and the disconnection of the Estrella del Mar I power barge 
from the grid in Panama.
These favorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease of $116 million in US and Utilities mostly due to 
lower regulated rates as a result of the changes in DP&L's ESP, lower retail sales demand at DPL and IPL primarily 
due to milder weather and COVID-19 pandemic impacts, lower capacity sales due to the retirement of units at 
Southland, a favorable revision to the ARO at DPL, and cost recoveries from DPL's joint owners of Stuart and Killen 
in 2019, partially offset by increased capacity sales at Southland Energy due to the commencement of the PPAs, 
and lower depreciation expense at Southland due to the extension of the water board permits.

Consolidated Revenue  — Revenue decreased  $547 million , or 5%, in 2019  compared to 2018 . Excluding the 
unfavorable  FX impact of $133 million , primarily in South America, this decrease was driven by: 
•$229 million in South America primarily driven by lower generation and prices in Argentina and lower contract 
sales and generation in Chile;81 | 2020 Annual Report
•$173 million in Eurasia primarily due to the sales of the Masinloc power plant in March 2018 and the 
Northern Ireland businesses in June 2019; and
•$172 million in US and Utilities primarily driven by the closure of generation facilities at DPL in the first half of 
2018 and Shady Point in May 2019, and lower energy prices and sales due to higher temperatures and other 
favorable market conditions present in 2018 as compared to 2019 at Southland, partially offset by price 
increases due to the 2018 rate orders at IPL and DPL and an increase in energy pass-through costs in El 
Salvador.
These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of $156 million in MCAC driven by the 
commencement of operations at the Colon combined cycle facility in Panama in September 2018.

Consolidated Operating Margin  — Operating margin decreased  $224 million , or 9%, in 2019  compared to 
2018 . Excluding the unfavorable  impact of FX of $46 million , primarily in South America, this decrease was driven 
by:
•$107 million in South America primarily due to the drivers discussed above; 
•$46 million in MCAC due to the outage at Changuinola as a result of upgrading the tunnel lining and lower 
hydrology in Panama as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the business interruption insurance 
recoveries at the Andres facility in Dominican Republic, higher contract sales at Panama, and the 
commencement of operations at the Colon combined cycle facility in Panama; and
•$31 million in Eurasia primarily due to the drivers discussed above, partially offset by lower depreciation at 
the Jordan plants due to their classification as held-for-sale.
These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a $21 million increase in US and Utilities mostly driven by 
the 2018 rate orders at IPL and DPL, partially offset by the lost margin from the sale and closure of generation 
facilities at Shady Point and DPL, and increased rock ash disposal at Puerto Rico.

Consolidated Results of Operations — Other
General and administrative expenses  
General and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, 
executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, as well as global development 
costs.
General and administrative expenses decreased  $31 million , or 16%, to $165 million  for 2020  compared to 
$196 million  for 2019 , primarily due to  a higher reallocation of information technology costs  to the SBUs and lower 
professional fees, partially offset by higher development costs.
General and administrative expenses increased  $4 million , or 2%, to $196 million  for 2019  compared to $192 
million  for 2018 , with no material drivers.82 | 2020 Annual Report
Interest expense  
Interest expense decreased  $12 million , or 1%, to $1,038 million  for 2020 , compared to $1,050 million  for 2019  
primarily due to incremental capitalized interest in Chile and lower interest rates due to refinancing at the Parent 
Company, partially offset by lower capitalized interest due to the commencement of operations at the Alamitos and 
Huntington Beach facilities in February 2020.
Interest expense decreased  $6 million , or 1%, to $1,050 million  for 2019 , compared to $1,056 million  for 2018  
primarily due to the debt refinancing at the Parent Company and DPL , and favorable foreign currency translation at 
AES Brasil, partially offset by lower capitalized interest due to the commencement of operations at Colon in 
September 2018, a decrease in AFUDC for the Eagle Valley CCGT project at IPL, and the loss of hedge accounting 
at Alto Maipo in 2018, which resulted in favorable unrealized mark-to-market adjustments recognized within interest 
expense.
Interest income  
Interest income decreased  $50 million , or 16%, to $268 million  for 2020 , compared to $318 million  for 2019  
primarily  to the decrease of the LIBOR rate on receivables in Argentina, a lower loan receivable balance at Mong 
Duong, and a lower average interest rate at AES Brasil.
Interest income increased  $8 million , or 3%, to $318 million  for 2019 , compared to $310 million  for 2018  
primarily in South America driven by a higher average interest rate on CAMMESA receivables.
Loss on extinguishment of debt  
Loss on extinguishment of debt increased  $17 million , or 10%, to $186 million  for 2020 , compared to $169 
million  for 2019 . This increase  was primarily due to losses of $145 million  and $34 million  at the Parent Company 
and DPL, respectively, resulting from the redemption of senior notes and a $16 million  loss resulting from the 
Panama refinancing in 2020. These increases were partially offset by losses of $45 million  at DPL, $31 million  at 
Mong Duong, $29 million  at Gener, $28 million  at Colon, and $24 million  at Cochrane in 2019 resulting from the 
redemption or refinancing of senior notes.
Loss on extinguishment of debt decreased  $19 million , or 10% to $169 million  for 2019 , compared to $188 
million  for 2018 . This decrease  was primarily due to losses of $171 million  at the Parent Company resulting from the 
redemption of senior notes in 2018 compared to the 2019 losses discussed above. 
See Note 11—Debt  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for 
further information.
Other income  
Other income decreased  $70 million , or 48%, to $75 million  for 2020 , compared to $145 million  for 2019  
primarily due to  the prior year gains on insurance recoveries associated with property damage at the Andres facility 
and upgrading the tunnel lining at Changuinola, partially offset by the current year gain on sale of Redondo Beach 
land at Southland.
Other income increased  $73 million  to $145 million  for 2019 , compared to $72 million  for 2018  primarily due to 
gains on insurance recoveries associated with property damage at the Andres facility and upgrading the tunnel 
lining at Changuinola. These increases were partially offset by a gain on remeasurement of contingent liabilities for 
projects in Hawaii in 2018.
Other expense  
Other expense decreased  $27 million , or 34%, to $53 million  for 2020 , compared to $80 million  for 2019  
primarily due to  prior year losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases at Distributed Energy, the prior 
year loss on disposal of assets at Changuinola associated with upgrading the tunnel lining, and lower defined 
benefit plan costs at IPL in 2020, partially offset by a loss on sale of  Stabilization Fund receivables in Chile and 
compliance with an arbitration decision in 2020.
Other expense increased  $22 million , or 38% to $80 million  for 2019 , compared to $58 million  for 2018  
primarily due to losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases at Distributed Energy and the loss on 
disposal of assets at Changuinola associated with upgrading the tunnel lining in 2019. This was partially offset by 83 | 2020 Annual Report
the loss on disposal of assets resulting from damage associated with a lightning incident at the Andres facility in the 
Dominican Republic in 2018. 
See Note 21—Other Income and Expense  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  
of this Form 10-K for further information.
Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests  
Loss on disposal and sale of business interests was $95 million  for 2020 , primarily due to the loss on sale of 
Uruguaiana and the loss on the settlement of the arbitration related to the sale of Kazakhstan HPPs , partially offset 
by the gain on sale of OPGC;  as compared to a gain of $28 million  for 2019  primarily due to the gain on sale of a 
portion of our interest in sPower's operating assets, the gain on the merger of Simple Energy to form Uplight, and 
the gain on transfer of Stuart and Killen, partially offset by the loss on sale of Kilroot and Ballylumford.
Gain on disposal and sale of business interests decreased  to $28 million  for 2019  as compared to $984 million  
for 2018 , primarily due to the 2018 gains on sale of Masinloc of $772 million , CTNG of $126 million , and Electrica 
Santiago of $70 million .
See Note 25—Held-For-Sale and Dispositions  and Note 8—Investments in and Advances to Affiliates  included 
in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for further information.
Asset impairment expense  
Asset impairment expense increased  $679 million  to $864 million  for 2020 , compared to $185 million  for 2019 . 
This increase was primarily driven by a $781 million impairment related to certain coal-fired plants at AES Gener 
and a $30 million impairment of the Estrella del Mar I power barge in Panama, compared to a $115 million prior year 
impairment at Kilroot and Ballylumford upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria in 2019.
Asset impairment expense decreased  $23 million , or 11%, to $185 million  for 2019 , compared to $208 million  
for 2018 . This decrease was primarily driven by $115 million  as a result of an impairment analysis performed at 
Kilroot and Ballylumford upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria in 2019 and $60 million  at Hawaii due to a decrease 
in the economic useful life of the coal-fired asset, compared to 2018 impairments of $157 million  at Shady Point due 
to an unfavorable economic outlook creating uncertainty around future cash flows and $37 million  at Nejapa due to 
the landfill owner's failure to perform improvements necessary to continue extracting gas.

The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses  of $72 million  for the year ended December 
31, 2018 , primarily due to the devaluation of long-term receivables denominated in Argentine pesos, partially offset 
by gains at the Parent Company related to foreign currency derivatives.
Other non-operating expense  
Other non-operating expense was $202 million  and $92 million  in 2020  and 2019 , respectively, due to the 
other-than-temporary impairment of the OPGC equity method investment. In December 2019, an other-than-
temporary impairment of $92 million  was identified at OPGC primarily due to the estimated market value of the 
Company's investment and other negative developments impacting future expected cash flows at the investee . In 
March 2020, the Company recognized an additional $43 million  other-than-temporary impairment due to the 
economic slowdown. In June 2020, the Company agreed to sell its entire stake in the OPGC investment, resulting in 
an other-than-temporary impairment of $158 million .
Other non-operating expense was $147 million  in 2018  primarily due to the $144 million  other-than-temporary 
impairment of the Guacolda equity method investment as a result of increased renewable generation in Chile 
lowering energy prices and impacting the ability of Guacolda to re-contract its existing PPAs after they expire.
See Note 8—Investments in and Advances to Affiliates  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for further information.
Income tax expense  
Income tax expense decreased  $136 million  to $216 million  in 2020  as compared to $352 million  for 2019 . The 
Company's effective tax rates were 44% and 35% for the years ended December 31, 2020  and 2019 .
The net increase in the 2020 effective tax rate was primarily due to the 2020 impacts of the other-than-
temporary impairment of the OPGC equity method investment and the loss on sale of the Company’s entire interest 
in AES Uruguaiana, partially offset by the recognition of a federal ITC for the Na Pua Makani wind facility in Hawaii. 
Further, the 2019 rate was impacted by the items described below. See Note 25—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions  
included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for details of the sales.
Income tax expense decreased  $356 million  to $352 million  in 2019  as compared to $708 million  for 2018 . The 
Company's effective tax rate was 35% for both years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018 .
The 2019 effective tax rate was impacted by the nondeductible losses on the sale of the Company's entire 
100%  interest in the Kilroot coal and oil-fired plant and energy storage facility and the Ballylumford gas-fired plant in 
the United Kingdom and associated asset impairments. Further impacting the 2019 effective tax rate were the 
effects of the Argentine peso devaluation to tax expense, as well as to pretax income for nondeductible unrealized 
losses on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in Argentina. The 2018 effective tax rate 
was impacted by the increase in the Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118 ("SAB 118") adjustment with respect to the 
estimate of the one-time transition tax and deferred tax remeasurement under the TCJA. This impact was partially 
offset by the impact of the sale of the Company’s entire 51% equity interest in Masinloc. See Note 25—Held-for-
Sale and Dispositions  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for 
details of the sales.
Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed 
at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate. Foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the U.S. corporate 
rate of 21% and are also subject to current U.S. taxation under the GILTI rules introduced by the TCJA. A future 
proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions 
could impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries 
as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. See Note 23—Income 
Taxes  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for addition information 
regarding these reduced rates.
Net equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates  
Net equity in losses of affiliates decreased  $49 million , or 28%, to $123 million  in 2020 , compared to $172 
million  in 2019 . This was primarily driven by a $31 million  increase in earnings due to lower long-lived asset 
impairments at Guacolda, Gener's 50%-owned equity affiliate, during 2020 as compared to 2019 .
Net equity in earnings of affiliates decreased  $211 million  to losses of $172 million  in 2019 , compared to 
earnings of $39 million  in 2018 . This was primarily driven by a $158 million  decrease in earnings due to a long-lived 85 | 2020 Annual Report
asset impairment at Guacolda, a $19 million  decrease in earnings at OPGC due to a contract termination charge, 
and a $20 million  decrease in earnings at sPower due to the impairment of certain development projects.
See Note 8—Investments In and Advances to Affiliates  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for further information.
Net income from discontinued operations
Net income from discontinued operations was $3 million  and $1 million  for the years ended December 31, 
2020  and 2019 , respectively, with no material drivers. 
Net income from discontinued operations was $216 million  for the year ended December 31, 2018  primarily 
due to the after-tax gain on sale of Eletropaulo of $199 million  recognized in the second quarter of 2018 and the 
recognition of a $26 million  deferred gain upon liquidation of Borsod in October 2018.
See Note 24—Discontinued Operations  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of 
this Form 10-K for further information.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased  $69 million , 
or 39%, to $106 million  in 2020 , compared to $175 million  in 2019 . This decrease  was primarily due to:
•Lower earnings in Chile due to long-lived asset impairments at Gener, partially offset by net gains from early 
contract terminations at Angamos and lower interest expense due to incremental capitalized interest; 
•Lower earnings in Colombia due to drier hydrology and a life extension project at the Chivor hydroelectric 
plant; 
•Prior year insurance recoveries net of outages at Andres; and
•HLBV allocation of losses to noncontrolling interests at Distributed Energy.
These increases were partially offset by:
•Higher earnings in Brazil due to the favorable revision of the GSF liability; and
•Prior year losses on extinguishment of debt at Mong Duong and Colon.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased  $187 
million , or 52%, to $175 million  in 2019 , compared to $362 million  in 2018 . This decrease  was primarily due to:
•Gains on sales of Electrica Santiago and CTNG in Chile in 2018;
•Lower earnings in Chile in 2019 primarily due to long-lived asset impairment at Guacolda, losses on 
extinguishment of debt, and lower contracted energy sales and prices;
•HLBV allocation of losses to noncontrolling interests at Distributed Energy as a result of renewable projects 
reaching COD in 2019; and
•Lower earnings in Panama in 2019 primarily due to lower hydrology and the outage at Changuinola as a 
result of upgrading the tunnel lining.
These decreases were partially offset by:
•Other-than-temporary impairment of Guacolda in 2018.
Net income attributable to The AES Corporation
Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased  $257 million , or 85%, to $46 million  in 2020 , 
compared to $303 million  in 2019 . This decrease  was primarily due to:
•Long-lived asset impairments at Gener and Panama;
•Net impact of current  and prior year other-than-temporary impairments of OPGC;
•Higher losses on extinguishment of debt in the current year, primarily due to major refinancings at the 
Parent Company;
•Lower margins at our US and Utilities SBU;86 | 2020 Annual Report
•Losses on sale of Uruguaiana and the Kazakhstan HPPs as a result of the final arbitration decision; and
•Prior year net insurance recoveries at Andres.
These decreases were partially offset by:
•Prior year long-lived asset impairments at Kilroot and Ballylumford ;
•Net impact of current and prior year long-lived asset impairments at Guacolda;
•Prior year unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in Argentina;
•Higher margins at our South America and MCAC SBUs;
•Lower income tax expense;
•Lower interest expense due to incremental capitalized interest in Chile ; and
•Gain on sale of land held by AES Redondo Beach at Southland.
Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased  $900 million , or 75% to $303 million  in 2019 , 
compared to $1,203 million  in 2018 . This decrease  was primarily due to:
•Gains on the sales of Masinloc, Eletropaulo (reflected within discontinued operations), CTNG and Electrica 
Santiago in 2018, net of tax;
•Long-lived asset impairments at Guacolda, Hawaii, Kilroot and Ballylumford, and other-than-temporary 
impairment at OPGC in 2019;
•Loss on sale at Kilroot and Ballylumford in 2019;
•Losses on extinguishment of debt at DPL, AES Gener, Mong Duong, and Colon in 2019;
•Losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases at Distributed Energy in 2019;
•The impact of sold businesses in our Eurasia SBU;
•Lower margins at Argentina and Chile in 2019, primarily due to lower generation; and
•Lower margins at Changuinola in 2019, driven by the outage as a result of upgrading the tunnel lining and 
lower hydrology in Panama.
These decreases were partially offset by:
•Income tax expense in 2018 to finalize the initial impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017;
•Loss on extinguishment of debt at the Parent Company in 2018;
•Long-lived asset impairments at Shady Point and Nejapa, and other-than-temporary impairment at 
Guacolda in 2018;
•Gains on insurance proceeds in 2019, associated with the lightning incident at the Andres facility in 2018 
and the Changuinola tunnel leak;
•Gain on sale of a portion of our interest in sPower’s operating assets and gain on disposal of Stuart and 
Killen at DPL in 2019; and
•Higher earnings at our US and Utilities SBU in 2019, primarily as a result of renewable projects that came 
online.
SBU Performance Analysis
Segments

Salvador); South America  (Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil); MCAC  (Mexico, Central America and the 
Caribbean); and Eurasia (Europe and Asia).
Non-GAAP Measures
Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are 
used by management and external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements such as investors, industry 
analysts and lenders. 87 | 2020 Annual Report
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company changed the definitions of Adjusted Operating Margin, 
Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS to exclude net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America 
SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. We believe the 
inclusion of the effects of this non-recurring transaction would result in a lack of comparability in our results of 
operations and would distort the metrics that our investors use to measure us.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company changed the definitions of Adjusted PTC and Adjusted 
EPS to exclude gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases. We believe these transactions 
are economically similar to sales of business interests and excluding these gains or losses better reflects the 
underlying business performance of the Company.
Adjusted Operating Margin 
We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Operating Margin, adjusted for the impact of NCI, excluding (a) 
unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions; (b) benefits and costs associated with dispositions and 
acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; (c) costs directly associated with a major 
restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; 
and (d) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract 
terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. The allocation of HLBV earnings to noncontrolling interests 
is not adjusted out of Adjusted Operating Margin. See Review of Consolidated Results of Operations  for definitions 
of Operating Margin and cost of sales. 
The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted Operating Margin is Operating Margin . We believe that 
Adjusted Operating Margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. Factors in this 
determination include the impact of NCI, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly 
owned by the Company, as well as the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions 
and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests. Adjusted Operating Margin should not be 
construed as an alternative to Operating Margin, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted PTC 
We define Adjusted PTC as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation 
excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to  (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative 
transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and 
costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains 
and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and 
costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, 
but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; and (g) net gains at Angamos, 
one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera 
Escondida and Minera Spence . Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis 
adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.
Adjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to 
the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our 
Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as general and administrative expenses  in the Corporate segment, as 
well as business development costs, interest expense  and interest income,  other expense  and other income,  
realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses,  and net equity in earnings of affiliates .
The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to 
The AES Corporation . We believe that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the 
Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial 
performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses 
related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, 
losses due to impairments , strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement 
restructuring initiatives, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, 
which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, Adjusted PTC represents the business performance of 
the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax 
planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of 
businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparent measure that better 
assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results.  
Adjusted PTC should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to 
The AES Corporation , which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

202020192018US and Utilities South America MCAC Eurasia Corporate, Other
and EliminationsAdjusted EPS 
We define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  excluding gains or losses of 
both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses 
related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, 
losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant 
closures, the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at 
commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early 
retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, 
workforce reduction efforts, relocations and office consolidation; (g) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in 
the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; 
and (h) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations 
and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects. 
The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations. We believe that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and 
is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include 
the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities 
remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments , strategic decisions to 
dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring initiatives, the one-time impact of the 
2017 U.S. tax law reform and subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, and the non-recurring 
nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. 
Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, 
which is determined in accordance with GAAP.  90 | 2020 Annual Report

Fiscal year 2020  versus 2019
Operating Margin decreased  $116 million , or 15%, which was driven primarily by the following (in millions):
Decrease at DPL due to lower regulated retail margin primarily due to changes to DP&L’s ESP and lower volumes mainly from 
milder weather$ (63) 
Decrease due to the sale and closure of generation facilities at DPL, including a credit to depreciation expense in 2019 as a 
result of a reduction to an ARO liability and cost recoveries from DPL's joint owners of Stuart and Killen in the prior year (50) 
Decrease at Southland driven by higher losses from commodity derivatives and lower capacity sales due to unit retirements, 
partially offset by lower depreciation expense (47) 
Decrease at IPL primarily due to lower retail margin driven by lower volumes from milder weather and lower demand from the 
impact of COVID-19, partially offset by lower maintenance expense from scheduled plant outages (36)

Key Trends and Uncertainties 
During 2021  and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. 
Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, 
and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the 
challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, 
or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other 
adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The 
AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For 
the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.— Business  and Item 1A.— Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, 
and caused significant volatility in financial markets. The following discussion highlights our assessment of the 
impacts of the pandemic on our current financial and operating status, and our financial and operational outlook 
based on information known as of this filing. Also see Item 1A.— Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have conducted our essential operations without significant 
disruption. We derive approximately 85% of our total revenues from our regulated utilities and long-term sales and 95 | 2020 Annual Report
supply contracts or PPAs at our generation businesses, which contributes to a relatively stable revenue and cost 
structure at most of our businesses. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy market materialized in 
our operational locations in the second quarter and was generally better than our revised expectations for the 
second half of 2020. Across our global portfolio, our utilities businesses experienced a low single digit percentage 
decline in the fourth quarter . Our business model outside of utilities is primarily based on take-or-pay contracts or 
tolling agreements, with limited exposure to demand. Any uncontracted portion of our generation business is 
exposed to increased price risk resulting from lower demand associated with the pandemic. We are also 
experiencing a decline in electricity spot prices in some of our markets due to lower system demand. While we 
cannot predict the length and magnitude of the pandemic or how it could impact global economic conditions, a 
delayed recovery with respect to demand may adversely impact our financial results for 202 1.
We continue to monitor and manage our credit exposures in a prudent manner. Our credit exposures have 
continued in-line with historical levels and within the customary 45-60 day grace period. These impacts are 
expected to be partially offset by recoveries through U.S. regulatory rate-making mechanisms and a combination of 
the securitization of customer payment moratorium receivables and agreements with the generating companies in 
El Salvador. We have not experienced material credit-related impacts from our PPA offtakers due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.
Our supply chain management has remained robust during this challenging time and we continue to closely 
manage and monitor developments. We continue to experience certain minor delays in some of our development 
projects, primarily in permitting processes and the implementation of interconnections, due to governments and 
other authorities having limited capacity to perform their functions.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and 
signed into law on March 27, 2020. While we currently expect a limited impact from this legislation on our business, 
certain elements such as changes in the deductibility of interest may provide some cash benefits in the near term.
Additionally, the Company continues to monitor the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 
financial results and operations, which may result in the need to record a valuation allowance against deferred tax 
assets in the jurisdictions where we operate.
Macroeconomic and Political
The macroeconomic and political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business 
have changed during 2020 . This could result in significant impacts to tax laws and environmental and energy 
policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the 
subsidiary level. See Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  for further information. 
Argentina  — In the run up to the 2019 Presidential elections, the Argentine peso devalued significantly and 
the government of Argentina imposed capital controls and announced a restructuring of Argentina’s debt payments. 
Restrictions on the flow of capital have limited the availability of international credit, and economic conditions in 
Argentina have further deteriorated, triggering additional devaluation of the Argentine peso and a deterioration of the 
country’s risk profile. Following the election of Alberto Fernández in October 2019, the administration has been 
evaluating solutions to the Argentine economic crisis. On February 27, 2020, the Secretariat of Energy passed 
Resolution No. 31/2020 that includes the denomination of tariffs in local currency indexed by local inflation (currently 
delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and reductions in capacity payments received by generators. These 
regulatory changes have negatively impacted our financial results . In addition, Argentina restructured its public debt 
in 2020 through an agreement with its international creditors. Although the situation in Argentina remains 
challenging, it has not had a material impact on our current exposures to date, and payments on the long-term 
receivables for the FONINVEMEM Agreements are current. For further information, see Note 7—Financing 
Receivables  in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K.
Chile  — In October 2019, Chile saw significant protests associated with economic conditions resulting in the 
declaration of a state of emergency in several major cities. In response to the social unrest, the Chilean government 
held a referendum in October 2020, which determined that a new constitution will be drafted by a constitutional 
convention. A second vote will be held alongside municipal and gubernatorial elections in April 2021 to elect the 
members of the constitutional convention. A third vote, which is expected to occur in 2022, would accept or reject 
the new constitution after it is drafted. Other initiatives to address the concerns of the protesters are under 
consideration by Congress and could result in regulatory or policy changes that may affect our results of operations 
in Chile.96 | 2020 Annual Report
In November 2019, the Chilean government enacted Law 21,185 that establishes a Stabilization Fund for 
regulated energy prices. Historically, the government updated the prices for regulated energy contracts every six 
months to reflect the indexation the contracts have to exchange rates and commodities prices. The new law freezes 
regulated prices and does not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond 
the pricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until new lower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated into pricing in 2023. 
Consequently, costs incurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price will be accumulated and borne by generators. The 
receivables will be paid by distribution companies and the face value will be recognized by a Tariff Decree issued by 
the regulator every six months. On December 31, 2020, AES Gener executed an agreement for the sale of $105  
million of receivables generated pursuant the Tariff Stabilization Law at a discount of $20 million . Of the $85 million  
of net receivables outstanding pursuant the Tariff Stabilization Law, $23 million  were collected by AES Gener in 
February 2021.
Puerto Rico  — Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long-term PPAs with state-owned PREPA, which has 
been facing economic challenges that could result in a material adverse effect on our business in Puerto Rico. 
The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) was enacted to create a 
structure for exercising federal oversight over the fiscal affairs of U.S. territories and created procedures for 
adjusting debt accumulated by the Puerto Rico government and, potentially, other territories (“Title III”). PROMESA 
also expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical projects in Puerto Rico. 
PROMESA allowed for the establishment of an Oversight Board with broad powers of budgetary and financial 
control over Puerto Rico. The Oversight Board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of PREPA under Title III in July 2017. 
As a result of the bankruptcy filing, AES Puerto Rico and AES Ilumina’s non-recourse debt of $238 million  and $31 
million , respectively, continue to be in technical default and are classified as current as of December 31, 2020 . The 
Company is in compliance with its debt payment obligations as of December 31, 2020 .
The Company's receivable balances in Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2020  totaled $55 million , of which $1 
million  was overdue. Despite the Title III protection, PREPA has been making substantially all of its payments to the 
generators in line with historical payment patterns. 
On January 2, 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed a bill that prohibits the disposal and unencapsulated 
beneficial use of coal combustion residuals in Puerto Rico. Prior to this bill's approval, the Company had put in place 
arrangements to dispose or beneficially use its coal ash and combustion residual outside of Puerto Rico.
Considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our 
long-lived assets in Puerto Rico of $534 million is recoverable as of December 31, 2020 .
Reference Rate Reform  — In July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to 
phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rate Committee at the Federal Reserve 
identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; alternative 
reference rates in other key markets are under development. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark 
Association ("IBA") announced it had begun consultation on its intention to cease publication of two specific LIBOR 
rates by December 31, 2021, while extending the timeline for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, 
and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. The IBA expects to make separate announcements in this 
regard following the outcome of the consultation. AES holds a substantial amount of debt and derivative contracts 
referencing LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark. Although the full impact of the reform remains unknown, we have 
begun to engage with AES counterparties to discuss specific action items to be undertaken in order to prepare for 
amendments when they become due.
United States Tax Law Reform
Federal Taxes — In December 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA. The legislation significantly revised 
the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, introducing 
new limitations on interest expense deductions, subjecting foreign earnings in excess of an allowable return to 
current U.S. taxation, and adopting a semi-territorial corporate tax system. These changes impacted our 2018 and 
2019 effective tax rates and may materially impact our effective tax rate in future periods. Furthermore, we 
anticipate that growth in our U.S. businesses and higher U.S. tax expense may fully utilize our remaining net 
operating loss carryforwards in the near term, which could lead to material cash tax payments in the United States. 
Our interpretation of the TCJA may change in the event the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issue 
additional guidance. The Company's effective tax rate in 2020 reflects the application of the GILTI high-tax exclusion 
under the final regulations published on July 23, 2020. This election reduced our provision for GILTI income from, 97 | 2020 Annual Report
among others, certain subsidiaries in Chile and the Dominican Republic. Should these subsidiaries fail to qualify for 
the exclusion under the regulations, the Company’s U.S. taxable income and consolidated income tax expense for 
2020 may be materially impacted . These regulations may materially impact our future year effective tax rates and 
future cash tax obligations.
State Taxes  — The reactions of the individual states to federal tax reform are still evolving. Most states will 
assess whether and how the federal changes will be incorporated into their state tax legislation. As we expect 
higher taxable income in the future at the federal level, this may also lead to higher state taxable income. Our 
current state tax provisions predominantly have full valuation allowances against state net operating losses. These 
positions will be re-assessed in the future as state tax law evolves and may result in material changes in position.
U.S. Renewable Tax Credits — T he Consolidated Appropriations Act , 2021 ("CAA, 2021")  became law on 
December 27, 2020. Included in the CAA, 2021 is the Taxpayer  Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 
("TCDTRA"), which extends the sunset or phase-down periods of federal tax credits related to the development and 
operation of certain renewable energy electric generating facilities, and provides new tax credit extension rules 
specifically applying to offshore wind power electric generating facilities. Specifically, the TCDTRA extends the 26% 
Investment Tax Credit for qualified solar projects beginning construction in 2021 and 2022 that are placed in service 
before January 1, 2026 and permits a 22% Investment Tax Credit for qualified projects beginning construction in 
2023 that are placed in service before January 1, 2026. It also extends the 60% Production Tax Credit for onshore 
wind by one year, allowing qualified wind projects beginning construction in 2021 to be eligible.
In addition to the tax credit extender s, the TCDTRA provides for a five-year extension of the controlled foreign 
corporation look-through rule through 2025. Under this rule, dividends and interest paid by one controlled foreign 
subsidiary to another are exempt from U.S. tax. AES currently relies on the controlled foreign corporation look-
through rule to exempt dividends and interest paid between foreign subsidiaries from current U.S. tax.
Decarbonization Initiatives
Several initiatives have been announced by regulators and offtakers in recent years, with the intention of 
reducing GHG emissions generated by the energy industry. Our strategy of shifting towards clean energy platforms, 
including renewable energy, energy storage, LNG , and modernized grids is designed to position us for continued 
growth while reducing our carbon intensity. The shift to renewables has caused certain customers to migrate to 
other low-carbon energy solutions and this trend may continue. Certain of our contracts contain clauses designed to 
compensate for early contract terminations, but we cannot guarantee full recovery. Although the Company cannot 
currently estimate the financial impact of these decarbonization initiatives, new legislative or regulatory programs 
further restricting carbon emissions could require material capital expenditures, result in a reduction of the estimated 
useful life of certain coal facilities, or have other material adverse effects on our financial results. For further 
discussion of our strategy of shifting towards clean energy platforms see Item 1— Executive Summary . 
Chilean Decarbonization Plan  — The Chilean government has announced an initiative to phase out coal 
power plants by 2040 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. On June 4, 2019, AES Gener signed an agreement 
with the Chilean government to cease the operation of two coal units for a total of 322 MW as part of the phase-out. 
Under the agreement, Ventanas 1 (114 MW) will cease operation in November 2022 and Ventanas 2 (208 MW) in 
May 2024; however AES Gener has announced its intention to accelerate the disconnection of these units. On 
December 26, 2020, the Chilean government issued Supreme Decree Number 42, which allows coal plants to 
remain connected to the grid in “strategic reserve status” for five years after ceasing operations, receive a reduced 
capacity payment, and dispatch, if necessary, to ensure the electric system’s reliability. On Decemb er 29, 2020, 
Ventanas 1 ceased operation and entered "strategic reserve status ." Ventanas 2 is also expected to enter "strategic 
reserve status" in August 2021. See Item 1— Business —South America SBU —Chile  for further discussion. 
Considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our coal-
fired long-lived assets in Chile of $1.9 billion  is recoverable as of December 31, 2020 .
Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act — On April 11, 2019, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed the 
Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act (“the Act”) establishing guidelines for grid efficiency and eliminating coal as a 
source for electricity generation by January 1, 2028. The Act supports the accelerated deployment of renewables 
through the Renewable Portfolio Standard and the conversion of coal generating facilities to other fuel sources, with 
compliance targets of 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050. AES Puerto Rico’s long-term PPA with 
PREPA expires November 30, 2027. PREPA and AES Puerto Rico have discussed different strategic alternatives, 
but have yet to reach any agreement. Any agreement that may be reached would be subject to lender and 98 | 2020 Annual Report
regulatory approval, including that of the Oversight Board that filed for bankruptcy on behalf of PREPA. The 
Company is evaluating certain developments occurring during  the first quarter of 2021  to determine if a 
reassessment of the recoverability and useful life of the plant is necessary. Considering the information available as 
of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in Puerto Rico of $534 million  
is recoverable as of December 31, 2020.
Hawaii — In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature passed a bill that will prohibit AES Hawaii from 
generating electricity from coal after December 31, 2022. As this will restrict the Company from contracting the 
asset beyond the expiration of its existing PPA, management reassessed the economic useful life of the generation 
facility. A decrease in the useful life was identified as an impairment indicator. The Company performed an 
impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result,

Regulatory
AES Maritza PPA Review  — DG Comp is conducting a preliminary review of whether AES Maritza’s PPA 
with NEK is compliant with the European Union's State Aid rules. Although no formal investigation has been 
launched by DG Comp to date, AES Maritza has engaged in discussions with the DG Comp case team to discuss 
the agency’s review. In the near term, Maritza expects to engage in discussions with Bulgaria (with the involvement 
of DG Comp) to attempt to reach a negotiated resolution concerning DG Comp’s review. Separately, Bulgaria 
recently submitted its proposed plan for the reform of its electricity market to the European Commission (the “Market 
Reform Plan”). The proposed Market Reform Plan is part of Bulgaria’s plan to introduce a market-wide capacity 
remuneration mechanism, which would require approval by DG Comp. The Market Reform Plan proposes a 
deadline of June 30, 2021 for the termination of AES Maritza’s PPA, and anticipates discussions with AES Maritza 
about that issue. We do not believe termination of the PPA is justified, nor do we believe that the unilaterally 
proposed deadline for the termination of the PPA is realistic, given that the discussions with Bulgaria have not yet 
begun. We expect that the anticipated discussions with Bulgaria could involve a range of potential outcomes, 
including but not limited to the termination of the PPA and payment of some level of compensation to AES Maritza. 
Any negotiated resolution would be subject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and DG Comp approval. 
At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the anticipated discussions between AES Maritza and Bulgaria, nor 
can we predict how DG Comp might resolve its review if the discussions fail to result in an agreement concerning 
the review. AES Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all 
actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement or otherwise. However, there can 
be no assurances that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse effect on 
the Company’s financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
Considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying value of our long-
lived assets at Maritza of approximately $1.1 billion  is recoverable as of December 31, 2020 .
Tietê GSF Settlement  — In September 2020, Law 14.052/2020 published by ANEEL was approved by the 
President of Brazil, establishing terms for compensation to MRE hydro generators for the incorrect application of the 
GSF mechanism from 2013 to 2018, which resulted in higher charges assessed to MRE hydro generators by the 
regulator. Under this law, compensation will be in the form of an offer for a concession extension for each hydro 
generator, in exchange for full payment of billed  GSF trade payables. In December 2020, ANEEL published a 
regulation establishing the terms and conditions for potential compensation to Tietê in the form of a concession 
extension period of approximately 2.6 years . As a result, the previously recognized contingent liabilities related to 
GSF payments were updated to reflect the Company's best estimate for the fair value of compensation to be 
received from the concession extension offered in conjunction with the regulation. This compensation was estimated 
to have a fair value of $184 million , and was recorded as a reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales  on the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The concession extension also met the criteria for recognition  as a definite-
lived intangible asset that will be amortized from the date of the agreement, which is expected in the first quarter of 
2021, until the end of the new concession period. The value of the concession extension is based on a preliminary 
time-value equivalent calculation made by the CCEE and subsequent adjustments requested by Tietê. Both the 
concession extension period and its equivalent asset value are subject to agreement between ANEEL and AES.  99 | 2020 Annual Report
Management does not expect the agreement to result in a materially different concession extension period or 
equivalent asset value, however the final compensation value and extension period could differ from the original 
estimates as of December 31, 2020,  which could require adjustments .
Foreign Exchange Rates
We operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange  rates at varying degrees at 
the subsidiary level and between our functional currency , the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we 
operate.  In 2018 and 2019 there was a significant devaluation in the Argentine peso against the USD, which had an 
impact on our 2018 and 2019 results. Continued material devaluation of the Argentine peso against the USD could 
have an impact on our future results. The Argentine economy continues to be considered highly inflationary under 
U.S. GAAP; as such, all of our Argentine businesses are reported using the USD as the functional currency. For 
additional information, refer to Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .
Impairments 
Long-lived Assets and Equity Affiliates  — In August 2020, AES Gener reached an agreement with 
Minera Escondida and Minera Spence to early terminate two PPAs of the Angamos coal-fired plant in Chile. AES 
Gener also announced its intention to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 1 and Ventanas 2 coal-fired plants. 
Management will no longer be pursuing a contracting strategy for these assets and the plants will primarily be 
utilized as peaker plants and for grid stability. Due to these developments, the Company performed an impairment 
analysis and determined that the carrying amounts of these asset groups were not recoverable. As a result, the 
Company recognized asset impairment expense of $781 million .
During the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company recognized asset and other-than-temporary 
impairment expenses of $1.1 billion , inclusive of the asset impairment noted above. See Note 8—Investments In 
and Advances To Affiliates  and Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for further information. After recognizing these impairment expenses, the 
carrying value of our investments in equity affiliates and long-lived assets that were assessed for impairment in 
2020 totaled $2.1 billion  at December 31, 2020 . 
Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate recoverability tests and potential impairments of 
long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable 
changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological 
advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel 
sources for generation,  or an expectation it is more likely than not the asset will be  disposed of before the end of its 
estimated useful life. 
Goodwill  — The Company considers a reporting unit at risk of impairment when its fair value does not 
exceed its carrying amount by 10%. In 2019, d uring the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 
the Company determined that the fair value of its Gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 3%. 
Therefore, Gener's $868 million  goodwill balance was considered to be "at risk" largely due to the Chilean 
government's announcement to phase out coal generation by 2040, and a decline in long-term energy prices.
As a result of the long-lived asset impairments at Gener during the third quarter of 2020, the Company 
determined there was a triggering event requiring a reassessment of goodwill impairment at September 1, 2020. 
The Company determined the fair value of its Gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 13%. Although the 
fair value exceeds its carrying value by more than 10%, the Company continues to monitor the Gener reporting unit 
for potential interim goodwill impairment triggering events.
Through 2028, Gener’s plants remain largely contracted, with  PPAs expiring between 2029 and 2042. The 
Company utilized the income approach in deriving the fair value of the Gener reporting unit, which included 
estimated cash flows based on the estimated useful lives of the underlying generating asset class. These cash 
flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 7%, which was determined based on the Capital 
Asset Pricing Model. See Item 7.— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates —Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets 
and Liabilities  and Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for further information. 
While the duration and severity of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unknown, further disruptions 
in the global market could result in changes to assumptions utilized in the goodwill assessment. Impairments would 100 | 2020 Annual Report
negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors  of this Form 10-
K for further information.
The Company monitors its reporting units at risk of impairment for interim impairment indicators, and believes 
that the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable as of December 31, 2020 . Should the 
fair value of any of the Company’s reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating 
performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, regulatory changes, or other adverse conditions, 
goodwill impairment charges may be necessary in future periods. 
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Overview
As of December 31, 2020 , the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion , of which 
$71 million  was held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies. The Company had $335 million  in 
short-term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries, and restricted cash and debt service reserves of $738 million . 
The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $16.4 billion  
and $3.4 billion , respectively. Of the $1.4 billion  of our current non-recourse debt, $1.2 billion  was presented as such 
because it is due in the next twelve months and $276 million  relates to debt considered in default due to covenant 
violations. None of the defaults are payment defaults but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply 
with covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents, of which $269 million  is due to 
the bankruptcy of the offtaker. 
 We expect current maturities of non-recourse debt to be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities 
of the subsidiary to which the debt relates, through opportunistic refinancing activity, or some combination thereof. 
We have $1 million  of recourse debt which matures within the next twelve months. From time to time, we may elect 
to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when 
management believes that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on 
prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such 
repurchases may be material. 
We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent 
available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and 
investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies, and related assets. 
Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross-default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and 
affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Debt is 
typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the 
benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of 
derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt 
capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.
Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue 
interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable 
rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company has historically tried to maintain at 
least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through 
the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of 
related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's only material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate 
debt relates to drawings of $70 million  under its revolving credit facility. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's 
$20.2 billion  of total gross debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 , approximately $2.7 billion  bore interest at 
variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. Brazil holds $800 million  
of our floating rate non-recourse exposure as we have no ability to fix local debt interest rates efficiently.
In addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a 
portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, 
construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity 
investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. We generally obtain 
the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the 
proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, the 
Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have 
entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment, or other services with our subsidiaries or 101 | 2020 Annual Report
lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the Parent Company will 
be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit 
support. As of December 31, 2020 , the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-
related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited 
by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $1.4 billion  in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters 
of credit and other obligations discussed below).
As a result of the Parent Company's split rating , some counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general 
unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, 
the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to 
backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to 
such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such 
counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. As of 
December 31, 2020 , we had $110 million  in letters of credit outstanding provided under our unsecured credit 
facilities, and $77 million  in letters of credit outstanding provided under our revolving credit facility. These letters of 
credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development and construction activities and 
business operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging 
from 1% to 3% per annum on the outstanding amounts.
We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or 
businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global 
market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available 
on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a 
subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable 
to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in 
that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to 
withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to 
proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose 
our investment in that subsidiary.
Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity 
needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and 
other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the 
financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff 
increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and 
results of operations of our businesses.
Long-Term Receivables
As of December 31, 2020 , the Company had approximately $110 million  of gross accounts receivable 
classified as Other noncurrent assets . These noncurrent receivables mostly consist of accounts receivable in 
Argentina and Chile that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that 
extend beyond December 31,  2021 , or one year from the latest balance sheet date. The majority of Argentine 
receivables have been converted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. Noncurrent 
receivables in Chile pertain primarily to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by 
the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government.  A portion relates to the extension of existing PPAs with 
the addition of renewable energy. See Note 7—Financing Receivables  included in Item 8.— Financial Statements 
and Supplementary Data , Item 1.— Business—South America SBU—Argentina—Regulatory Framework and Market 
Structure , and Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—
Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Chile  of this Form 10-K for further information.
As of December 31, 2020 , the Company had approximately $1.3 billion  of loans receivable primarily related to 
a facility constructed under a BOT contract in Vietnam. This loan receivable represents contract consideration 
related to the construction of the facility, which was substantially completed in 2015, and will be collected over the 
25-year term of the plant's PPA. As of December 31, 2020, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan 
receivable balance of $1.3 billion , net of CECL reserve of $32 million , was reclassified to held-for-sale assets. Of the 
loan receivable balance, $80 million  was classified as Current held-for-sale assets and $1.2 billion  was classified as 
Noncurrent held-for-sale assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 20—Revenue  included in Item 8.—

Parent Company Liquidity
The following discussion is included as a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or 
the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as 
outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to Cash and cash 
equivalents,  which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Parent Company Liquidity may differ from similarly titled 
measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are dividends 
and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds, proceeds from debt and equity 
financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from 
asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund interest and principal repayments 
of debt, construction commitments, other equity commitments, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, taxes, 
Parent Company overhead and development costs, and dividends on common stock.108 | 2020 Annual Report
The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at 
qualified holding companies, plus available borrowings under our existing credit facility. The cash held at qualified 
holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such 
subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company 
Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, Cash and cash equivalents , at the 
periods indicated as follows (in millions):
December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019
Consolidated cash and cash equivalents $ 1,089 $ 1,029 
Less: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries  (1,018)  (1,016) 
Parent Company and qualified holding companies' cash and cash equivalents  71  13

Less: Letters of credit under the credit facility  (77)  (19) 
Less: Borrowings under the credit facility  (70)  (180) 
Borrowings available under the Parent Company credit facility  853  801 
Total Parent Company Liquidity $ 924 $ 814 
The Parent Company paid dividends of $0.57  per outstanding share to its common stockholders during the 
year ended December 31, 2020 . While we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have 
sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the 
amount of such dividends.
Recourse Debt
Our total recourse debt was $3.4 billion  at December 31, 2020  and 2019 . See Note 11—Debt  in Item 8.—
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for additional detail.
We believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. This 
belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to 
access the capital markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, 
power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to 
declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in 
loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be 
available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We have met our 
interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the Parent Company level with our revolving credit 
facility. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors —The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding 
indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries , of this Form 10-K.
Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our revolving  credit facility , contain certain 
restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items, limitations on other indebtedness; liens, 
investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions 
and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance 
sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting 
requirements. As of December 31, 2020 , we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level.
Non-Recourse Debt
While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent 
Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, 
including, without limitation:
•reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent 
Company during the time period of any default;
•triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit 
support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and
•triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company.
For example, our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include 
events of default for certain bankruptcy-related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving 
credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of 
outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.109 | 2020 Annual Report
Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding 
indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets 
amounts to $1.4 billion . The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $276 million  at December 31, 2020 , 
all of which was non-recourse debt related to three subsidiaries — AES Puerto Rico, AES Ilumina, and AES Jordan 
Solar. None of the defaults are payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply 
with other covenants or other conditions contained in the non-recourse debt documents, of which $269 million  is 
due to the bankruptcy of the offtaker. See Note 11—Debt  in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  
of this Form 10-K for additional detail.
None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of 
materiality under the Parent Company's debt agreements as of December 31, 2020 , in order for such defaults to 
trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under the Parent Company's indebtedness. However, as a result of 
additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future 
that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it 
is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and 
thereby trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent Company's 
outstanding debt securities. A material subsidiary is defined in the Parent Company's revolving credit facility as any 
business that contributed 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four 
most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2020 , none of the defaults listed above, individually or 
in the aggregate, results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company.

We have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are 
designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies 
occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary 
default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under 
power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. While we do not expect 
that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2020 , 
many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance 
that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make 
substantial payments thereunder. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the 
use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES' 
significant accounting policies are described in Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about 
matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have 
been used, or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is 
material.
Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are 
reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to 
these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit 
Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes  — We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our 
worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are 
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Certain of the Company's 
subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly 
assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of 
the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than 
not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in 
relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is 
more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company 
believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or 
future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.
Because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any 
changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax 
position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or 
enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends 
in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. 111 | 2020 Annual Report
In accordance with SAB 118, the Company made reasonable estimates of the impacts of U.S. tax reform on its 
2017 financial results, and recorded adjustments to those estimates in 2018 as analysis was completed. As of 
December 31, 2018, our analysis of the one-time impacts of the TCJA was complete under SAB 118. However, in 
the first quarter of 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department issued final regulations on the one-time transition tax which 
included changes from the proposed regulations issued in 2018.
In addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to 
the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Should 
the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state 
income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences 
between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income 
tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a 
deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which 
the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.
Impairments  — Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1—
General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company 
makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets, starting with 
determining if an impairment indicator exists. Events that may result in an impairment analysis being performed 
include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices 
or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining 
trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an 
expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated 
useful life. The Company exercises judgment in determining if these events represent an impairment indicator 
requiring the computation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. The fair value 
determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. Please see Fair Value  below for 
further detail.
As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various 
underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount 
decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion 
regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve 
uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic 
and operating conditions.
Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 9—
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  and Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense  to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Depreciation  — Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is 
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a 
composite or component basis. The Company considers many factors in its estimate of useful lives, including 
expected usage, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-taker agreements, and 
laws and regulations, among others. In certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and 
require management to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon. 
Useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, 
including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. Depreciation studies are performed periodically 
for assets subject to composite depreciation. Any change to useful lives is considered a change in accounting 
estimate and is made on a prospective basis.
Fair Value — For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1—General and Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  — A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are 
carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. 
Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as 
interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit and mutual funds. Derivatives 112 | 2020 Annual Report
are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily 
consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional 
discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 5—
Fair Value  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities  — Significant estimates are made in determining the 
fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and 
goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by VIEs are required to be recognized at fair value under 
the relevant accounting guidance. 
The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The 
Company generally utilizes the income approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a 
Discounted Cash Flow ("DCF") model to estimate fair value by discounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect 
market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.
Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of 
our cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include 
macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices, and 
commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market 
data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not 
observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic 
assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation 
differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. It is not 
uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and 
related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow 
range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions 
could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 
A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF 
model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg). 
The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the 
discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the 
most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market 
participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments  and Hedging Activities  — We enter into various derivative 
transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to 
manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions 
for trading purposes. See Note 6—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-
K for further information on the classification.
The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market 
participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will 
not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Credit 
risk for AES is evaluated at the level of the entity that is party to the contract. Nonperformance risk on the 
Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the fair value position that is derived from internally developed 
valuation models that utilize market inputs that may or may not be observable.
As a result of uncertainty, complexity, and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting 
could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different 
assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, 
volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, and future foreign exchange rates. 
Refer to Note 5—Fair Value  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.
The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, 
most of which are based on observable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for 
currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from 
market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt's). In some cases, where market data is not 
readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market 113 | 2020 Annual Report
assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, published pricing may not extend 
through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. 
Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded 
points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward 
curve. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on 
the calculated fair value.
Regulatory Assets  — Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future 
recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other 
regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs 
ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.
Consolidation  — The Company enters into transactions impacting the Company's equity interests in its 
affiliates. In connection with each transaction, the Company must determine whether the transaction impacts the 
Company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the 
variable interest model or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the 
Company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) 
the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a 
controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.
If the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether 
the Company must consolidate the entity is whether the Company, including its related parties and de facto agents, 
collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be 
consolidated by AES.
Alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve 
determining whether the non-AES shareholders have substantive participating rights. The assessment of 
shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the 
rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of 
management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and 
capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if 
shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights), then such rights would not 
overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. Significant 
judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective 
rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. While both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing 
factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  — The Company recognizes a net asset or liability reflecting 
the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses 
recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions 
of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. The valuation of the Company's benefit 
obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs requires various estimates and assumptions, the 
most significant of which include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. These assumptions are 
reviewed by the Company on an annual basis. Refer to Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Revenue Recognition  — The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of energy, capacity, and 
other services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In 
applying the revenue model, we determine whether the sale of energy, capacity, and other services represent a 
single performance obligation based on the individual market and terms of the contract. Generally, the promise to 
transfer energy and capacity represent a performance obligation that is satisfied over time and meets the criteria to 
be accounted for as a series of distinct goods or services. Progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation 
is measured using output methods, such as MWhs delivered or MWs made available, and when we are entitled to 
consideration in an amount that corresponds directly to the value of our performance completed to date, we 
recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. For further information regarding the nature 
of our revenue streams and our critical accounting policies affecting revenue recognition, see Note 1—General and 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Leases  — The Company recognizes operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the 114 | 2020 Annual Report
Consolidated Balance Sheets for most leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months. Lease liabilities and 
their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the 
expected lease term. Our subsidiaries’ incremental borrowing rates are used in determining the present value of 
lease payments when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may 
be required for items such as prepayments, lease incentives, or initial direct costs. For further information regarding 
the nature of our leases and our critical accounting policies affecting leases, see Note 1—General and Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Credit Losses — The Company uses a forward-looking "expected loss" model to recognize allowances for 
credit losses on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For 
available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the Company continues to measure credit losses as it was 
done under previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due to credit-related factors are now recognized as an 
allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations. For further information regarding credit losses, see Note 1—General and Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies  included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
New Accounting Pronouncements
 See Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  included in Item 8.— Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data  of this Form 10-K for further information about new accounting 
pronouncements adopted during 2020  and accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
Overview Regarding Market Risks  
Our businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the 
price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal, and environmental credits. In addition, our 
businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to increased competition, including from renewable sources 
such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We operate in multiple countries 
and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our 
functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest 
rate fluctuations due to our issuance of debt and related financial instruments.
The disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. 
The safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act shall 
apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A. For further information regarding market risk, see Item 1A.— Risk 
Factors , Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations ; Wholesale power prices are declining in many markets and 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and opportunities for future growth;  We may not be 
adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates; and Certain of our 
businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology  of this 2020  Form 10-K.
Commodity Price Risk
Although we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuels, 
and environmental credits, some of our generation businesses operate under short-term sales or under contract 
sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs. These 
businesses subject our operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels, and environmental credits in 
competitive markets. We employ risk management strategies to hedge our financial performance against the effects 
of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these strategies can involve the use of physical 
and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps, and options. 
The portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreements or contracted businesses 
where indexation is not perfectly matched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When 
hedging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract sales that lock in the spread per MWh between 
variable costs and the price at which the electricity can be sold. 
AES businesses will see changes in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2021, 
we project pre-tax earnings exposure on a 10% move in commodity prices would be less than $5 million for power, 115 | 2020 Annual Report
less than $(5) million for natural gas, $(5) million for coal, and less than $5 million for oil.  Our estimates exclude 
correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas prices can be accompanied by 
a decline in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure occurs 
with lower power, lower oil, higher natural gas, and higher coal prices. Exposures at individual businesses will 
change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices 
generally increases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses.
Commodity prices affect our businesses differently depending on the local market characteristics and risk 
management strategies. Spot power prices, contract indexation provisions, and generation costs can be directly or 
indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas, oil, and coal. We have some natural offsets across our 
businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost to others. Exposures are 
not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. 
Examples of these factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply 
issues, regional competition, bidding strategies, and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational 
flexibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance, certain power plants may limit downside exposure by 
reducing dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume 
sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions, resulting in a higher 
or lower volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output 
available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting power prices.
In the US and Utilities SBU, the generation businesses are largely contracted but may have residual risk to the 
extent contracts are not perfectly indexed to the business drivers. At Southland, our existing once-through cooling 
generation units (“Legacy Assets”) have been requested to continue operating beyond their current retirement date 
and have been approved for an extended permit for between one and three years. These assets have contracts in 
capacity and have seen incremental value in energy revenues.
In the South America SBU, our business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the 
country and has a portfolio of contract sales in both. The significant portion of our PPAs include mechanisms of 
indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations in the price of coal, with the specific indices and 
timing varying by contract, in order to mitigate changes in the price of fuel. For the portion of our contracts not 
indexed to the price of coal, we have implemented a hedging strategy based on international coal financial 
instruments for up to 3 years. In Colombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market 
exposure for uncontracted volumes. Because we own hydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. 
Additionally, in Brazil, the hydroelectric generating facility is covered by contract sales. Under normal hydrological 
volatility, spot price risk is mitigated through a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators in 
the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover the business' contract 
position, and therefore it may have to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation. 
In the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes. Panama is highly 
contracted under financial and load-following PPA type structures, exposing the business to hydrology-based 
variance. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or less than the contract volumes, the business will be 
sensitive to changes in spot power prices which may be driven by oil and natural gas prices in some time periods. In 
the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas- and coal-fired assets  contracted under a portfolio of contract sales, 
and both contract and spot prices may move with commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do not always 
match our generation availability and our assets may be sellers of spot prices in excess of contract levels or a net 
buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations.
In the Eurasia SBU, our assets operating in Vietnam and Bulgaria have minimal exposure to commodity price 
risk as it has no or minor merchant exposure and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks 
that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact 
that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, 
the USD. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in 
USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calculate and pay 
taxes in currencies other than their own functional currency. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the 
exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, 
Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. These subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to 116 | 2020 Annual Report
limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign 
exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and options where possible to manage our risk 
related to certain foreign currency fluctuations.
AES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize the impact of 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also 
designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to variation of timing and amount 
between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on 
a realized basis, which could result in greater volatility in earnings.  The largest foreign exchange risks over a 12-
month forward-looking period stem from the following currencies: Brazilian real, Colombian peso, and Euro . As of 
December 31, 2020 , assuming a 10% USD appreciation, cash distributions attributable to foreign subsidiaries 
exposed to movement in the exchange rate are projected to be impacted by less than $(5) million each for Brazilian 
real, Colombia peso, and Euro. These numbers have been produced by applying a one-time 10% USD appreciation 
to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2021  coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to the 
currencies listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. The 
numbers presented above are net of any transactional gains/losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as 
new hedges are executed or existing hedges are unwound. Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions 
exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further modification. The sensitivities presented do not capture the 
impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.
Interest Rate Risks
We are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable-rate and 
fixed-rate debt, as well as interest rate swap, cap, floor, and option agreements. Decisions on the fixed-floating debt 
mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending on whether 
a plant's capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest 
rate fluctuations by arranging fixed- or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particularly for non-recourse 
financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap, and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate 
exposure on the underlying financing. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recourse financings at our 
businesses. 
As of December 31, 2020 , the portfolio's pre-tax earnings exposure for 2021  to a one-time 100-basis-point 
increase in interest rates for our Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Euro, and USD 
denominated debt would be approximately $20 million on interest expense for the debt denominated in these 
currencies. These amounts do not take into account the historical correlation between these interest rates.117 | 2020 Annual Report
ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The AES Corporation (the Company) as of 
December 31, 2020  and 2019 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), 
changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 , and the 
related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the 
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020  and 2019 , and the results of its 
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 , in conformity with 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 , based on 
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2021 , expressed 
an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with 
the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal 
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial 
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to 
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, 
subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit 
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.118 | 2020 Annual Report
Goodwill Impairment Evaluation of the Gener Reporting Unit
Description of 
the MatterThe Company’s goodwill balance was $1,061 million at December 31, 2020, of which $868 
million relates to the Gener reporting unit. As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Company’s goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting 
unit level. The goodwill impairment test at the Gener reporting unit involves the use of 
significant unobservable inputs to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. This estimate of 
fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine whether goodwill 
is impaired.  
Auditing the Company's measurement of the fair value of the Gener reporting unit involved a 
high degree of subjectivity given the lack of observable inputs to estimate the reporting unit’s fair 
value. Key inputs that had a significant impact on the valuation included the prospective 
financial information (including the estimated growth in renewable projects, forward electricity 
prices and developments in the Chilean capacity market) and the discount rate, which are 
forward-looking and based upon expectations about future economic and market conditions.
How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process at the Gener reporting unit. 
For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the valuation model, the 
significant assumptions used to develop the estimates, and the completeness and accuracy of 
the data used in the valuations.
To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s Gener reporting unit, we performed audit 
procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to develop the 
estimate of fair value, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and testing the 
completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We 
compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic 
trends as well as historical results. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s 
estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes 
in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also 
involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodologies and the 
discount rate used in the fair value estimate.
Evaluation of Impairment Indicators and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives
Description of 
the MatterAt December 31, 2020, the Company's property, plant and equipment had an aggregate net 
carrying value of approximately $22,826 million. As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated 
financial statements,  when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a 
held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for 
potential impairment, and re-evaluates the remaining useful life. These circumstances may 
include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, demand, power prices or 
fuel costs, technological advancements, physical deterioration, or an expectation it is more likely 
than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its useful life.
Auditing the Company's identification and evaluation of impairment indicators involved 
significant auditor judgment considering the many geographic, regulatory and economic 
environments in which the Company operates. Similarly, auditing the Company’s re-evaluation 
of useful lives required a high degree of subjectivity, particularly as it relates to the Company’s 
coal generation assets given the Company’s decarbonization initiatives and the potential risks 
associated with climate change that have led to increased regulation and other actions. These 
audit procedures required an evaluation of a wide variety of circumstances for potential changes 
in useful lives or impairment indicators.119 | 2020 Annual Report
How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over the Company’s identification of impairment indicators and estimation of useful lives 
(including any changes if necessary). This included management’s monitoring controls over 
businesses that have had been affected or are expected to be affected by the circumstances 
above. 
Our audit procedures included, among others, making inquiries of management (including 
personnel in operations) to understand changes in the businesses, reading industry journals 
and publications to independently identify changes in the regulatory environments or the 
geographic areas and evaluating whether management has considered identified changes, if 
any. We considered businesses for which current power prices are significantly less than 
contractual prices within Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that are also near expiration. We 
also considered the Company’s ability to re-contract certain of its coal generation assets upon 
the expiration of a PPA, given the most recent legislative or regulatory changes. We evaluated 
the Company’s analysis of the useful lives of its coal generation assets, considering the existing 
PPAs and the Company’s ability to use the assets subsequent to the expiration of a PPA, based 
on any regulatory or market changes. For projects that were still under construction, we 
compared the Company's actual progress to their budgets, inspected engineering reports when 
considered appropriate, and considered project overruns. We reviewed disaggregated financial 
results for deterioration in earnings performance compared to prior periods, negative cash flows 
from operations, and working capital deficiencies and assessed whether these would represent 
impairment indicators, when applicable. We also considered and assessed conditions and 
trends in the industry and the underlying economies and evaluated sale or disposition activities.
Long-Lived Asset Impairment Evaluation of AES Gener
Description of 
the MatterAs disclosed in Footnote 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized 
an asset impairment expense at AES Gener in Chile as a result of the early termination of two 
PPAs at the Angamos coal-fired plant and the Company’s intention to accelerate the retirement 
of the Ventanas 1 and Ventanas 2 coal-fired plants. Based on the impairment analyses, the 
Company determined that the carrying amounts of these asset groups were not recoverable and 
recognized a $781 million asset impairment expense, which represented the amount by which 
the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of $306 million.
Auditing the Company’s long-lived asset impairment analyses involved significant judgment 
related to the assessment of the asset groups and estimation of the related fair value. The 
assessment of the asset groups required considerable judgment as varying facts and 
circumstances could justify different grouping of assets for impairment review. Auditing the 
Company’s estimates of the fair value of asset groups in AES Gener involved a high degree of 
subjectivity given the lack of observable inputs to estimate the fair value. Key inputs that had a 
significant impact on the valuation included the prospective financial information (including the 
retirement dates of the plants) and the discount rate, which are forward-looking and based upon 
expectations about future economic and market conditions.120 | 2020 Annual Report
How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over the Company’s long-lived asset impairment process. For example, we tested 
controls over management’s review of the valuation model, the significant assumptions used to 
develop the estimates, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations.
Our audit procedures included, among others, obtaining an understanding of how the plants are 
managed at AES Gener given the regulatory changes, evaluating management’s assessment of 
the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, assessing the appropriateness of methodologies, 
testing the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy 
of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant 
assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, latest regulations 
as well as historical results. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates 
and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair 
value of the asset groups that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved 
valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodology and the discount rate 
used in the fair value estimate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The AES Corporation is a holding company (the "Parent Company") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, 
(collectively, "AES" or "the Company") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and 
distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent 
Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability 
entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a 
subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial 
statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. 
GAAP").
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the 
accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an 
ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany 
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the 
ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS — Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of 
equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net 
income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected separately from 
consolidated net income and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and 
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling 
financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling 
interests. Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrolling interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' 
basis has been reduced to zero.
Equity securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer are classified 
outside of permanent equity. Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. Subsequent measurement and 
classification vary depending on whether the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. When the equity 
instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, subsequent allocation of income and dividends is classified in 
permanent equity. For those securities where it is probable that the instrument will become redeemable or that are 
currently redeemable, AES recognizes changes in the fair value at each accounting period against retained 
earnings or additional paid-in-capital in the absence of retained earnings, subject to the floor of the initial fair value. 
Further, the allocation of income and dividends, as well as the adjustment to fair value, is classified outside 
permanent equity. Instruments that are mandatorily redeemable are classified as a liability.
EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS — Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to 
exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported 
in Investments in and advances to affiliates  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s proportionate 
share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in  Net equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates  on the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations . 
The Company utilizes the cumulative earning approach to determine whether distributions received from equity 
method investees are returns on investment or returns of investment. The Company discontinues the application of 
the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero and the Company is not otherwise committed to provide 
further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application of the equity method accounting to 
the extent that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded. 
Upon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities 
and the basis difference between each fair value and the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in 
the financial statements of the investee. The AES share of the amortization of the basis difference is recognized in  
Net equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the life of the asset or 
liability.
The Company periodically assesses if impairment indicators exist at our equity method investments. When an 
impairment is observed, any excess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment 127 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements | December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
expense when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included in Other non-operating expense  in 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
BUSINESS INTERESTS — Acquisitions and disposals of business interests are generally transactions 
pertaining to operational legal entities, which may be accounted for as a consolidated business, an asset, or an 
equity method investment. Losses on expected sales of business interests are limited to the impairment of long-
lived assets as of the date of execution of the sales agreement, which are recognized in Asset impairment expense  
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any additional gains/(losses) on sales, which are primarily due to 
reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments, are recognized in Gain (loss) on disposal and sale of 
business interests  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon completion of the sale. 
ALLOCATION OF EARNINGS  — Certain of the Company's businesses are subject to profit-sharing 
arrangements where the allocation of cash distributions and the sharing of tax benefits are not based on fixed 
ownership percentages. These arrangements exist for certain U.S. renewable generation partnerships to designate 
different allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or percentage over the life of 
the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) 
method when it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. The HLBV method calculates the 
proceeds that would be attributable to each partner based on the liquidation provisions of the respective operating 
partnership agreement if the partnership was to be liquidated at book value at the balance sheet date. Each 
partner’s share of income in the period is equal to the change in the amount of net equity they are legally able to 
claim based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the end of a reporting period compared to the beginning of 
that period, adjusted for any capital transactions. 
The HLBV method is used both to allocate the equity earnings attributable to AES when the Company 
accounts for the renewable business as an equity method investment and to calculate the earnings attributable to 
noncontrolling interest when the business is consolidated by AES. In the early months of operations of a renewable 
generation facility where HLBV results in a significant decrease in the hypothetical liquidation proceeds attributable 
to the tax equity investor due to the recognition of investment tax credits ("ITCs") or other adjustments as required 
by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Company records the impact (sometimes referred to as the ‘Day one gain’) 
to income in the same period. 
USE OF ESTIMATES — U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
asset and liability balances reported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the revenues 
and expenses recognized during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject 
to such estimates and assumptions include: the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; 
asset retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuation 
allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; the 
fair value of financial instruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as business combinations or as 
asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; contingent consideration arising from business combinations or asset 
acquisitions by variable interest entities; the measurement of equity method investments or noncontrolling interest 
using the HLBV method for certain renewable generation partnerships; pension liabilities; the incremental borrowing 
rates used in the determination of lease liabilities; the determination of lease and non-lease components in certain 
generation contracts; environmental liabilities; and potential litigation claims and settlements.
HELD-FOR-SALE DISPOSAL GROUPS — A disposal group classified as held-for-sale is reflected on the 
balance sheet at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. A loss is recognized if the 
carrying amount of the disposal group exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell. This loss is limited to the 
carrying value of long-lived assets until the completion of the sale, at which point, any additional loss is recognized. 
If the fair value of the disposal group subsequently exceeds the carrying amount while the disposal group is still 
held-for-sale, any impairment expense previously recognized will be reversed up to the lesser of the previously 
recognized expense or the subsequent excess.
Assets and liabilities related to a disposal group classified as held-for-sale are segregated in the current 
balance sheet in the period in which the disposal group is classified as held-for-sale. Assets and liabilities of held-
for-sale disposal groups are classified as current when they are expected to be disposed of within twelve months. 
Transactions between the held-for-sale disposal group and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after 
the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. See 
Note 25—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions  for further information.128 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS — Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a 
business or a group of businesses represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the 
Company's operations and financial results. The Company reports financial results for discontinued operations 
separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing 
operations. Prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets 
are retrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to be discontinued operations. The cash flows of 
businesses that are determined to be discontinued operations are included within the relevant categories within 
operating, investing and financing activities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Transactions between the businesses determined to be discontinued operations and businesses that are 
expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations 
and balances held-for-sale. The results of discontinued operations include any gain or loss recognized on closing or 
adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell, including gains or losses associated with 
noncontrolling interests upon completion of the disposal transaction. Adjustments related to components previously 
reported as discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance are presented as discontinued operations in 
the current period even if the disposed-of component to which the adjustments are related would not meet the 
criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under current guidance. See Note 24—Discontinued 
Operations  for further information.
FAIR VALUE — Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly, hypothetical transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company 
applies the fair value measurement accounting guidance to financial assets and liabilities in determining the fair 
value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line 
items Short-term investments  and Other noncurrent assets ; derivative assets, included in Other current assets  and 
Other noncurrent assets ; and, derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current)  and Other 
noncurrent liabilities . The Company applies the fair value measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and 
liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or an asset acquisition by a variable interest entity, or in conjunction 
with the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group, equity 
method investments, or goodwill. 
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be reflected at their fair 
values, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer 
restrictions and risk of nonperformance. The Company is prohibited from including transaction costs and any 
adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value.
In determining fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes 
the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are categorized within a fair value hierarchy based upon the 
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement:
•Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in 
active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 
that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for 
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
•Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair 
values of the assets or liabilities.
Any transfers between all levels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting 
period.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS — The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, cash balances not 
restricted as to withdrawal or usage, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities 
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. 
RESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES — Cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or 
usage, primarily via contract, are considered restricted cash.129 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
The following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash amounts reported on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets that reconcile to the total of such amounts as shown on the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows (in millions): 
December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019
Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,089 $ 1,029 
Restricted cash  297  336 
Debt service reserves and other deposits  441  207 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ 1,827 $ 1,572 
INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES — The Company's marketable investments are primarily 
unsecured debentures, certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. 
Short-term investments consist of marketable equity securities and debt securities with original maturities in 
excess of three months with remaining maturities of less than one year. Marketable debt securities where the 
Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried 
at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. Remaining marketable debt 
securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value.
 Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are not credit-related are reflected in 
AOCL, a separate component of equity, and the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. Any credit-
related impairments are recognized as an allowance with a corresponding impact recognized as a credit loss in 
Other Expense. Unrealized gains or losses on equity investments are reported in Other income . Interest and 
dividends on investments are reported in Interest income  and Other income , respectively. Gains and losses on 
sales of investments are determined using the specific identification method.
ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — Accounts 
and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of 
accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable 
and other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance for doubtful accounts in 
accordance with ASC 326 for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and 
notes receivable are generally recognized in Cost of Sales . Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts 
receivable. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasonably 
assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off 
when they are no longer deemed collectible.
INVENTORY — Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and 
operational spare parts and supplies used to maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is 
carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and expenditures incurred to 
bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method. Generally, if 
it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered through revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is 
recognized to reflect the fuel at net realizable value. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typically 
reduced only in instances where the items are considered obsolete.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS — Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, assets under finance 
leases and intangible assets subject to amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets).
Property, plant and equipment — Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated 
depreciation. The cost of renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment 
are capitalized.
Construction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly 
relating to construction in progress are capitalized during the construction period, provided the completion of the 
construction project is deemed probable, or expensed at the time construction completion is determined to no 
longer be probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to risks related to successful completion, 
including those related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contract 
compliance. Construction-in-progress balances are transferred to electric generation and distribution assets when 
an asset group is ready for its intended use. Government subsidies, liquidated damages recovered for construction 
delays, and income tax credits are recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment and reflected in cash 
flows from investing activities. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 130 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or 
component basis. Capital spare parts, including rotable spare parts, are included in electric generation and 
distribution assets. If the spare part is considered a component, it is depreciated over its useful life after the part is 
placed in service. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset, the part is depreciated over the composite 
useful life even when being held as a spare part.
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries operate under concession contracts. Certain estimates are utilized to 
determine depreciation expense for the subsidiaries, including the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment 
and the amounts to be recovered at the end of the concession contract. The amounts to be recovered under these 
concession contracts are based on estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual amounts recovered may differ 
from those estimates.  These concession contracts are not within the scope of ASC 853— Service Concession 
Arrangements .
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization — Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
which range from 1 – 50 years and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line item Other intangible 
assets. The Company accounts for purchased emission allowances as intangible assets and records an expense 
when they are utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued at zero.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets — When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a 
held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using 
internal projections of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or 
changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse 
changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition 
due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it 
is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the 
carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized for the 
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value (subject to the carrying amount not 
being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort). 
An impairment expense for certain assets may be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset if recovery 
through approved rates is probable.
DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS — Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred 
and presented as a direct reduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing 
period using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit or revolving credit facility 
are deferred and presented as an asset and amortized over the related financing period. Make-whole payments in 
connection with early debt retirements are classified as cash flows used in financing activities .
GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS — The Company evaluates goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in 
circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annual impairment testing date is October 
1st.
Goodwill — Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the business acquisition over the fair 
value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill resulting from an acquisition is assigned to the reporting units that 
are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Generally, each AES business with a goodwill balance 
constitutes a reporting unit as they are not similar to other businesses in a segment nor are they reported to 
segment management together with other businesses.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or the quantitative test 
option to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss 
measured at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the 
carrying amount of goodwill, is recorded. 
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include land-
use rights and water rights. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment either under the 
qualitative assessment option or the two-step quantitative test. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset being 
tested for impairment exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as impairment expense. 131 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES — Accounts payable consists of amounts due 
to trade creditors related to the Company's core business operations. These payables include amounts owed to 
vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased for resale, fuel, maintenance, inventory and other raw 
materials. Other accrued liabilities include items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legal contingencies and 
employee-related costs, including payroll, and benefits.
REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES — The Company recognizes assets and liabilities that result from 
regulated ratemaking processes. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs which have been deferred 
due to the probable future recovery via customer rates. Generally, returns earned on regulatory assets are reflected 
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest Income . Regulatory liabilities generally represent 
obligations to refund customers. Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future 
recovery and regulatory liabilities are probable of future payment by considering factors such as applicable 
regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or 
potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs previously deferred ceases to be probable, the related 
regulatory assets are written off and recognized in income from continuing operations.
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS — The Company recognizes in its Consolidated 
Balance Sheets an asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with 
current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of the 
Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future 
rates. All plan assets are recorded at fair value. AES follows the measurement date provisions of the accounting 
guidance, which require a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obligations for all defined benefit plans .
INCOME TAXES — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences 
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, 
and their respective income tax basis. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than 
not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax positions are evaluated under 
a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement analysis before they are recognized for financial 
statement reporting.
Uncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid 
within one year. The Company's policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize 
interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations.
The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, 
no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.
The Company applies the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS — The Company records the fair value of a liability for a legal 
obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. When a new liability is recognized, the 
Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The 
liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the 
related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, the Company eliminates the liability and, based on the actual cost 
to retire, may incur a gain or loss .
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the business operates and is generally the currency in which the business 
generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is a currency other than the 
U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the end of 
the fiscal period. Adjustments arising from the translation of the balance sheet of such subsidiaries are included in 
AOCL. The revenue and expense accounts of such subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at the 
average exchange rates for the period . Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are 
long-term in nature and which the Company does not intend to settle in the foreseeable future, are also recognized 
in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency are included in determining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translation 
adjustments are reclassified from AOCL to net income only when realized upon sale or upon complete or 
substantially complete liquidation of the investment in a foreign entity.  The accumulated adjustments are included in 132 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
carrying amounts in impairment assessments where the Company has committed to a plan that will cause the 
accumulated adjustments to be reclassified to earnings .
REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue is earned from the sale of electricity from our utilities and the 
production and sale of electricity and capacity from our generation facilities. Revenue is recognized upon the 
transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed 
on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.
Utilities  — Our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers 
directly. The majority of our utility contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promises to transfer 
energy, capacity, and other distribution and/or transmission services are not distinct. Additionally, as the 
performance obligation is satisfied over time as energy is delivered, and the same method is used to measure 
progress, the performance obligation meets the criteria to be considered a series. Utility revenue is classified as 
regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to 
government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (“tariffs”) that our utilities are allowed to 
charge customers for electricity. Since tariffs are determined by the regulator, the price that our utilities have the 
right to bill corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the utility's performance completed in each period. 
The Company also has some month-to-month contracts. Revenue under these contracts is recognized using an 
output method measured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to 
the customer, at the approved tariff. 
The Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility 
businesses generally purchase power to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate 
PPAs. In these instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis because the 
transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose to receive 
generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Company may serve as a billing agent for the 
provider and recognize revenue on a net basis.
Generation — Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts to customers such as utilities, 
industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our generation contracts, based on specific facts and circumstances, can 
have one or more performance obligations as the promise to transfer energy, capacity, and other services may or 
may not be distinct depending on the nature of the market and terms of the contract. As the performance obligations 
are generally satisfied over time and use the same method to measure progress, the performance obligations meet 
the criteria to be considered a series. In measuring progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation, the 
Company applies the "right to invoice" practical expedient when available, and recognizes revenue in the amount to 
which the Company has a right to consideration from a customer that corresponds directly with the value of the 
performance completed to date. Revenue from generation businesses is classified as non-regulated on the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
For contracts determined to have multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance 
obligation based on its relative standalone selling price using a market or expected cost plus margin approach. 
Additionally, the Company allocates variable consideration to one or more, but not all, distinct goods or services that 
form part of a single performance obligation when (1) the variable consideration relates specifically to the efforts to 
transfer the distinct good or service and (2) the variable consideration depicts the amount to which the Company 
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.
Revenue from generation contracts is recognized using an output method, as energy and capacity delivered 
best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Performance obligations including energy or ancillary 
services (such as operations and maintenance and dispatch services) are generally measured by the MWh 
delivered. Capacity, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer, is measured 
using MWs. In certain contracts, if plant availability exceeds a contractual target, the Company may receive a 
performance bonus payment, or if the plant availability falls below a guaranteed minimum target, we may incur a 
non-availability penalty. Such bonuses or penalties represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated 
and recognized when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal. 
In assessing whether variable quantities are considered variable consideration or an option to acquire 
additional goods and services, the Company evaluates the nature of the promise and the legally enforceable rights 133 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
in the contract. In some contracts, such as requirement contracts, the legally enforceable rights merely give the 
customer a right to purchase additional goods and services which are distinct. In these contracts, the customer's 
action results in a new obligation, and the variable quantities are considered an option.  
When energy or capacity is sold or purchased in the spot market or to ISOs, the Company assesses the facts 
and circumstances to determine gross versus net presentation of spot revenues and purchases. Generally, the 
nature of the performance obligation is to sell surplus energy or capacity above contractual commitments, or to 
purchase energy or capacity to satisfy deficits. Generally, on an hourly basis, a generator is either a net seller or a 
net buyer in terms of the amount of energy or capacity transacted with the ISO. In these situations, the Company 
recognizes revenue for the hours where the generator is a net seller and cost of sales for the hours where the 
generator is a net buyer.
Certain generation contracts contain operating leases where capacity payments are generally considered 
lease elements. In such cases, the allocation between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of 
the lease following the guidance in ASC 842. 
The transaction price allocated to a construction performance obligation is recognized as revenue over time as 
construction activity occurs, with revenue being fully recognized upon completion of construction. These contracts 
may include a difference in timing between revenue recognition and the collection of cash receipts, which may be 
collected over the term of the entire arrangement. The timing difference could result in a significant financing 
component for the construction performance obligation if determined to be a material component of the transaction 
price. The Company accounts for a significant financing component under the effective interest rate method, 
recognizing a long-term receivable for the expected future payments related to the construction performance 
obligation in the Loan Receivable line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As payments are collected from 
the customer over the term of the contract, consideration related to the construction performance obligation is 
bifurcated between the principal repayment of the long-term receivable and the related interest income, recognized 
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Contract Balances  — The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts 
receivable and contract liabilities. Accounts receivable represent unconditional rights to consideration and consist of 
both billed amounts and unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under long-term contracts when revenue 
recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. We bill both generation and utilities customers on a 
contractually agreed-upon schedule, typically at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly). The calculation of revenue earned 
but not yet billed is based on the number of days not billed in the month, the estimated amount of energy delivered 
during those days and the estimated average price per customer class for that month . 
Our contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the 
timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. The current portion of our contract liabilities is reported in Accrued 
and other liabilities  and the noncurrent portion is reported in Other noncurrent liabilities  on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. 
Remaining Performance Obligations — The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations 
represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the 
reporting period. The Company has elected to apply the optional disclosure exemptions under ASC 606. Therefore, 
the amount disclosed in Note 20—Revenue  excludes contracts with an original length of one year or less, contracts 
for which we recognize revenue based on the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed, and 
variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation when the consideration 
relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and depicts the amount to which we expect to 
be entitled. As such, consideration for energy is excluded from the amount disclosed as the variable consideration 
relates to the amount of energy delivered and reflects the value the Company expects to receive for the energy 
transferred. Estimates of revenue expected to be recognized in future periods also exclude unexercised customer 
options to purchase additional goods or services that do not represent material rights to the customer.
LEASES — The Company has operating and finance leases for energy production facilities, land, office space, 
transmission lines, vehicles and other operating equipment in which the Company is the lessee. Operating leases 
with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, but are expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictive 
covenants or subleases.134 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities 
represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are 
recognized on commencement of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. 
Generally, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable; as such, we use the subsidiaries’ incremental 
borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease 
payments. The Company determines discount rates based on its existing credit rates of its unsecured borrowings, 
which are then adjusted for the appropriate lease term and currency. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease 
payments made and excludes lease incentives that are paid or payable to the lessee at commencement. The lease 
term includes the option to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
The Company has operating leases for certain generation contracts that contain provisions to provide capacity 
to a customer, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer in which the 
Company is the lessor. Capacity payments are generally considered lease elements as they cover the majority of 
available output from a facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease and non-lease elements is 
made at the inception of the lease. Fixed lease  payments from such contracts are recognized as lease revenue on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas variable lease payments are recognized when earned.
The Company has sales-type leases for BESS in which the Company is the lessor. These arrangements allow 
customers the ability to determine when to charge and discharge the BESS, representing the transfer of control and 
constitutes the arrangement as a sales-type lease. Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the leased 
asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on the 
present value of fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the underlying asset.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The Company grants share-based compensation in the form of stock 
options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and performance cash units. The expense is based on the 
grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the 
requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to 
estimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES — General and administrative expenses include corporate 
and other expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive management, finance, 
legal, human resources and information systems, which are not directly allocable to our business segments. 
Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as general and 
administrative expenses.
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES — Under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, 
the Company recognizes all contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal 
purchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and 
measures those instruments at fair value. See Note 5—Fair Value  and Fair value  in this section for additional 
discussion regarding the determination of fair value. 
PPAs and fuel supply agreements are evaluated to assess if they contain either a derivative or an embedded 
derivative requiring separate valuation and accounting. Generally, these agreements do not meet the definition of a 
derivative, often due to the inability to be net settled. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the markets for commodities 
to be delivered under these agreements to determine if facts and circumstances have changed such that the 
agreements could be net settled and meet the definition of a derivative.
The Company typically designates its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges if they meet the criteria 
specified in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to 
hedge the variability of expected future cash interest payments. Foreign currency contracts are used to reduce risks 
arising from the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The objective of 
these practices is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating results. The Company also 
enters into commodity contracts to economically hedge price variability inherent in electricity sales arrangements. 
The objectives of the commodity contracts are to minimize the impact of variability in spot electricity prices and 
stabilize estimated revenue streams. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
For our hedges, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCL and are recognized into earnings as the hedged 
transactions affect earnings. If a derivative is no longer highly effective, hedge accounting will be discontinued 
prospectively. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, AES estimates the future cash flows of the 
forecasted transactions and evaluates the probability of the occurrence and timing of such transactions. 135 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are immediately 
recognized in earnings. Regardless of when gains or losses on derivatives are recognized in earnings, they are 
generally classified as interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transaction 
gains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regulated revenue or non-regulated cost of sales for 
commodity and other derivatives. Cash flows arising from derivatives are included in the Consolidated Statements 
of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the underlying risk being economically hedged and the 
lack of significant financing elements, except that cash flows on designated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate 
interest during construction are classified as an investing activity.  The Company has elected not to offset net 
derivative positions in the financial statements.
CREDIT LOSSES — In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records an allowance for current expected 
credit losses (“CECL”) for accounts and notes receivable, financing receivables, contract assets, net investments in 
leases recognized as a lessor, held-to-maturity debt securities, financial guarantees related to the non-payment of a 
financial obligation, and off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance. The CECL allowance is 
based on the asset's amortized cost and reflects management's expected risk of credit losses over the remaining 
contractual life of the asset. CECL allowances are estimated using relevant information about the collectibility of 
cash flows and consider information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable 
forecasts of future economic conditions. See New Accounting Pronouncements below for further information 
regarding the impact on the Company's financial statements upon adoption of ASC 326.

stockholders’ equity.
ASC 326 — Financial Instruments — Credit Losses
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses  and its 
subsequent corresponding updates (“ASC 326”). The new standard updates the impairment model for financial 
assets measured at amortized cost, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. For trade and 
other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments, entities are required to use a new 
forward-looking "expected loss" model that generally results in the earlier recognition of an allowance for credit 
losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities measure credit losses as it was done 
under previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due to credit-related factors are now recognized as an 
allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the income statement. 
The Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption for ASC 326. Under this transition 
method, the Company applied the transition provisions starting at the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of the 
adoption of ASC 326 on our January 1, 2020 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows (in millions):136 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018

(1)Other current assets  include the short-term portion of the Mong Duong loan receivable, which was reclassified to Current held-for-sale assets  on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 .
(2)Loan receivable at Mong Duong was reclassified to Noncurrent held-for-sale assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 .
(3)Other noncurrent assets  include Argentina financing receivables.
Mong Duong  — The Mong Duong II power plant in Vietnam is the primary driver of changes in credit reserves 
under the new standard. This plant is operated under a build, operate, and transfer (“BOT”) contract and will be 
transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25-year PPA. A loan receivable was recognized 
in 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606 in order to account for the future expected payments for the construction 
performance obligation portion of the BOT contract. As the payments for the construction performance obligation 
occur over a 25-year term, a significant financing element was determined to exist which is accounted for under the 
effective interest rate method. Historically, the Company has not incurred any losses on this arrangement, of which 
no directly comparable assets exist in the market. In order to determine expected credit losses under ASC 326 
arising from this $1.4 billion  loan receivable as of January 1, 2020, the Company considered average historical 
default and recovery rates on similarly rated sovereign bonds, which formed an initial basis for developing a 
probability of default, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator for this arrangement. 
A resulting estimated loss rate of 2.4%  was applied to the weighted-average remaining life of the loan receivable, 
after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including the Company’s status as a large foreign direct 
investor in Vietnam, Mong Duong’s status as critical energy infrastructure in Vietnam, and cash flows from the 
operations of the plant, which are under the Company’s control until the end of the BOT contract. As a result of this 
analysis, the Company recognized an opening CECL reserve of $34 million  as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit  
and Noncontrolling interests as of January 1, 2020.
Argentina — Exposure to  CAMMESA, the administrator of the wholesale energy market in Argentina, is the 
driver of credit reserves in Argentina. As discussed in Note 7—Financing Receivables , the Company has credit 
exposures through the FONINVEMEM Agreements, other agreements related to resolutions passed by the 
Argentine government in which AES Argentina will receive compensation for investments in new generation plants 
and technologies, as well as regular accounts receivable balances. The timing of collections depends on 
corresponding agreements and collectability of these receivables are assessed on an ongoing basis.
Collection of the principal and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and 
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continued operation of power plants which generate cash for 
payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and amount of collections, and 
economic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentine 
government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. Historically, the Company has not 
incurred any credit-related losses on these receivables. In order to determine expected credit losses under ASC 
326, the Company considered historical default probabilities utilizing similarly rated sovereign bonds and historic 
recovery rates for Argentine government bond defaults. This information formed an initial basis for developing a 
probability of default, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator across the underlying 
financing receivables. A resulting estimated weighted average loss rate of 41.2%  was applied to the remaining 
balance of these receivables, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including AES Argentina’s 
role in providing critical energy infrastructure to Argentina, our history of collections on these receivables, and the 
average term that the receivables are expected to be outstanding. As a result of this analysis, the Company 
recognized an opening CECL reserve of $29 million  as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit  as of January 1, 2020.
Other financial assets  — Application of ASC 326 to the Company’s $1.5 billion  of trade accounts receivable 
and $326 million  of available-for-sale debt securities at January 1, 2020 did not result in any material adjustments, 
primarily due to the short-term duration and high turnover of these financial assets. Additionally, a large portion of 137 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
our trade accounts receivables and amounts reserved for doubtful accounts under legacy GAAP arise from 
arrangements accounted for as an operating lease under ASC 842, which are excluded from the scope of ASC 326. 
As discussed in Note 7—Financing Receivables , AES Gener recorded $33 million  of noncurrent receivables at 
December 31, 2019  pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the 
Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government in October 2019. The Company expects to collect these 
noncurrent receivables through the execution of sale agreements with third parties.  However, given the investment 
grade rating of Chile and the history of zero credit losses for regulated customers, management determined that no 
incremental CECL reserves were required to be recognized as of January 1, 2020 .

ASC 842 — Leases
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 Leases  and its subsequent corresponding updates (“ASC 
842”). Under this standard, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on the balance 
sheet, and recognize expenses in a manner similar to the prior accounting method. For lessors, the guidance 
modifies the lease classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The guidance 
eliminates previous real estate-specific provisions.
Under ASC 842, fewer of our contracts contain a lease. However, due to the elimination of the real estate-
specific guidance and changes to certain lessor classification criteria, more leases qualify as sales-type leases and 
direct financing leases. Under these two models, a lessor derecognizes the asset and recognizes a lease 
receivable. According to ASC 842, the net investment in the lease includes the fair value of residual interest in the 
asset after the contract period as well as the present value of the fixed lease payments, but does not include any 
variable payments under the lease. Therefore, the net investment in the lease could be significantly different than 
the carrying amount of the underlying asset at lease commencement. In such circumstances, the difference 
between the initially recognized net investment in the lease and the carrying amount of the underlying asset is 
recognized as a gain/loss at lease commencement.
During the course of adopting ASC 842, the Company applied various practical expedients including:
•The package of practical expedients (applied to all leases) that allowed lessees and lessors not to reassess: 
a.whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases,
b.lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and
c.whether initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases qualify for capitalization under ASC 842.
•The transition practical expedient related to land easements, allowing us to carry forward our accounting 
treatment for land easements on existing agreements, and 
•The transition practical expedient for lessees that allowed businesses to not separate lease and non-lease 
components. The Company applied the practical expedient to all classes of underlying assets when valuing 
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Contracts where the Company is the lessor were separated between 
the lease and non-lease components.138 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
The Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and elected to continue to apply the 
guidance in ASC 840 Leases  to the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. Under this transition 
method, the Company applied the transition provisions starting at the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of the 
adoption of ASC 842 on our January 1, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows (in millions):

4. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The following table presents amounts recognized related to asset retirement obligations for the periods 
indicated (in millions):

Change in estimated cash flows  3  58 
Sale of plants  (13)  (71) 
Other  —  (2) 
Balance at December 31 $ 462 $ 428 
The Company's asset retirement obligations include active ash landfills, water treatment basins and the 
removal or dismantlement of certain plants and equipment. The Company uses the cost approach to determine the 
initial value of ARO liabilities, which is estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value using 
market-based rates at the initial recording of the liabilities. Cash outflows are based on the approximate future 
disposal costs as determined by market information, historical information or other management estimates. 
Subsequent downward revisions of ARO liabilities are discounted using the market-based rates that existed when 
the liability was initially recognized. These inputs to the fair value of the ARO liabilities are considered Level 3 inputs 
under the fair value hierarchy.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company increased the asset retirement obligations and 
corresponding assets at Chile and Hawaii, by  $17 million  and $12 million , respectively, and decreased the asset 
retirement obligation at DPL by $13 million . The increase at Chile is mostly due to the initial recognition of the ARO 
at Planta Solar II. The increase at Hawaii reflects the shortened useful life of the coal plant resulting from the 
passage of Senate Bill 2629, which prohibits issuing or renewing permits for coal power plants after December 31, 140 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
2022 and calls for ceasing all coal burning for electricity generation by that date. The decrease at DPL is attributable 
to the sale of the Hutchings facility in December 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company increased the asset retirement obligation and 
corresponding asset at IPL  by $75 million  and decreased the asset retirement obligation at DPL by $87 million . The 
increase at IPL reflects an increase to estimated ash pond closure costs, including groundwater remediation as 
required by the EPA under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The decrease at DPL was attributable to 
a revision of the estimated liabilities resulting from the retirement of the Stuart and Killen facilities, and their 
subsequent transfer in December 2019.
5. FAIR VALUE
The fair value of current financial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves , and other deposits approximate 
their reported carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities have been 
determined using available market information. Because these amounts are estimates  and based on hypothetical 
transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation 
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
Valuation Techniques — The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches 
to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach, and (3) cost 
approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions 
involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert 
future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the 
return on those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to 
replace an asset. The Company measures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. 
Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and 
liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, 
plant and equipment), goodwill, and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, 
etc.). In general, the Company determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach 
and the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all 
three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often the most 
representative of fair value. 
Investments — The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and 
equity securities. Equity securities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on 
comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt securities primarily consist of unsecured debentures 
and certificates of deposit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments are generally 
indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to 
market data obtained for similar assets.  
Derivatives — Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach 
utilizing volatilities, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR and EURIBOR), foreign exchange 
rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as applicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company 
uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices for similarly traded 
instruments available in the market. 
The Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in 
certain instances the published forward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, 
and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable 
inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices. Specifically, where there 
is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company 
utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. Similarly, in 
certain instances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable, requiring the use of 
proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.
To determine the fair value of a derivative, cash flows are discounted using the relevant spot benchmark 
interest rate. The Company then makes a credit valuation adjustment ("CVA"), as applicable, by further discounting 
the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or estimated debt spread of the 
Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The CVA for potential 141 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
future scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset position is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit 
default swap spreads, and debt spreads, as available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative 
is in a liability position is based on the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of 
readily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated credit rating (based on 
applying a standard industry model to historical financial information and then considering other relevant 
information) and spreads of comparably rated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. 
All derivative instruments are analyzed individually and are subject to unique risk exposures. 
The fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. 
An input assumption is considered significant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are 
classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs is significant. When the use of unobservable inputs is 
insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 result from 
changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA. 
Debt — Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is 
estimated based on quoted market prices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated based upon interest 
rates and other features of the loan. In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debt is a close approximation of 
its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow 
("DCF") analyses. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. 
The fair value was determined using available market information as of December 31, 2020 . The Company is not 
aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2020 .
Nonrecurring measurements — For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value 
is generally determined using valuation models based on the principles of DCF. The income approach is most often 
used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangible assets, equity method investments, goodwill, and intangible 
assets. Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available for certain input assumptions, the 
Company develops its own estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and extrapolations. 
Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management 
in the valuation process.
For nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the 
sale of identical or similar assets are considered. The use of this approach is limited because it is often difficult to 
identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. This approach is used in impairment evaluations of certain 
intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach. 
For nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a 
replacement cost approach. This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is 
limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to 
corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach. 
Fair Value Considerations — In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable 
market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its 
counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are: 
Sources of market assumptions — The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient 
data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, 
management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market 
assumptions. 
Market liquidity — The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical 
instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are 
fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively 
large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a 
significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded 
without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a 
market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it 
difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction. 
Nonperformance risk — Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects 
the value at which a liability is transferred or an asset is sold. Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited 142 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
to, the Company's or its counterparty's credit and settlement risk. Nonperformance risk adjustments are dependent 
on credit spreads, letters of credit, collateral, other arrangements available, and the nature of master netting 
arrangements. The Company is party to various interest rate swaps and options, foreign currency options and 
forwards, and derivatives and embedded derivatives, which subject the Company to nonperformance risk. The 
financial and physical instruments held at the subsidiary level are generally non-recourse to the Parent Company. 
Nonperformance risk on the investments held by the Company is incorporated in the fair value derived from 
quoted market data to mark the investments to fair value.  
Recurring Measurements  — The following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy as 
described in Note 1—General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the Company's financial assets and 
liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated (in millions). For the 
Company's investments in marketable debt securities, the security classes presented were determined based on 
the nature and risk of the security and are consistent with how the Company manages, monitors, and measures its

7. FINANCING RECEIVABLES  
Receivables with contractual maturities of greater than one year are considered financing receivables. The 
following table presents financing receivables by country as of the dates indicated (in millions) . As the Company 
applied the modified retrospective method of adoption for ASC 326 effective January 1, 2020, CECL reserves are 
included in the receivable balance as of December 31, 2020 . See Note 1—General and Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies  for further information.

December 31, Gross Receivable Allowance Net Receivable Receivable
Argentina $ 48 $ 9 $ 39 $ 64 
Chile  31  —  31  33 
Other  31  —  31  12 
Total $ 110 $ 9 $ 101 $ 109 
Argentina  
Collection of the principal and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and 
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continued operation of power plants which generate cash for 
payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and amount of collections, and 
economic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentine 
government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. The Company accrues interest on 
these receivables once the recognition criteria have been met. The Company's collection estimates are based on 
assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ from 
these estimates. The decrease in Argentina financing receivables was primarily due to planned collections and 
unfavorable FX impacts.
FONINVEMEM Agreements —  As a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered 
into three  agreements with the Argentine government, referred to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a 147 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
portion of their accounts receivable into a fund for financing the construction of combined cycle and gas-fired plants. 
These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years  once the related plant 
begins operations.
The FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated in Argentine pesos, but indexed to USD, which represents a 
foreign currency derivative. Due to differences between spot rates, used to remeasure the receivables, and 
discounted forward rates, used to value the foreign currency derivative, these two items will not perfectly offset over 
the life of the receivable. Once settled, the foreign currency derivative will offset the accumulated unrealized foreign 
currency losses resulting from the devaluation of the FONINVEMEM receivable. As of December 31, 2020  and 
2019 , the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM financing 
receivables that were excluded from the table above had a fair value of $146 million  and $94 million , respectively.
The receivables under the FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plants 
commenced operations in 2010 and 2016. In assessing the collectability of the receivables under these 
agreements, the Company also considers historic collection evidence in accordance with the agreements.
Other Agreements  — Other agreements primarily consist of resolutions passed by the Argentine government in 
which AES Argentina will receive compensation for investments in new generation plants and technologies. The 
timing of collections depend on corresponding agreements and collectability of these receivables are assessed on 
an ongoing basis.
Chile
AES Gener has recorded receivables pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that 
were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government in October 2019, in conjunction with 
the Tariff Stabilization Law. Historically, the government updated the prices for these contracts every six months to 
reflect the indexation the contracts have to exchange rates and commodities prices. The Stabilization Fund does not 
allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond the pricing in effect at July 1, 
2019, until new lower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated into pricing in 2023. Consequently, costs incurred 
in excess of the July 1, 2019 price will be accumulated and borne by generators. 
On December 31, 2020, AES Gener executed an agreement for the sale of $105 million  of receivables 
generated pursuant the Tariff Stabilization Law at a discount of $20 million . As a result of the agreement, as of 
December 31, 2020 , $77 million  of current receivables and $8 million  of noncurrent receivables were recorded in 
Accounts receivable  and Other noncurrent assets , respectively, pertaining to the Stabilization Fund.  Additionally, 
$23 million  of payment deferrals granted to mining customers as part of our green blend and extend agreements 
were recorded as financing receivables included in Other noncurrent assets  at December 31, 2020 .

OPGC —  In December 2019, an other-than-temporary impairment was identified at OPGC primarily due to the 
estimated market value of the Company's investment and other negative developments impacting future expected 
cash flows at the investee . A calculation of the fair value of the Company’s investment in OPGC was required to 
evaluate whether there was a loss in the carrying value of the investment. Based on management’s estimate of fair 
value of $212 million , the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $92 million  in Other non-
operating expense  in December 2019. In March 2020, management’s updated estimate of fair value was $152 
million  and the Company recognized an additional other-than-temporary impairment of $43 million  due to the 
economic slowdown.
In June 2020, the Company agreed to sell its entire 49% stake in OPGC resulting in an additional other-than-
temporary impairment of $158 million . Total other-than-temporary impairment for the year ended December 31, 
2020  was $201 million , recognized in Other non-operating expense . In December 2020, the Company completed 
the sale for $135 million , resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $23 million , primarily due to the write-off of cumulative 
translation adjustments . Prior to its sale, the OPGC equity method investment was reported in the Eurasia SBU 
reportable segment.
Fluence  — In December 2020, Fluence entered into an agreement with the QIA whereby QIA will invest 
$125 million  in Fluence. Following the completion of the transaction, which is expected in the  second quarter of 
2021 , AES and Siemens are expected to each own approximately 44% of Fluence. The Fluence equity method 
investment is reported as part of Corporate and Other.
Guacolda —  In October 2019, Guacolda management reviewed the recoverability of the Guacolda asset group 
and determined the undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying amount. Guacolda recognized a long-lived 
asset impairment at the investee level, which negatively impacted the Company's Net equity in earnings (losses) of 
affiliates  by $158 million .
 In September 2020, Guacolda management identified additional impairment indicators primarily as a result of 
inability to re-contract Guacolda’s generation after expiration of its existing PPAs driven by lower energy prices in 
Chile and reduced forecasted cash flows resulting from decarbonization initiatives of the Chilean Government. 
Guacolda recognized a long-lived asset impairment at the investee level, which negatively impacted the Company's 
Net equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates  by $127 million . As a result, the Company’s basis in its investment in 
Guacolda was reduced to zero and the equity method of accounting was suspended. As of December 31, 2020 , the 
Company has not recognized  $99 million  of equity method losses which were in excess of the Company’s carrying 
amount. The Guacolda equity method investment is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.
Energía Natural Dominicana Enadom  — In September 2019, AES Andres established a joint venture with 
Energas Group for the purpose of selling natural gas and related terminal services, storage, regasification, and 
transportation to customers in the Dominican Republic. Gas Natural del Este (subsequently renamed Energía 
Natural Dominicana Enadom), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the joint venture, acquired the Eastern Pipeline 
development project from AES Andres for total consideration of $55 million , resulting in a gain of $2 million . The 
transaction was considered a contribution of a nonfinancial asset in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in the 
joint venture. As the Company does not control the joint venture, it is accounted for as an equity method investment 
and is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.
Uplight  — In July 2019, Simple Energy merged with Tendril, a previously unrelated party, to form Uplight, a 
new company that offers a comprehensive platform for utility customer engagement. As part of this merger, the 
Company contributed its ownership interest in Simple Energy and $53 million  of cash in exchange for an ownership 
interest in the merged company. This transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $12 million  and a total investment in 
Uplight of $98 million . As the Company does not control Uplight, it is accounted for as an equity method investment 
and is reported as part of Corporate and Other.
sPower — In April 2019, the Company closed on the sale of approximately 48% of its interest in a portfolio of 
sPower’s operating assets for $173 million , subject to customary purchase price adjustments, of which $58 million  
was used to pay down debt at sPower. This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of business interests of $28 
million . After the sale, the Company’s ownership interest in this portfolio of sPower’s operating assets decreased 
from 50% to approximately 26%. The sPower equity method investment is reported in the US and Utilities SBU 
reportable segment.
Barry — The Company holds a 100%  ownership interest in AES Barry Ltd. ("Barry"), a dormant entity in the 
U.K. that disposed of its generation and other operating assets. Due to a debt agreement, no material financial or 149 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
operating decisions can be made without the banks' consent, and the Company does not control Barry. As of 
December 31, 2020  and 2019 , other long-term liabilities included $46 million  and $44 million  related to this debt 
agreement.

(1)Past expenditures on which the Company earns a rate of return .
Our regulatory assets and current regulatory liabilities  primarily consist of  under or overcollection of costs that 
are generally non-controllable, such as purchased electricity, energy transmission, fuel costs, and other sector 
costs. These costs are recoverable or refundable as defined by the laws and regulations in our markets. Our 
regulatory assets also include defined pension and postretirement benefit obligations equal to the previously 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs that are expected to be recovered through future 
rates. Additionally, our regulatory assets include the expected carrying value of IPL's Petersburg Unit 1 at its 
anticipated retirement date, which will be amortized over the life of the asset beginning on the date of retirement . 
Other current and noncurrent regulatory assets primarily consist of :
•Undercollections on rate riders such as wholesale margin sharing and MISO costs at IPL and energy 
efficiency and storm costs at DPL;
•Unamortized premiums reacquired or redeemed on long-term debt at IPL and DPL, which are amortized over 
the lives of the original issuances; and
•OVEC costs at DPL.
Our noncurrent regulatory liabilities primarily consist of obligations for removal costs which do not have an 
associated legal retirement obligation. Our noncurrent regulatory liabilities also include deferred income taxes 
related to differences in income recognition between tax laws and accounting methods, which will be passed 
through to our regulated customers via a decrease in future retail rates.
In the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets, current regulatory assets and liabilities are reflected in 
Other current assets  and Accrued and other liabilities , respectively, and noncurrent regulatory assets and liabilities 
are reflected in Other noncurrent assets  and Other noncurrent liabilities , respectively. All of the regulatory assets 
and liabilities as of December 31, 2020  and December 31, 2019  are related to the US and Utilities SBU .152 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018

for a fixed rate loan with a newly formed SPV, accounted for as an equity affiliate, due in 2029 with interest rates 154 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
that vary from 4.41%  to 7.18% . This refinancing was a non-cash transaction as the SPV acquired all of the 
outstanding rights and obligations of the original Mong Duong lenders. As a result of these transactions, the 
Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $31 million . As of December 31, 2020 , Mong Duong met 
the held-for-sale criteria and the outstanding debt balances were reclassified to held-for-sale liabilities on the

Non-Recourse Debt Covenants, Restrictions and Defaults — The terms of the Company's non-recourse debt 
include certain financial and nonfinancial covenants. These covenants are limited to subsidiary activity and vary 
among the subsidiaries. These covenants may include, but are not limited to, maintenance of certain reserves and 
financial ratios, minimum levels of working capital and limitations on incurring additional indebtedness.
As of December 31, 2020  and 2019 , approximately $587 million  and $372 million , respectively, of restricted 
cash was maintained in accordance with certain covenants of the non-recourse debt agreements, and these 
amounts were included within Restricted cash  and Debt service reserves and other deposits  in the accompanying 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Various lender and governmental provisions restrict the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries to 
transfer their net assets to the Parent Company. Such restricted net assets of subsidiaries amounted to 
approximately $1.7 billion  at December 31, 2020 .
The following table summarizes the Company's subsidiary non-recourse debt in default (in millions) as of 
December 31, 2020 . Due to the defaults, these amounts are included in the current portion of non-recourse debt:
Primary Nature

Subsidiary Debt in Default Net Assets
AES Puerto Rico Covenant $ 238 $ 171 
AES Ilumina (Puerto Rico) Covenant  31  19 
AES Jordan Solar Covenant  7  1 
Total $ 276 
The above defaults are not payment defaults. In Puerto Rico, the subsidiary non-recourse debt defaults were 
triggered by failure to comply with covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents 
due to the bankruptcy of the offtaker.
The AES Corporation's recourse debt agreements include cross-default clauses that will trigger if a subsidiary 
or group of subsidiaries for which the non-recourse debt is in default provides 20% or more of the Parent 
Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of 
December 31, 2020 , the Company had no defaults which resulted in or were at risk of triggering a cross-default 
under the recourse debt of the Parent Company. In the event the Parent Company is not in compliance  with the 
financial covenants of its revolving credit facility, restricted payments will be limited to regular quarterly shareholder 
dividends at the then-prevailing rate. Payment defaults and bankruptcy defaults would preclude the making of any 
restricted payments.155 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018

During the first quarter of 2020, the Company drew $840 million  on revolving lines of credit at the Parent 
Company, of which approximately $250 million  was used to enhance our liquidity position due to the uncertain 
economic conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and the remaining $590 million  was used for other 
general corporate purposes. During the remainder of 2020, the Parent Company drew an additional $755 million  
and repaid $1.5 billion  on these revolving lines of credit. The entire $250 million  related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
was repaid during the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020 , we had approximately $70 million  of 
outstanding indebtedness on the Parent Company credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 1.86% . 
In May 2020, the Company issued $900 million  aggregate principal of 3.30%  senior unsecured notes due in 
2025  and $700 million  of 3.95%  senior unsecured notes due in 2030 . The Company used the net proceeds from 
these issuances to purchase via tender offer a portion of the 4.00% , 4.50% , and 4.875%  senior notes due in 2021 , 
2023 , and 2023 , respectively. Subsequent to the tender offers, the Company redeemed the remaining balance of its 
4.00%  and 4.875%  senior notes due in 2021  and 2023 , respectively, and $7 million  of the remaining 4.50%  senior 
notes due in 2023 . As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 
$37 million .
In December 2020, the Company issued $800 million  aggregate principal of 1.375%  senior unsecured notes 
due in 2026  and $1 billion  aggregate principal of 2.45%  senior unsecured notes due in 2031 . The Company used 
the net proceeds from these issuances to purchase via tender offer the remaining balance of its 5.50% , 6.00% , and 
5.125%  senior notes due 2025 , 2026 , and 2027 , respectively. Subsequent to the tender offers, the Company 
redeemed the remaining balance of its 4.50%  and 5.50%  notes due 2023  and 2024 , respectively.  As a result of 
these transactions, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $108 million .

senior secured term loan due in 2022  and $100 million  of its 4.875%  senior unsecured notes due in 2023 . As a 
result of these transactions, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5 million .156 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
Recourse Debt Covenants and Guarantees — The Company's obligations under the revolving credit facility 
and indentures governing the senior notes due 2025 and 2030 are currently unsecured following the achievement of 
two investment grade ratings and the release of security in accordance with the terms of the facility and the notes. If 
the Company’s credit rating falls below "Investment Grade" from at least two of Fitch Investors Service Inc., 
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., as determined in accordance with the terms 
of the revolving credit facility and indenture dated May 15, 2020 (BBB-, or in the case of Moody’s Investor Services, 
Inc. Baa3), then the obligations under the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes due 
2025 and 2030 become, subject to certain exceptions, secured by (i) all of the capital stock of domestic subsidiaries 
owned directly by the Company or certain subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
owned directly by the Company and certain subsidiaries,and (ii) certain intercompany receivables, certain 
intercompany notes and certain intercompany tax sharing agreements.
The revolving credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, including the sale 
of certain assets. In such a situation, a portion of the net cash proceeds from the sale must be applied pro rata to 
repay loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility and certain other indebtedness, if any, subject to 
customary reinvestment rights.
The revolving credit facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on the Company's ability to engage 
in certain activities, including, but not limited to, limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and 
guarantees; limitations on restricted payments such as shareholder dividends and equity repurchases; restrictions 
on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet or derivative 
arrangements; and other financial reporting requirements.
The revolving credit facility also contains financial covenants, evaluated quarterly, requiring the Company to 
maintain a minimum ratio of adjusted operating cash flow to interest charges on recourse debt of 2.5 times and a 
maximum ratio of recourse debt to adjusted operating cash flow of 5.75 times.
The terms of the Company's senior notes contain certain customary covenants, including limitations on the 
Company's ability to incur liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions.
12. COMMITMENTS
The Company enters into long-term contracts for construction projects, maintenance and service, transmission 
of electricity, operations services and purchases of electricity and fuel. In general, these contracts are subject to 
variable quantities or prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances. The following table shows the future 
minimum commitments for continuing operations under these contracts as of December 31,  2020  for 2021  through 
2025  and thereafter as well as a ctual purchases under these contracts for the years ended December 31,  2020 ,

13. CONTINGENCIES 
Guarantees and Letters of Credit — In connection with certain project financings, acquisitions and 
dispositions, power purchases, and other agreements, the Parent Company has expressly undertaken limited 
obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of 
future events. In the normal course of business, the Parent Company has entered into various agreements, mainly 
guarantees and letters of credit, to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties  on behalf of AES 
businesses. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise 
achieved by a business on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accomplish 157 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
their intended business purposes. Most of the contingent obligations relate to future performance commitments 
which the Company or its businesses expect to fulfill within the normal course of business. The expiration dates of 
these guarantees vary from less than one year to no more than 15 years .
The following table summarizes the Parent Company's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 
2020 . Amounts presented in the following table represent the Parent Company's current undiscounted exposure to 
guarantees and the range of maximum undiscounted potential exposure. The maximum exposure is not reduced by 
the amounts, if any, that could be recovered under the recourse or collateralization provisions in the guarantees. 
There were 5 obligations made by the Parent Company for the direct benefit of the lenders associated with the non-
recourse debt of its businesses.
Contingent Contractual Obligations Amount (in millions)Number of 
AgreementsMaximum Exposure Range for 
Each Agreement (in millions)
Guarantees and commitments $ 1,358 69 $0 — 157

Letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  77 17 $0 — 62
Surety bond  1 1 $1
Total $ 1,546 112
During the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 1% to 3% per 
annum on the outstanding amounts of letters of credit.
Environmental — The Company periodically reviews its obligations as they relate to compliance with 
environmental laws, including site restoration and remediation. For the periods ended December 31, 2020  and 
2019 , the Company recognized liabilities of $5 million  and $4 million  for projected environmental remediation costs, 
respectively. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future 
costs of compliance or remediation could be higher or lower than the amount currently accrued. Moreover, where no 
liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that the Company may be required to incur remediation costs 
or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2020 . In 
aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses related to environmental matters, where estimable, 
to be up to $12 million . The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include amounts accrued as discussed 
above. 
Litigation — The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of 
business. The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and 
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company has recognized aggregate liabilities for all claims of 
approximately $28 million  and $55 million  as of December 31, 2020  and 2019 , respectively. These amounts are 
reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities  and Other noncurrent liabilities . A 
significant portion of these accrued liabilities relate to regulatory matters and commercial disputes in international 
jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and 
future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.
Where no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided 
unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that 
could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2020 . The material contingencies where a loss is 
reasonably possible primarily include disputes with offtakers, suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged breaches of 
contract; alleged violation of laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and 
regulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses, where estimable, related to 
these reasonably possible material contingencies to be between $245 million  and $933 million . The amounts 
considered reasonably possible do not include the amounts accrued, as discussed above. These material 
contingencies do not include income tax-related contingencies which are considered part of our uncertain tax 
positions.
Tietê GSF Settlement  — In December 2020, ANEEL published a regulation establishing the terms and 
conditions for compensation to Tietê for the non-hydrological risk charged to hydro generators through the incorrect 
application of the GSF mechanism from 2013 until 2018. In accordance with the regulation, this compensation will 
be in the form of a concession extension period of approximately 2.6 years . As a result, the previously recognized 
contingent liabilities related to GSF payments were updated to reflect the Company's best estimate for the fair value 
of compensation to be received from the concession extension offered in conjunction with the regulation. This 
compensation was estimated to have a fair value of $184 million , and was recorded as a reversal of Non-Regulated  
Cost of Sales  on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The concession extension also met the criteria for 158 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
recognition as a definite-lived intangible asset, which will be amortized from the date of the agreement until the end 
of the new concession period. The value of the concession extension is based on a preliminary time-value 
equivalent calculation made by the CCEE and subsequent adjustments requested by Tietê, which has been 
determined to be fair value. Both the concession extension period and its equivalent asset value are subject to a 
final agreement between ANEEL and AES.

LESSOR — The Company has operating leases for certain generation contracts that contain provisions to 
provide capacity to a customer, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer. 
Capacity payments are generally considered lease elements as they cover the majority of available output from a 
facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of 
the lease. Lease payments from such contracts are recognized as lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term, whereas variable lease payments are recognized when earned.

The option to extend or terminate a lease is based on customary early termination provisions in the contract,  
such as payment defaults, bankruptcy, and lack of performance on energy delivery.  The Company has not 
recognized any early terminations as of December 31, 2020 . Certain leases may provide for variable lease 
payments based on usage or index-based (e.g., the U.S. Consumer Price Index) adjustments to lease payments.

Battery Storage Lease Arrangements  — The Company is constructing and operating projects that pair BESS 
with solar energy systems, which allows the project more flexibility on when to provide energy to the grid. The 
Company will enter into PPAs for the full output of the facility that allow customers the ability to determine when to 
charge and discharge the BESS. These arrangements include both lease and non-lease elements under ASC 842, 
with the BESS component constituting a sales-type lease. Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the 160 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
leased asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on 
the present value of fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the underlying asset. Due to the 
variable nature of lease payments under these contracts, the Company recorded losses  at commencement of sales-
type leases of $36 million  for the year ended December 31, 2019 . These amounts are recognized in Other expense  
in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 21—Other Income and Expense  for further information.  The 
Company recognized lease income on sales-type leases through variable payments of $5 million  and interest 
income of $2 million  for the year ended December 31, 2020 .
15. BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Contribution Plan — The Company sponsors four defined contribution plans ("the DC Plans"). Two 
plans cover U.S. non-union employees; one for Parent Company and certain US and Utilities SBU business 
employees, and one for DPL employees. The remaining two plans include union and non-union employees at IPL 
and union employees at DPL. The DC Plans are qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. Most 
U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the appropriate plan except for those employees who 
are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is 
considered an eligible employee under a plan. Within the DC Plans, the Company provides matching contributions 
in addition to other non-matching contributions. Participants are fully vested in their own contributions. The 
Company's contributions vest over various time periods ranging from immediate up to five years . For the years 
ended December 31, 2020 , 2019  and 2018 , costs for defined contribution plans were approximately $21 million , $19 
million  and $21 million , respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans — Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering 
substantially all of their respective employees ("the DB Plans"). Pension benefits are based on years of credited 
service, age of the participant, and average earnings. Of the 28 active DB Plans as of December 31, 2020 , five are 
at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries .

____________________________ _
(1)Includes an inflation factor that is used to calculate future periodic benefit cost, but is not used to calculate the benefit obligation .
The Company establishes its estimated long-term return on plan assets considering various factors, which 
include the targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns.
The measurement of pension obligations, costs, and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. These 
assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, 
taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic 
experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.
The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates, 
salary growth, retirement rates, inflation, expected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. The effects of actual 
results differing from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, 
therefore, generally affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods. Unrecognized gains or losses 
are amortized using the “corridor approach,” under which the net gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of the 
projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets, if applicable, is amortized.
Sensitivity of the Company's pension funded status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate 
and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions is shown below. Note that these sensitivities may be 
asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2020 . They also may not be additive, so the impact 
of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. 
The funded status as of December 31, 2020  is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 
2020  is affected by the December 31, 2019  assumptions. The impact on pension expense from a one percentage 
point change in these assumptions is shown in the following table (in millions):

The U.S. DB Plans seek to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:
•maintenance of sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits and other lump sum payments;
•long-term rate of return in excess of the annualized inflation rate;
•long-term rate of return, net of relevant fees, that meets or exceeds the assumed actuarial rate; and
•long-term competitive rate of return on investments, net of expenses, that equals or exceeds various 
benchmark rates.
The asset allocation is reviewed periodically to determine a suitable asset allocation which seeks to manage 
risk through portfolio diversification and takes into account the above-stated objectives, in conjunction with current 
funding levels, cash flow conditions, and economic and industry trends. The following table summarizes the 
Company's U.S. DB Plan assets by category of investment and level within the fair value hierarchy as of the periods

Colon  — Our partner in Colon made capital contributions of $10 million  during the year ended December 31, 
2019 . No contributions were made in 2020.  Any subsequent adjustments to allocate earnings and dividends to our 
partner, or measure the investment at fair value, will be classified as temporary equity each reporting period as it is 
probable that the shares will become redeemable.
IPL — IPL had $60 million  of cumulative preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2020  and 2019 , which 
represents five series of preferred stock. The total annual dividend requirements were approximately $3 million  at 
December 31, 2020  and 2019 . Certain series of the preferred stock were redeemable solely at the option of the 
issuer at prices between $100  and $118  per share. Holders of the preferred stock are entitled to elect a majority of 
IPL's board of directors if IPL has not paid dividends to its preferred stockholders for four consecutive quarters. 
Based on the preferred stockholders' ability to elect a majority of IPL's board of directors in this circumstance, the 164 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
redemption of the preferred shares is considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred 
stock is considered temporary equity.  
17. EQUITY
Equity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interes ts
Southland  Energy  — In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of 35% of its ownership interest in 
the Southland Energy assets for $424 million , which decreased the Company's economic interest to 65%. However, 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company is entitled to all earnings or losses  until March 
1, 2021, and any distributions related thereto . This transaction resulted in a $275 million  increase in Parent 
Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $266 million , net of tax and 
transaction costs, and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from AOCL to NCI of $9 
million . As the Company maintained control after the sale, Southland Energy continues to be consolidated by the 
Company within the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.
Cochrane  — In September 2020, AES Gener completed the sale of a portion of its stake in Cochrane. The 
transaction included the issuance of preferred shares and the sale of 5% of its stake in the subsidiary for $113 
million , which decreased the Company’s economic interest in Cochrane to 38%. The preferred shareholders have 
the preferential right to receive an annual amount equal to $12 million , from any dividends or distributions of capital, 
until reaching the original investment of $113 million  plus a specified rate of return. In November 2020, Cochrane 
distributed $12 million  to the preferred shareholders. As the Company maintained control after the sale, Cochrane 
continues to be consolidated by the Company within the South America SBU reportable segment.
AES Brasil  — In August 2020, AES Holdings Brasil Ltda. ("AHB") completed the acquisition of an additional 
18.5%  ownership in AES Brasil for $240 million . During the fourth quarter of 2020 , through multiple transactions, 
AHB acquired another 1.3%  ownership in AES Brasil for $16 million . In aggregate, these transactions increased the 
Company’s economic interest in AES Brasil to 44.1%  and resulted in a $214 million  decrease in Parent Company 
Stockholders’ Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $94 million  and the reclassification of 
accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $120 million . AES Brasil is reported in the South 
America SBU reportable segment.
Distributed Energy — In 2020 , 2019  and 2018 , Distributed Energy, through multiple transactions, sold 
noncontrolling interests in multiple project companies to tax equity partners. These transactions resulted in a $144 
million , $133 million , and $98 million  increase to noncontrolling interest in 2020 , 2019 , and 2018  respectively. 
Distributed Energy is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.

18. SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 
The segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to 
reflect how the Company manages the businesses internally and is mainly organized by geographic regions which 
provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business. The management reporting structure is 
organized by four SBUs led by our President and Chief Executive Officer: US and Utilities, South America, MCAC, 
and Eurasia SBUs. Using the accounting guidance on segment reporting, the Company determined that its four 
operating segments are aligned with its four reportable segments corresponding to its SBUs. 
Corporate and Other  — Included in "Corporate and Other" are the results of the AES self-insurance company 
and certain equity affiliates, corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our 
four reportable segments, and certain intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully 
eliminated in consolidation.
The Company uses Adjusted PTC as its primary segment performance measure. Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP 
measure, is defined by the Company as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES 
Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to  (a) unrealized gains or losses related to 
derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, 
benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, 
and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, 
losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt;  (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, 
including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; and (g) net gains at 
Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with 
Minera Escondida and Minera Spence . Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax 
basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.  The Company has concluded 
Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant 
measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Additionally, 
given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more 
transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the 
Company's results. 
Revenue and Adjusted PTC are presented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of 
intercompany transactions with other segments except for interest, charges for certain management fees, and the 
write-off of intercompany balances, as applicable. All intra-segment activity has been eliminated within the segment. 
Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results.

19. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIO N
RESTRICTED STOCK
Restricted Stock Units — The Company issues RSUs under its long-term compensation plan. The RSUs are 
generally granted based upon a percentage of the participant's base salary. The units have a three -year vesting 
schedule and vest in one-third increments over the three -year period. In all circumstances, RSUs granted by AES 
do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the RSU in cash or other assets of AES.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 , RSUs issued had a grant date fair value equal to 
the closing price of the Company's stock on the grant date. The Company does not discount the grant date fair 
values to reflect any post-vesting restrictions. RSUs granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 
2020 , 2019 , and 2018  had grant date fair values per RSU of $20.75 , $17.53 , and $10.55 , respectively.
The following table summarizes the components of the Company's stock-based compensation related to its 
employee RSUs recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements (in millions):

Cash was not used to settle RSUs or compensation cost capitalized as part of the cost of an asset for the 
years ended December 31, 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 . As of December 31, 2020 , total unrecognized compensation cost 
related to RSUs of $12 million  is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.8 
years . There were no modifications to RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2020 .
A summary of the activity of RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020  follows (RSUs in thousands):
RSUsWeighted Average

Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2020  1,104 $ 17.35 
The Company initially recognizes compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the 
requisite service is expected to be rendered. In 2020 , AES has estimated a weighted average forfeiture rate of 
7.23%  for RSUs granted in 2020 . This estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual 
number of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimated forfeiture rate, the 
Company expects to expense $11 million  on a straight-line basis over a three-year period.
The following table summarizes the RSUs that vested and were converted during the periods indicated (RSUs 
in thousands):

OTHER SHARE BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has three other share-based award programs. The Company has recorded expenses of $21 
million , $22 million , and $20 million  for 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 , respectively, related to these programs. 
Stock options — AES grants options to purchase shares of common stock under stock option plans to non-
employee directors. Under the terms of the plans, the Company may issue options to purchase shares of the 
Company's common stock at a price equal to 100%  of the market price at the date the option is granted. Stock 
options issued in 2018 , 2019 , and 2020  have a three -year vesting schedule and vest in one-third increments over 
the three -year period. The stock options have a contractual term of 10 years . In all circumstances, stock options 
granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock option in cash or other assets 
of AES.
Performance Stock Units — In 2018 , 2019 , and 2020 , the Company issued PSUs to officers under its long-
term compensation plan. PSUs are stock units which include performance conditions. Performance conditions are 
based on the Company's Proportional Free Cash Flow targets for 2018  and 2019 . For 2020 , performance conditions 
are based on the Company’s Parent Free Cash Flow target. The performance conditions determine the vesting and 
final share equivalent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of 0% to 200% , depending on the 
achievement. The Company believes it is probable that the performance condition will be met and will continue to 
be evaluated throughout the performance period. In all circumstances, PSUs granted by AES do not entitle the 
holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock units in cash or other assets of AES .
Performance Cash Units  — In 2018 , 2019 , and 2020 , the Company issued PCUs to its officers under its long-
term compensation plan. The value of the 2018 and 2019 units is dependent on the market condition of total 
stockholder return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholder return of the Standard and 
Poor's 500 Utilities Sector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and MSCI Emerging Market Index over a three -
year measurement period. The value for the 2020 units is dependent on the market condition of total stockholder 
return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholder return of the Standard and Poor's 500 Utilities 
Sector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index over a three-year 
measurement period. Since PCUs are settled in cash, they qualify for liability accounting and periodic measurement 
is required.  170 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018

Contract Balances — The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts 
receivable and contract liabilities. The contract liabilities from contracts with customers were $531 million  and $117 
million  as of December 31, 2020  and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2020  and 2019 , we recognized revenue of $14 million  and $13 million , 
respectively, that was included in the corresponding contract liability balance at the beginning of the periods.
In August 2020, AES Gener reached an agreement with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence to early 
terminate two PPAs of the Angamos coal-fired plant in Chile, further accelerating AES Gener's decarbonization 
strategy. As a result of the termination payment, Angamos recognized a contract liability of $655 million , of which 
$55 million  will be derecognized each month through the end of the remaining performance obligation in August 
2021. As of December 31, 2020 , the remaining contract liability is $383 million . 
A significant financing arrangement exists for our Mong Duong plant in Vietnam. The plant was constructed 
under a BOT contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25 year PPA. 
The performance obligation to construct the facility was substantially completed in 2015. Approximately $1.4 billion  
of contract consideration related to the construction, but not yet collected through the 25 year PPA, was reflected as 171 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
a loan receivable as of December 31, 2019 . As of December 31, 2020 , Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria 
and the loan receivable balance of $1.3 billion , net of CECL reserve of $32 million , was reclassified to held-for-sale 
assets . Of the loan receivable balance, $80 million  was classified as Current held-for-sale as sets and $1.2 billion  
was classified as Noncurrent held-for-sale assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Remaining Performance Obligations — The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations 
represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the 
reporting period. As of December 31, 2020 , the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining 
performance obligations was $11 million , primarily consisting of fixed consideration for the sale of renewable energy 
credits in long-term contracts in the U.S. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately one-fifth of the 
remaining performance obligations in 2021 and 2022, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
21. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE
Other income generally includes gains on insurance recoveries in excess of property damage, gains on asset 
sales and liability extinguishments, favorable judgments on contingencies, allowance for funds used during 
construction, and other income from miscellaneous transactions. Other expense generally includes losses on asset 
sales and dispositions, losses on legal contingencies, defined benefit plan non-service costs, and losses from other

AES Gener  — In August 2020, AES Gener reached an agreement with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence 
to early terminate two PPAs of the Angamos coal-fired plant in Chile, further accelerating AES Gener’s 
decarbonization strategy. AES Gener also announced its intention to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 1 
and Ventanas 2 coal-fired plants. Management will no longer be pursuing a contracting strategy for these assets 
and the plants will primarily be utilized as peaker plants and for grid stability. Due to these developments, the 
Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amounts of these asset groups were 172 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
not recoverable. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $781 million . AES Gener is 
reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.
Hawaii — During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived coal-fired 
asset in Hawaii. Uncertainty around the ability to contract the asset upon expiration of its existing PPA resulted in 
management's decision to reassess the economic useful life of the generation facility. A decrease in the useful life 
was identified as an impairment indicator and the Company determined that the carrying amount was not 
recoverable. The asset group, consisting of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, was determined to 
have a fair value of $103 million  using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment 
expense of $60 million  as of December 31, 2019. 
In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature passed Senate Bill 2629 which will prohibit AES Hawaii from 
generating electricity from coal after December 31, 2022. Therefore, management further reassessed the economic 
useful life of the generation facility and a decrease in the useful life was identified as an impairment indicator. The 
Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not 
recoverable. As a result, the Company recognized additional asset impairment expense of $38 million  during the 
third quarter of 2020 . Hawaii is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.
Estrella del Mar I — In August 2020, the Estrella del Mar I power barge was disconnected from the Panama 
grid and AES Panama is currently evaluating its options for the asset. Upon disconnection, the Company concluded 
that the barge was no longer part of the AES Panama asset group and performed an impairment analysis. The 
Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset was not recoverable and recognized asset impairment 
expense of $30 million . The asset met the held-for-sale criteria as of December 31, 2020. See Note 25—Held-for-
Sale and Dispositions  for further information. Estrella del Mar I is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.
Kilroot and Ballylumford — In April 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its entire 100% 
interest in the Kilroot coal and oil-fired plant and energy storage facility and the Ballylumford gas-fired plant in the 
United Kingdom. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the Company performed an impairment analysis and 
determined that the carrying value of the asset group of $232 million  was greater than its fair value less costs to sell 
of $114 million . As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $115 million . The Company 
completed the sale of Kilroot and Ballylumford in June 2019. See Note 25—Held-for-Sale and Dispositions  for 
further information. Prior to their sale, Kilroot and Ballylumford were reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable 
segment.
Shady Point — In December 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Shady Point, a coal-fired 
generation facility in the U.S. Due first to the uncertainty around future cash flows, and then upon meeting the held-
for-sale criteria, the Company performed an impairment analysis of the Shady Point asset group in the second, third 
and fourth quarters of 2018, resulting in the recognition of total asset impairment expense of $157 million  for the 
year ended December 31, 2018. Using the market approach, the asset group was determined to have a fair value of 
$30 million  as of December 31, 2018. The sale was completed in May 2019. See Note 25—Held-for-Sale and 
Dispositions  for further information. Prior to the sale, Shady Point was reported in the US and Utilities SBU 
reportable segment.
Nejapa  — During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at 
Nejapa, a landfill gas plant in El Salvador. Decreased production as a result of the landfill owner's failure to perform 
improvements necessary to continue extracting gas from the landfill was identified as an impairment indicator. The 
Company determined that the carrying amount was not recoverable. The asset group, consisting of property, plant, 
and equipment and intangible assets, was determined to have a fair value of $5 million  using the income approach. 
As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $37 million  as of December 31, 2018. Nejapa is 
reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.173 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018

Effective and Statutory Rate Reconciliation — The following table summarizes a reconciliation of the 
U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate as a percentage of income from continuing 
operations before taxes for the periods indicated:
December 31, 2020 2019 2018
Statutory Federal tax rate  21 %  21 %  21 %
State taxes, net of Federal tax benefit  (6) %  6 %  2 %
Taxes on foreign earnings  15 %  12 %  9 %
Valuation allowance  16 %  (2) %  (2) %
Change in tax law  3 %  (1) %  6 %
US Investment Tax Credit  (8) %  — %  — %
Other—net  3 %  (1) %  (1) %
Effective tax rate  44 %  35 %  35 %
For 2020, the 15% taxes on foreign earnings item includes $20 million  of tax benefit associated with the 
Company's equity investment in Guacolda. Included in the 2020 (8)%  U.S. investment tax credit is $35 million  of 
benefit associated with the Na Pua Makani wind facility. Not included in the 2020 effective tax rate is $75 million  of 
income tax expense recorded to additional paid-in-capital related to the Company's sale of 35% of its ownership 
interest in the Southland Energy assets. See Note 17—Equity  for details of the sale.
For 2019, the 12% taxes on foreign earnings item includes $19 million  of tax benefit associated with the 
Company's equity investment in Guacolda. Included in the 2019 change in tax law amount of (1)%  are the 
downward adjustments to the U.S. one-time transition tax expense and deferred tax remeasurement benefit 
resulting from the issuance of the final regulations in 2019, offset by the impact of deferred tax remeasurement 
expense related to the December 2019 Argentina tax law change.
For 2018, the 6% change in tax law item relates primarily to changes in estimate under SAB 118 of the impacts 
of adoption of the TCJA. The Company recognized tax expense of $194 million  related to revised estimates of the 
one-time transition tax in accordance with proposed regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in 2018. The 
adjustment was due in large part to the approach the proposed regulations adopted to determine the fair value of 
our interests in publicly traded subsidiaries. The Company also recognized tax benefit of $77 million  related to 
revised estimates of deferred tax remeasurement. Included in the 9% taxes on foreign earnings item is $124 million  
of U.S. GILTI tax expense related to foreign subsidiaries, including the sale of our interest in Masinloc.
Income Tax Receivables and Payables — The current income taxes receivable and payable are included in 
Other Current Assets  and Accrued and Other Liabilities , respectively, on the accompanying Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. The noncurrent income taxes receivable and payable are included in Other Noncurrent Assets  and Other 
Noncurrent Liabilities , respectively, on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table 
summarizes the income taxes receivable and payable as of the periods indicated (in millions):
December 31, 2020 2019
Income taxes receivable—current $ 138 $ 131 
Income taxes receivable—noncurrent  9  10 
Total income taxes receivable $ 147 $ 141 
Income taxes payable—current $ 284 $ 172 
Income taxes payable—noncurrent  —  — 
Total income taxes payable $ 284 $ 172 
Deferred Income Taxes — Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 174 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
income tax purposes and (b) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. These items are stated at the enacted 
tax rates that are expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
As of December 31, 2020 , the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax return purposes of 
approximately $2.1 billion , of which approximately $950 million  expire in years 2033 to 2036 and $1.2 billion  carry 
forward indefinitely. The Company also had federal general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $66 
million , of which $16 million  expire in years 2021 to 2031 and $50 million  expire in years 2032 to 2040. Additionally, 
the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2020  of approximately $7.3 billion  
expiring primarily in years 2021 to 2040. As of December 31, 2020 , the Company had foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion  that expire at various times beginning in 2021 and some of which carry 
forward without expiration, and tax credits available in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $14 million , $13 million  
of which expire in 2021.
Valuation allowances decreased  $190 million  during 2020  to $634 million  at December 31, 2020 . This net 
decrease was primarily the result of valuation allowance activity due to the liquidation of certain holding companies 
with net operating losses with full valuation allowances.
Valuation allowances decreased  $44 million  during 2019  to $824 million  at December 31, 2019 . This net 
decrease was primarily the result of valuation allowance activity at certain of our Brazil subsidiaries and U.S. states.
The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets as shown below will be 
realized when future taxable income is generated through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and 
income that is expected to be generated by businesses that have long-term contracts or a history of generating 
taxable income. 
The following table summarizes deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the periods indicated (in millions):
December 31, 2020 2019
Differences between book and tax basis of property $ (1,308) $ (1,426) 
Investment in U.S. tax partnerships  (332)  (44)

Net deferred tax liability $ (812) $ (1,057) 
The Company considers undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested 
outside of the U.S. Except for the one-time transition tax in the U.S., no taxes have been recorded with respect to 
our indefinitely reinvested earnings in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. Should 
the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state 
income taxes. Under the TCJA, future distributions from foreign subsidiaries will generally be subject to a federal 
dividends received deduction in the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative amount of U.S. GAAP foreign 
un-remitted earnings upon which additional income taxes have not been provided is approximately $4 billion . It is 
not practicable to estimate the amount of any additional taxes which may be payable on the undistributed earnings.
Income from operations in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates as a result of satisfying specific 
commitments regarding employment and capital investment. The Company's income tax benefits related to the tax 
status of these operations are estimated to be $33 million , $26 million  and $35 million  for the years ended 
December 31, 2020 , 2019  and 2018 , respectively. The per share effect of these benefits after noncontrolling 
interests was $0.03 , $0.02  and $0.04  for the years ended December 31, 2020 , 2019  and 2018 , respectively. 
Included in the Company's income tax benefits is the benefit related to our operations in Vietnam, which is 
estimated to be $16 million , $13 million  and $19 million  for the years ended December 31, 2020 , 2019  and 2018 , 
respectively. The per share effect of these benefits related to our operations in Vietnam after noncontrolling interest 
was $0.01 , $0.01  and $0.01  for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.175 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018

Uncertain Tax Positions — Uncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities 
unless they are expected to be paid within one year. The Company's policy for interest and penalties related to 
income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The following table shows the total amount of gross accrued income taxes

We are potentially subject to income tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally until the 
applicable statute of limitations expires. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years 
to complete. The following is a summary of tax years potentially subject to examination in the significant tax and 
business jurisdictions in which we operate:
Jurisdiction Tax Years Subject to Examination
Argentina 2014-2020
Brazil 2015-2020
Chile 2017-2020
Colombia 2016-2020
Dominican Republic 2015-2020
El Salvador 2017-2020
Netherlands 2014-2020
Panama 2017-2020
United Kingdom 2017-2020
United States (Federal) 2017-2020
As of December 31, 2020 , 2019  and 2018 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $458 million , 
$465 million  and $463 million , respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would benefit the 
effective tax rate as of December 31, 2020 , 2019  and 2018  is $439 million , $448 million  and $446 million , 
respectively, of which $33 million  for each year would be in the form of tax attributes that would warrant a full 
valuation allowance. Further, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that would benefit the effective tax rate as 
of 2020 would be reduced by approximately $161 million  of tax expense related to remeasurement from 35% to 
21%. 
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits anticipated to result in a net decrease to unrecognized tax 
benefits within 12 months of December 31, 2020  is estimated to be between $0 million  and $10 million , primarily 
relating to statute of limitation lapses and tax exam settlements.
The following  is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the 
periods indicated (in millions):
2020 2019 2018
Balance at January 1 $ 465 $ 463 $ 348 
Additions for current year tax positions  —  6  2 
Additions for tax positions of prior years  3  4  146 
Reductions for tax positions of prior years  (6)  (5)  (26) 
Lapse of statute of limitations  (4)  (3)  (7) 
Balance at December 31 $ 458 $ 465 $ 463 176 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the 
taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. While it is 
often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we 
believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. However, audit outcomes and the timing of 
audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the 
range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. It is 
possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current 
unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2020 . 
Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted.
24. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Eletropaulo — Due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016, management decided to pursue a strategic 
shift to reduce the Company's exposure to the Brazilian distribution market.  In December 2017, all criteria were met 
for Eletropaulo to qualify as a discontinued operation. Therefore, its results of operations and financial position were 
reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
In June 2018, the Company completed the sale of its entire 17% ownership interest in Eletropaulo through a 
bidding process hosted by the Brazilian securities regulator, CVM. Gross proceeds of $340 million  were received at 
our subsidiary in Brazil, subject to the payment of taxes. Upon disposal of Eletropaulo, the Company recorded a 
pre-tax gain on sale of $243 million  (after-tax $199 million ). Prior to its classification as discontinued operations, 
Eletropaulo was reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.
Borsod —  In 2011, Borsod, which held two coal and biomass-fired generation plants in Hungary, filed for 
liquidation and was deconsolidated with its historical operating results reflected in discontinued operations under 
prior accounting guidance.
In October 2018, the liquidation was completed and the Company recognized a deferred gain of $26 million , 
primarily comprised of a $20 million  write-off of cumulative translation balances. Prior to its classification as 
discontinued operations, Borsod was reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.
Excluding the gain on sale of Eletropaulo and the deferred gain on liquidation of Borsod, income from 
discontinued operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities of discontinued operations were 
immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
25. HELD-FOR-SALE AND DISPOSITIONS
Held-for-Sale
Mong Duong  — In December 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its entire 51% ownership  
interest in Mong Duong, a coal-fired plant in Vietnam, and 51% equity interest in Mong Duong Finance Holdings 
B.V, an SPV accounted for as an equity affiliate. The sale is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close 
in early 2022 . As of December 31, 2020 , the Mong Duong plant and SPV were classified as held-for-sale, but did 
not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. On a consolidated basis, the carrying value of the 
plant and SPV held-for-sale as of December 31, 2020  was $472 million . Mong Duong is reported in the Eurasia 
SBU reportable segment. 
Estrella del Mar I — The Estrella del Mar I power barge met the held-for-sale criteria as of December 31, 2020, 
but did not meet criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. On a consolidated basis, the carrying value of 
the power barge held-for-sale as of December 31, 2020 was $16 million . Estrella del Mar I is reported in the MCAC 
SBU reportable segment.
Itabo — In June 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 43% ownership interest in Itabo, a 
coal-fired plant and gas turbine in Dominican Republic, for $101 million . In the fourth quarter of 2020, the expected 
sales price was reduced to $92 million , reflecting dividends distributed by Itabo. In February 2021, the sale was 
approved by the Superintendence of Electricity and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. As of December 
31, 2020 , Itabo was classified as held-for-sale, but did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued 
operations. On a consolidated basis, the carrying value of the Itabo facility held-for -sale  as of December 31, 2020  
was $189 million . Itabo is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.177 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
Jordan — In February 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 36% ownership interest in two 
generation plants, IPP1 and IPP4, and a solar plant in Jordan. In December 2019, the original sales agreement 
expired, and in April 2020, one of the potential buyers withdrew from the transaction due to the uncertain economic 
conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, 2020, the solar plant no longer met the held-for-
sale criteria, while the Company continued with an active process to complete the sale of its controlling interest in 
IPP1 and IPP4 and believed the sale remained probable. As such, the solar plant was reclassified as held and used 
as of June 30, 2020. 
In November 2020, the Company signed an agre emen t to s ell 26% ownership interest in IPP1 and IPP4 for 
$58 million . The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. After completion of the sale, the Company 
will retain a 10% ownership interest in IPP1 and IPP4, which will be accounted for as an equity method investment. 
As of December 31, 2020 , the generation plants were classified as held-for-sale, but did not meet the criteria to be 
reported as discontinued operations. On a consolidated basis, the carrying value of the plants held-for-sale as of 
December 31, 2020  was $154 million . Jordan is reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.
Exclud ing any impairment charges, pre-tax income attributable to AES of businesses held-for-sale as of 
December 31, 2020  was as follows (in millions):

Dispositions
Uruguaiana — In September 2020, the Company completed the sale of its entire interest in AES Uruguaiana, 
resulting in a pre-tax loss on sale of $90 million , primarily due to the write-off of cumulative translation adjustments. 
As part of the sale agreement, the Company has guaranteed payment of certain contingent liabilities and provided 
indemnifications to the buyer which were estimated to have a fair value of $22 million . The sale did not meet the 
criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Prior to its sale, Uruguaiana was reported in the South America 
SBU reportable segment.
Kazakhstan Hydroelectric — Affiliates of the Company (the “Affiliates”) previously operated Shulbinsk HPP and 
Ust-Kamenogorsk HPP (the “HPPs”), two hydroelectric plants in Kazakhstan, under a concession agreement with 
the Republic of Kazakhstan (“ROK”). In April 2017, the ROK initiated the process to transfer these plants back to the 
ROK. The ROK indicated that arbitration would be necessary to determine the correct Return Share Transfer 
Payment ("RST") and, rather than paying the Affiliates, deposited the RST into an escrow account. In exchange, the 
Affiliates transferred 100%  of the shares in the HPPs to the ROK, under protest and with a full reservation of rights. 
In February 2018, the Affiliates initiated the arbitration process in international court to recover at least $75 million  of 
the RST placed in escrow, based on the September 30, 2017 RST calculation. 
In May 2020, the arbitrator issued a final decision in favor of the Affiliates, awarding the Affiliates a net amount 
of damages of approximately $45 million , which has been collected. AES recorded the remaining $30 million  as a 
loss on sale during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Prior to their transfer, the Kazakhstan HPPs were reported in 
the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.
Redondo Beach Land — In March 2020, the Company completed the sale of land held by AES Redondo 
Beach, a gas-fired generating facility in California. The land’s carrying value was $24 million , resulting in a pre-tax 
gain on sale of $41 million , reported in Other income  on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
AES Redondo Beach will lease back the land from the purchaser for the remainder of the generation facility’s useful 
life. Redondo Beach is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.
Stuart and Killen — In December 2019, DPL completed the transfer of the co-owned Stuart coal-fired and 
diesel-fired generating units and the Killen coal-fired generating unit and combustion turbine retired in May 2018, 
including the associated environmental liabilities. The transfer resulted in cash expenditures of $51 million  and a 
gain on disposal of $20 million . Prior to their transfer, Stuart and Killen were reported in the US and Utilities SBU 
reportable segment. See Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense  for further information.178 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
Kilroot and Ballylumford — In June 2019, the Company completed the sale of its entire interest in the Kilroot 
coal and oil-fired plant and energy storage facility and the Ballylumford gas-fired plant in the United Kingdom for 
$118 million , resulting in a pre-tax loss on sale of $33 million  primarily due to the write-off of cumulative translation 
adjustments and accumulated other comprehensive income balances. The sale did not meet the criteria to be 
reported as discontinued operations. Prior to the sale, Kilroot and Ballylumford were reported in the Eurasia SBU 
reportable segment. See Note 22—Asset Impairment Expense  for further information.
Shady Point — In May 2019, the Company completed the sale of Shady Point, a U.S. coal-fired generating 
facility, for $29 million . The sale did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Prior to its sale, 
Shady Point was reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment. See Note 22—Asset Impairment 
Expense  for further information.
CTNG — In December 2018, AES Gener completed the sale of CTNG, an entity that holds transmission lines 
in Chile, for $225 million , resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $126 million  after post-closing adjustments. The sale 
did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Prior to its sale, CTNG was reported in the 
South America SBU reportable segment.
Electrica Santiago — In May 2018, AES Gener completed the sale of Electrica Santiago for total consideration 
of $287 million , resulting in a final pre-tax gain on sale of $70 million  after post-closing adjustments. Electrica 
Santiago consisted of four gas and diesel-fired generation plants in Chile. The sale did not meet the criteria to be 
reported as discontinued operations. Prior to its sale, Electrica Santiago was reported in the South America SBU 
reportable segment. 
Masinloc — In March 2018, the Company completed the sale of its entire 51% equity interest in Masinloc for 
cash proceeds of $1.05 billion , resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $772 million  after post-closing adjustments, 
subject to U.S. income tax. Masinloc consisted of a coal-fired generation plant in operation, a coal-fired generation 
plant under construction and an energy storage facility all located in the Philippines. The sale did not meet the 
criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Prior to its sale, Masinloc was reported in the Eurasia SBU 
reportable segment. 
DPL peaker assets — In March 2018, DPL completed the sale of six of its combustion turbine and diesel-fired 
generation facilities and related assets ("DPL peaker assets") for total proceeds of $239 million , resulting in a loss 
on sale of $2 million . The sale did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Prior to their sale, 
the DPL peaker assets were reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.
Beckjord facility — In February 2018, DPL transferred its interest in Beckjord, a coal-fired generation facility 
retired in 2014, including its obligations to remediate the facility and its site. The transfer resulted in cash 
expenditures of $15 million , inclusive of disposal charges, and a loss on disposal of $12 million . Prior to the transfer, 
Beckjord was reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.
Advancion Energy Storage — In January 2018, the Company deconsolidated the AES Advancion energy 
storage development business and contributed it to the Fluence joint venture, resulting in a gain on sale of $23 
million . See Note 8—Investments in and Advances to Affiliates  for further discussion. Prior to the transfer, the AES 
Advancion energy storage development business was reported as part of Corporate and Other.
Excluding any impairment charge or gain/loss on sale, pre-tax income (loss) attributable to AES of disposed 
businesses was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The foll owing table summarizes, e xcluding any 
impairment charge or gain/loss on sale, the pre-tax income (loss) attributable to AES of disposed businesses for the 
periods indicated (in millions):

(1)After the retirement of Stuart and Killen in 2018, t he Company entered into contracts to buy back all open capacity years for the plants at prices lower than the 
PJM capacity revenue prices. As such, the Company continued to earn capacity margin until the plants were transferred in December 2019.  Reductions in the 
asset retirement obligations for ash ponds and landfills at Stuart and Killen in 2018 resulted in a $32 million  reduction to cost of sales. See Note 4—Asset 
Retirement Obligations  for further information.179 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
26. ACQUISITIONS
Ventus Wind Complex  — In December 2020, AES Brasil completed the acquisition of the Ventus Wind 
Complex ("Ventus") for $91 million , including $4 million  of expected working capital adjustments. At closing, the 
Company made an initial cash payment of $44 million . The remainder was recorded as a note payable, which will 
be substantially satisfied via a second installment payment expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021 . The 
transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition; therefore, the total amount of consideration, plus transaction 
costs, was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Any 
differences arising from post-closing adjustments will be allocated accordingly. Ventus is reported in the South 
America SBU reportable segment.
Penonome I  — In May 2020, AES Panama completed the acquisition of the Penonome I wind farm from 
Goldwind International for $80 million . The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, therefore the 
consideration transferred, plus transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities assumed 
based on their relative fair values. Any differences arising from post-closing adjustments  will be allocated 
accordingly. Penonome I is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.
Los Cururos —  In November 2019, AES Gener completed the acquisition of the Los Cururos wind farm and 
transmission lines in Chile from EPM Chile S.A. for total consideration of $143 million , including $5 million  in 
working capital adjustments paid in the first quarter of 2020. The transaction was accounted for as an asset 
acquisition, therefore the consideration transferred, plus transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Los Cururos is reported in the South America 
SBU reportable segment.
Distributed Energy  — In December 2018, Distributed Energy acquired the outstanding noncontrolling interest 
in a partnership holding various solar projects from its tax equity partner for $23 million  of consideration in a non-
cash transaction through the assumption of debt, increasing the Company's ownership to 100% . The partnership 
was previously classified as an equity method investment. The transaction was accounted for as an asset 
acquisition, therefore the Company remeasured the equity investment at fair value and recognized a loss of $5 
million  in Other expense  in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of the investment, along with 
the consideration transferred, plus transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based on their relative fair values. Distributed Energy is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable 
segment.
Oahu — In November 2018, AES Oahu amended a 2017 agreement to acquire 100%  of Na Pua Makani 
Power Partners, a partnership designed to develop and hold a wind project in Hawaii. The fair value of the initial 
consideration was $53 million , of which $48 million  was contingent on meeting predefined development milestones. 
The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a variable interest entity that did not meet the definition of a 
business, therefore the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the 
fair value of the consideration. As a result of the amendment, the Company paid $11 million  in 2018 and the 
contingent consideration was reduced to $5 million , resulting in a $32 million  gain on remeasurement of contingent 
consideration recorded in Other income  in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. AES Oahu is reported in the 
US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.
Guaimbê Solar Complex —  In September 2018, AES Brasil  completed the acquisition of the Guaimbê Solar 
Complex (“Guaimbê”) from Cobra do Brasil for $152 million , comprised of the exchange of $119 million  of non-
convertible debentures in project financing and additional cash consideration of $33 million . The transaction was 
accounted for as an asset acquisition, therefore the consideration transferred, plus transaction costs, was allocated 
to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Guaimbê is reported in 
the South America SBU reportable segment.
27. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock 
and potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining 
diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive RSUs and stock options. The effect of such potential 
common stock is computed using the treasury stock method.
The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per 
share computation for income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 , 2019  and 2018 , 180 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
where income represents the numerator and weighted-average shares represent the denominator.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018
(in millions, except per share data) Income Shares $ per Share Income Shares $ per Share Income Shares $ per Share
BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE
Income (loss) from continuing operations 
attributable to The AES Corporation common 
stockholders $ 43  665 $ 0.06 $ 302  664 $ 0.46 $ 985  662 $ 1.49 
EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES
Stock options  —  1  —  —  —  —  —  —  — 
Restricted stock units  —  2  —  —  3  (0.01)  —  3  (0.01) 
DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE $ 43  668 $ 0.06 $ 302  667 $ 0.45 $ 985  665 $ 1.48 
The calculation of diluted earnings  per share excluded  2 million  outstanding stock awards for the year ended 
December 31,  2018 , which would be anti-dilutive.  These stock awards could potentially dilute basic earnings per 
share in the future.
28. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
AES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See 
additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18—Segments and Geographic Information . 
Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of 
business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, 
and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, 
generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects 
primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.
Operating and Economic Risks — The Company operates in several developing economies where 
macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions 
and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to 
the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities 
and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. 
Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to 
finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating 
from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- , and a below-inve stment grade rating from Moody's of Ba1. A 
downgrade in our current investment grade ratings  could affect the Company's ability to finance new and/or existing 
development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2020 , the Company had $1 billion  of 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.
During 2020 , 66% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international 
operations is conducted in developing countries. We continue to invest in several developing countries to expand 
our existing platform and operations. International operations, particularly the operation, financing, and development 
of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:
•economic, social, and political instability in any particular country or region;
•inability to economically hedge energy prices;
•volatility in commodity prices;
•adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
•government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
•unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;
•high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•restrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas, or other raw materials required by our 
generation businesses to operate;
•threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;
•unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations, or other counterparties to honor 
their commitments;
•unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts, or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are 
economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to 181 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private 
parties;
•inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative, and legal systems;
•adverse changes in government tax policy;
•potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;
•difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local 
jurisdictions; and
•inability to obtain financing on expected terms.
Any of these factors, individually or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our 
business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, our Latin American operations experience 
volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of 
operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability, 
indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, and currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. 
This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these 
businesses.
Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including 
any inability to obtain reasonable increases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely 
impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. 
Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions 
in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory 
review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:
•changes in the determination, definition, or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-
through costs;
•changes in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs;
•adverse changes in tax law;
•changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
•changes in the timing of tariff increases;
•other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or
•changes in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our 
businesses.
Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect 
our results of operations.
COVID-19 Pandemic — The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity, including 
electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets. For the year ended 
December 31, 2020 , the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on demand for electricity and, as a result, on the 
financial results and operations of the Company. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is 
unknown at this time and may have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition 
and cash flows in future periods.
Goodwill  — The Company considers a reporting unit at risk of impairment when its fair value does not exceed 
its carrying amount by more than 10%. In 2019, during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as o f Octob er 
1, the Company determined that the fair value of its Gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 3%. 
Therefore, Gener's $868 million  goodwill balance was considered to be "at risk", largely due to the Chilean 
Government's announcement to phase out coal generation by 2040, and a decline in long-term energy prices.
As a result of the long-lived asset impairments at Gener during the third quarter of 2020, the Company 
determined there was a triggering event requiring a reassessment of goodwill impairment at September 1, 2020 . 
The Company determined the fair value of its Gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 13%. Although the 
fair value exceeds its carrying value by more than 10%, the Company continues to monitor the Gener reporting unit 
for potential interim goodwill impairment triggering events.182 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2020, 2019 and  2018
The Company monitors its reporting units at risk of impairment for interim impairment indicators, and believes 
that the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable as of December 31, 2020 . Should the 
fair value of any of the Company’s reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating 
performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, regulatory changes, or other adverse conditions, 
goodwill impairment charges may be necessary in future periods.
Foreign Currency Risks — AES operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be 
impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate 
between the USD and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the 
Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the Dominican Republic peso, the Euro, 
the Indian rupee, and the Mexican peso.
Argentina  — In September 2019, currency controls were established by the Argentine government in order to 
control the devaluation of the Argentine peso and keep Argentine central bank reserves at acceptable levels. 
Restrictions on the flow of capital have limited the availability of international credit, and economic conditions in 
Argentina have further deteriorated, triggering additional devaluation of the Argentine peso and a deterioration of the 
country’s risk profile.
Concentrations — Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any 
significant concentration of customers or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses 
rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant 
businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total 
revenue in 2020 , 2019  or 2018 .
The cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and 
the continued ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply 
agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAs and/or fuel supply were modified or 
terminated, the Company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such 
contracts at equally favorable terms.
29. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Certain of our businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic are partially owned by governments either 
directly or through state-owned institutions. In the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy 
purchase and sale transactions, and transmission agreements with other state-owned institutions which are 
controlled by such governments. At two of our generation businesses in Mexico, the offtakers exercise significant 
influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' Boards of Directors. These offtakers are also 
required to hold a nominal ownership interest in such businesses. In Chile, we provide capacity and energy under 
contractual arrangements to our investment which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
Additionally, the Company provides certain support and management services to several of its affiliates under 
various agreements.

31. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Guacolda — In February 2021 , AES Gener entered into an agreement to sell its 50% ownership interest in 
Guacolda, a coal-fired plant in Chile, for $34 million . The sale is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to 
close in the first half of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the investment was zero. Pre-tax loss 
attributable to AES was $54 million  and $88 million  for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Pre-tax income attributable to AES was $11 million  for the year ended December 31, 2018. Guacolda is reported in 
the South America SBU reportable segment.
AES Clean Energy  — On January 4, 2021, the sPower and AES Distributed Energy development platforms 
were merged to form AES Clean Energy Development,  which will serve as the development vehicle for all future 
renewable projects in the U.S. Pro forma information has not been presented as the impact of this transaction, 
individually and in the aggregate, was not material to our consolidated financial results.
Gener  — On December 29, 2020, AES Gener commenced a preemptive rights offering for its existing 
shareholders to subscribe for up to 1,980,000,000  of newly issued shares to fund its renewable growth program.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information 
required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO 
and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
The Company carried out the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision 
and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure 
controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon this 
evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2020 , our disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over 
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes 
those policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
•provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements are prevented or detected timely.
Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all 
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must 
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their 
costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may 
become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures deteriorates.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2020 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in 2013. 
Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 .
The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 , has 
been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, 
which appears herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:
There were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020  that have materially 
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.186 | 2020 Annual Report
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited The AES Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 , based on 
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The AES 
Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as 
of December 31, 2020 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020  and 2019 , the related 
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 , and the related notes and financial statement schedule 
listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”), and our report dated 
February 24, 2021 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for 
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting 
was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We 
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
