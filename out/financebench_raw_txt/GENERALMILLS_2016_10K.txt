ldwide.We manage and review the 
financial results of our business under three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice.See Management’s Discussion and Analys
is of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments.For financial informa
tion by segment and geographic area, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial State ments in Item 8 of this report.We offer a variety o
f food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience and value for consumers around th e world, with a focus on five large globalcategories:
 
 
•  ready-to-eat cereal; 
 
•  convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees; 
 
•  snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks; 
 
•  yogurt; and 
 
•  super-premium ice cream.Other significant product 
categories include: 
 
•  baking mixes and ingredients; and 
 
•  refrigerated and frozen dough.Our Cereal Partners Worldwide 
(CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in th e ready-to-eat cereal category in markets outside North America, andour Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint v
enture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, see Note 16 to the Consolidat
ed Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Customers.

consolidated net sales. For fu rther information on significant customers, please refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statementsin Item 8 of this report.
Competition. 
The consumer foods industry is highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and throughout the world. The food categories in which we par
ticipate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and otherresources. Competition in our p
roduct categories is based on product innovation, product qu ality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing,promotional activity, 
and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effec
tive customer relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned withconsumers’ needs, an effi
cient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we comp ete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but alsowith regional brands and with gene
ric and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local manufacture
rs, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.Raw materials, ingredients, and 
packaging. The principal raw mate rials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits,meats, vegetable oils, 
and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, pla stic and metal packaging materials,operating supplies, and energy. Mos
t of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. In ourinternational opera
tions, inputs that are not locally avai lable in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuatewidely due to external condi
tions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changesin governmental agricu
ltural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on theopen market. We believ
e that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of ne eded inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of itemssignificant to our business in o
rder to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels 
that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extentpossible, we often manage the 
risk associated with adverse price movemen ts for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grainmerchandising operation 
that provides us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds ph
ysical inventories that are carried at fair market value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its marketexposures.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our research and developmen
t resources are focused on new produ ct development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging, andexploratory research 
in new business and technology areas. Research and development expenditures were $222 million in fiscal 2016, $229 million in fiscal 2015, and $244 million in fiscal 2014.

In general, demand for our p
roducts is evenly balanced throughout th e year. However, within our U.S. Retail segment demand for refrigerated dough, frozen bakedgoods, and baking products is stronger in 
the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso
 soup is higher during the fall and winter months. Int ernationally,demand for 
Häagen-Dazs
 ice cream is higher du ring the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due tothe offsetting impac
t of these demand trends, as well as the diff erent seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our International segment net sales aregenerally evenly balan
ced throughout the year.BACKLOG
Orders are generally f
illed within a few days of receipt and are subj ect to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders as ofMay 29, 2016, was not material.
WORKING CAPITAL
A description of our working capit
al is included in the Liquidity se ction of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Our product return practices are described in Note 2 tothe Consolidated Financial Sta

Table of ContentsENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
As of May 29, 2016, we were involved with two active 
cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonach
ie, New Jersey. These matters involve several different actions, including administrative proceedings commenced byregulatory agencies and

ITEM 1A
Risk Factors Our business is subject to various r
isks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, andresults of operations.
 
7

Table of ContentsThe food categories in which we participate are ve
ry competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results o f operations could beadversely affected.
The food categories in which we pa
rticipate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categorie s all have substantial financial, marketing, and otherresources. In most product c
ategories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic andprivate 
label products that ar e generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brandrecognition and loyalty, e
ffectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consum er preferences. If our large competitors wereto seek an advantage through pr
icing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we didnot do the 
same, our revenues and mark et share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are notsuccessful in introducing innov
ative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our co mpetitors. If we are unable tobuild and sustain brand equity by of
fering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private labelproducts.
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the fac
e of a consolidating retail environment.There has been significan
t consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to 
improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increasedemphasis on generic and othe
r economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation,knowledge of consumers’ needs, and c
ategory leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any la
rge customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2016, Wal-Mart accounted for 20percent of our consolidat
ed net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our U.S. Retail segment. For more infor mation on significant customers, please see Note 7 to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 of this report.Price changes for the commoditi
es we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.The principal raw materials t
hat we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity ma
rket fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations.Commodity price changes may 
result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unabl e to increase productivity to offset theseincreased costs or incr
ease our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and therisk management 
procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.Volatility in the market value of der
ivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volat ility in our gross margins andnet earnings.
We utilize deriva
tives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principallysoybean), dairy products, natur
al gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. Th
ese gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate itemsoutside our segment operat
ing results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufa cturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified tosegment operating profi
t. We also record our grain inventories at fair value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.

Table of ContentsIf we are not efficient in our production, our profi
tability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings g
rowth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our produ cts in highly competitivemarkets. Gaining additiona
l efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundantcosts resulting from acqu
isitions or divestitures could adve rsely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involvecomplex reorganizat
ion of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of produc tion, which maynegatively impact produ
ct volume and margins. We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase ourefficiency and reduc
e expenses. If we are unable to execute those initi atives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which couldadversely affect our bus
iness and results of operations.Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.
Our ability to make, move, and s
ell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distributioncapabilities due to weather
, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import restrictions, orother factors could imp
air our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Our suppliers’ policies and pr actices can damage our reputation and the quality and safetyof our products. Failure to tak
e adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a produc
t is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additionalresources to restore our supp
ly chain.Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certa
in food products or ingredients.We could be adversely af
fected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types o
f concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.If our food products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabel
ed, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims ifconsumers are injured.
We may need to recal
l some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in signific ant lossesdue to the costs of a reca
ll, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer lossesfrom a significant produ
ct liability judgment against us. A signific ant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to ourreputation, and a loss of consum
er confidence in our food products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our b rands.We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer prefer
ences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our abi
lity to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their pref erences. Consumerpreferences and category-level c
onsumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail toanticipate, identify or react to
 these changes and trends, or to introduce new and i mproved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for ourproducts, which would in turn cause our r
evenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regard ingthe health effects o
f ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster g
rowing and more profitable categories.The food industry’s growth potentia
l is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets 
that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and moreprofitable categor
ies. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market sh are in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed indeveloping innovative products 
for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which could adversely affect our profitability.

Table of ContentsEconomic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.
The willingness of consumers to pur
chase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchasemore generic, privat
e label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction insales of higher margin produ
cts or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of e conomic conditions or competitive actions, wemay be unable to raise our p
rices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customersthat purchase 
products from our Convenience Stor es and Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our 
results may be negatively impacted i f consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.Maintaining and continual
ly enhancing the value of our many iconic br ands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large parton the degree to which consumers 
react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, inc ludingconsumer perception tha
t we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, thefailure of our products to d
eliver consistently positive consumer experiences, con cerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.Consumer demand for our products m
ay also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third p
arties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts orcomments about us, our brands, or our p
roducts on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorableperception of our brands, our busin
ess results could be negatively impacted.Our international operations are subject to pol
itical and economic risks.In fiscal 2016, 28 percent of ou
r consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business international
ly, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: 
•
 political and economic instability;•
 exchange controls and currency exchange rates;•
 nationalization of operations;•
 compliance with anti-corruption regulations;•
 foreign tax treaties and policies; and•
 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.Our financial perform
ance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause materialvariations in our results o
f operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chineserenminbi, euro, Japanese yen, M
exican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure tocurrency fluctuations, b
ut these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could advers
ely affect our business.Our facilities and produc
ts are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and DrugAdministration, the Occupat
ional Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production,packaging, labelling, stor
age, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of ou r employees. Our failure to 
10

Table of Contentscomply with such laws and regulat
ions could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of ourproducts. We advertise our 
products and could be the targ et of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws andregulations. We may also b
e subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including proposals to limi t advertising to children.Changes in laws or regulations tha
t impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing ourresults of operations to be 
adversely affected. We are subject to var
ious federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regu lationscould subject us to lawsuits, adm
inistrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due toregulatory complexities, u
ncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk o f unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential existsfor remediation, liability, in
demnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these m atters, orcompliance with environm
ental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adverse
ly affect our ability to paydividends.
As of May 29, 2016, we had total debt, redee
mable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $9.6 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurr
ing additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: 
•
 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debtsecurities by rating org
anizations were revised downward; and •
 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.There are various finan
cial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of theserequirements, the re
lated indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtainadditional or altern
ative financing may also be adversely affected.Our ability to make schedul
ed payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing e
conomic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.Global capital and credit market issues 
could negatively affect our liquidity, inc rease our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliersand customers.
We depend on 
stable, liquid, and well-fun ctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financialassets, access to capital a
nd credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be noassurance that future vo
latility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interestrate 
derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs ofborrowing. Our business could also be negat
ively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions re sulting from tighter capital and credit markets ora slowdown in the general economy.
Volatility in the securities 
markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit,and postemployment benefit costs.
We sponsor a number of defined b
enefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, seve
rance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globallydiversified portfolio of
 
11

Table of Contentssecurities and other inve
stments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of planassets can affect the 
funded status of our defined ben efit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. Asignificant increas
e in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology syste
ms fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology se
rves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology ne tworks and systems,including the internet, 
to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and taxrequirements. Our inform
ation technology systems a nd infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing,order entry and fulfil
lment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable int ernal and externalcommunication among our lo
cations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees,consumers, and proprietary bus
iness information. Our informa tion technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may bevulnerable to damage, in
terruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems f ailures,telecommunications failures, sec
urity breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose apotential risk to the se
curity and viability of our information techno logy systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on thosesystems. The failure of our 
information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processinginefficiencies, da
ta loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technologysystems could have operation
al, reputational, legal, and financial impacts t hat may have a material adverse effect on our business.A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of 
our businesses or a different weighted-average cos t of capital used to value ourreporting units or our indefinite-lived intangibl
e assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of May 29, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the net assets of areporting unit, including goodwil
l, to the fair value of the unit. If the fair value of the net assets of the r eporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill,impairment has occur
red. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determinedusing inputs from our long-range p
lanning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and otherfactors. While we curr
ently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future pe rformance of our businesses could result insignificant impairment losses.
We evaluate the usefu
l lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangibl e assets associated with the Pillsbury
 , Totino’s
, Progresso
, Yoplait
, Old
El
Paso
, Yoki
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Annie’s
brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Rea ching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments andassumptions regarding the fu
ture effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative 
action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of requiredmaintenance expenditu
res, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived in
tangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our 
estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from ourlong-range plan, assumed roya
lty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our Uncle
Toby’s
 and Mountain
High
brands have experienced declining bus
iness performance. Our strategies for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 will focus our growth investments on our brands and platforms with the strongest profitable growth po
tential. As a result, certain parts of our U.S. Retail segment could experience reduced future sales projections. We 
12

Table of Contentsperformed a sensitivi
ty analysis for certain brand intangible assets and determined that, while not impaired as of May 29, 2016, the Progresso
 and Food
ShouldTaste
Good
brands had risk of decreasing cove rage. We will continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, pleaserefer to Note 6 to the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Our failure to successfully integ
rate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.From time to time, we eva
luate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired 
and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risksassociated with acquisit
ions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers o f the acquired business, the assumption of unknownliabilities, the inh
erent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieveanticipated synergies, an
d the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a global consume
r foods company. We develop distinc tive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuouslyto improve our core products 
and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-d
irected marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winningand sustaining leading share pos
itions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financi
al goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment opera tingprofit, earnings per shar
e (EPS), free cash flow conversion, cash return to shareholders, and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performancefor our business.
Our long-term growth objectiv
es are to consistently deliver: 
•
 low single-digit annual growth in net sales; 
•
 mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; 
•
 high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability; 
•
 improvement in adjusted return on average total capital; 
•
 free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and 
•
 cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.We believe that this financial 
performance should result in long-term value creation for shareholders.Fiscal 2016 was an important step 
toward returning to our long-term growth objectives. Our U.S. Retail segment improved its operating profit performance in fiscal 2016, excluding the impact of 
acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the North American Green Giant business (Green Giant) divestiture and 6 incrementalmonths of results from the 
acquisition of Annie’s, Inc. (Annie’s). Net sales as reported decl ined 5 percentage points in fiscal 2016, which included 2 percentagepoints of decline from th
e net impact of Green Giant and Annie’s and 1 percentage point of decline from a 53 rd week in fiscal 2015. While net sales growth did notmeet our expectations, op
erating profit increased 1 percent, despite the 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 and the net unfavorable impact of the Green Giant divestiture andAnnie’s acquisition. Operating p
rofit for the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment increased 7 percent, driven primarily by our 6 priority productplatforms. Operating resu
lts for the International segment had good growth in developed markets that was tempered by slowdowns in developing markets.International net sa

a, but grew 3 percent on a constant-currency basis. International segment operating profit declined 15 percent and was impacted by12 percentage 
points of unfavorable fore ign currency exchange and slowing economic growth in China and Brazil, as well as the effect of divestitures.Our consolidated 
net sales for fiscal 2016 d eclined 6 percent to $16.6 billion, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, a 53 rd week in fiscal 2015, and thenet impact of acquisi
tions and divestitures. On a constant-currency bas is, net sales decreased 2 percent. Operating profit of $2.7 billion increased 30 percent. Totalsegment operating profi

earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned significant cash to shareholdersthrough a 7 percent 
dividend increase and shar e repurchases totaling $607 million. Total cash returned to shareholders represented 79 percent of our free cash flow(see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section be
low for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). We recorded the following 
achievements related to our other key operating objectives for fiscal 2016: 
•
 We took steps to reshape our business portfolio to drive future growth with the divestiture of our North American Green Giant vegetable business and twosmaller divestures, th
e Venezuela canned meat business and the foodservice dough business in Argentin a. We also acquired EPIC Provisions LLC (Epic),broadening our product offer
ings in our U.S. natural and organic portfolio to include meat snacks, and we entered the growing Brazilian yogurt marketthrough the 
acquisition of Laticin ios Carolina Ltda. (Carolina). 
•
 We generated strong levels of supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2016 through our ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. We alsocontinued to execute our cos
t savings and organizational initiatives during the fiscal year. We expanded Project Century, an initiative to streamline our NorthAmerican distribution and 
manufacturing network, to our International segment supply chain. We also initiated Project Compass, with a focus on increasing the agility and effe
ctiveness of our International segment. Finally, we continued to realize benefits from Project Catalyst, a fiscal 2015 restructuring plan toincrease organizat
ional effectiveness and reduce overhead expense. In aggregate, the initi atives taken in fiscal 2015 and 2016 generated almost $350 millionin cost savings during fiscal 2016.
A detailed 
review of our fiscal 2016 per formance appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2016 Consolidated Results of Operations.”With strong savings 
in Fiscal 2016 and visibility to further savings over the next two years, we now expect our previously announced organizational restructuringand cost-reduction init
iatives, including Projects Century, Catalyst, and Compass, as well as administrative cost reductions, to generate total annual savings of $600million by fiscal 2018. We 
are also undertaking further efforts to prioritize investments, reduce complexity, and streamline our operations to drive profitable salesgrowth. As 
a result, we are incre asing and accelerating our adjusted operating profit margin expansion target. We expect to achieve an adjusted operating profitmargin of 20 percent by fis
cal 2018, an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels. Key drivers of margin expansion ov er the next two years will include: 
 
•  Strong levels of HMM productivity gains; 
 
•  Continuing savings from previously announced cost-reduction initiatives; 
 
•  Increased efficiency and prioritization of commercial investments, including trade and consumer spending; 
 
•  Continuing focus on complexity reduction through SKU optimization; 
 
•  Further supply chain optimization; and 
 
•  Continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business.We will focus our fiscal 2017 
and fiscal 2018 growth investments on our brands and pl atforms with the strongest profitable growth potential, including: 
 
•  In the U.S. Retail segment – Cereal, snack bars, the natural and organic portfolio, hot snacks, Mexican products, and yogurt; 
 
•  Our International segment;

• In the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment – Cereal, yogurt, snacks, frozen meals, biscuits, and baking mixes – the segment’s current Focus6 platforms.
Net sales for these “growth” bus
inesses, which comprise 75 percent of total company net sales and a similar proportion of operating profit, are expected to grow at a low single-digit organic 
rate in fiscal 2017. In our “foundation” businesses, which comprise the remainder of the portfolio, we will only pursue selective growthinvestments and will focus on r
educing SKU complexity, optimizing commercial investments , and prioritizing profitable volume while making selective ConsumerFirst investments. We expe
ct organic net sales to decline mid single-digits for these businesses in fiscal 2017. With this focused approach, we expect:  
 
• Fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth ranging from flat to down 2 percent compared to fiscal 2016, but deliver a 6 to 8 percent increase in constant-currency total segmen
t operating profit. 
 
•  Fiscal 2017 adjusted operating profit margin to increase by approximately 150 basis points; and 
 
•  Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS to grow 6 to 8 percent from the base of $2.92 earned in fiscal 2016.Our fiscal 2017 plans call fo
r continued strong cash returns to shareholders. The current annualized dividend rate of $1.92 per share is up 8 percent from the annual dividend paid in fiscal 2016. Shar
e repurchases in fiscal 2017 are expected to result in a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 1 to 2percent.

in fiscal 2015 related to Venezuela currency devaluation.We also expect to incur 
approximately $109 million of restructu ring initiative project-related cash costs and recorded $58 million of these costs in cost of sales infiscal 2016 compared to $13 m

Our consolidated 
effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 31.4 percent compared to 33.3 percent in fiscal 2015. The 1.9 percentage point dec rease was primarily dueto the unfavorable impa

U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT
In fiscal 2015, we realigned 
certain operating uni ts within our U.S. Retail operating segment. We also changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Yogurtand our Big G operating unit to Cerea
l. Frozen Foods transitioned into Meals and Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned into Snacks, Cere al, and Meals.The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. 
We revised the amounts previously reported in the net sales and net sales percentage change by operating unit within ourU.S. Retail segment to conform to 
the new operating unit structur e. These realignments had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operatingsegments’ net sales, oper
ating profit, segment operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or EPS. In addition, results from th e acquired Annie’sbusiness are included in the M
eals and Snacks operating units.Our U.S. Retail segment reflec
ts business with a wide variety of groce ry stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar anddiscount chains, and e-comm
erce grocery providers operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrige
rated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit andsavory snacks, and a wide variety o
f organic products including meal kits, granola bars, and cereal.U.S. Retail net sales were as fol

The impact due to an addit ional month of results from Annie’s was not material to the Meals and Snacks operating units. The impact to fiscal 2016 net salesgrowth for the U.S. Retail segment was not 
material.Segment operating profit o
f $2,179 million in fiscal 2016 increased $20 million, or 1 percent, from fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily driven by high levels of promotional expense in fis
cal 2015, cost savings from Project Catalyst and other cost management initiatives, a decrease in media and advertising expenses, andlower supply chain costs, parti
ally offset by the net impact of the Green Giant divestitur e and Annie’s acquisition.Segment operating profit o
f $2,159 million in fiscal 2015 declined $152 million, or 7 percent, from fiscal 2014. The decr ease was primarily driven by lower volumeand an increase in supply cha
in costs, partially offset by a 6 percent reduction in media and advertising expenses.INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT

Fiscal 2016 percentage chang e in net sales as reported for the Europe region includes 3 percentage points of growth due to an additional month of resultsfrom Yoplait SAS. The impact to fis
cal 2016 net sales growth for the International seg ment was not material.Segment operating profit 
for fiscal 2016 declined 15 percent to $442 million from $523 million in fiscal 2015, primari ly driven by unfavorable foreign currencyexchange, an increase in SG&A expens
es, and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. International segment operating profit decreased 3 percent on a constant-currency basis in 
fiscal 2016 compared to f iscal 2015 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure).Segment operating profit 
for fiscal 2015 declined 2 per cent to $523 million from $535 million in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currencyexchange and higher input costs, p
artially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. International segment operating profit incr eased 9 percent on a constant-currency basis in fisca

Unallocated 
corporate items inc lude corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the GeneralMills Foundation, asset and liab
ility remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related  costs, and other items that arenot part of our measurem
ent of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positionsuntil passed back 
to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.For fiscal 2016, unallocated 
corporate expense totaled $289 million compared to $414 million last year. In fiscal 2016, we recorded a $63 million net decrease in expense related to ma
rk-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $90 million net increase in expense in the prioryear. In addition, we record
ed $78 million of restructuring charges, and $58 million of restructuring initiative pr oject-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016,compared to $60 million of 
restructuring charges and $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. We recorded an $8million foreign exchang
e loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2015. We also recorded $16 million ofintegration costs resul
ting from the acquisition of Annie’s in fiscal 2015. The decrease in unallocated corp orate expense also reflects cost savings from ProjectCatalyst and other cost man
agement initiatives.For fiscal 2015, 
unallocated corporat e expense totaled $414 million compared to $258 million in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $90 million net increasein expense related to mark-t
o-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $49 million n et decrease in fiscal 2014. Inaddition, we recorded $60 mil
lion of restructuring charges and $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. In fiscal2015, we recorded an $8 
million foreign exchang e loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary compared to $62 millionin fiscal 2014. We also re
corded $16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie’s in fiscal 2015. Venezuela is a highly infl
ationary economy and as such, we remeasured the value of the assets and liabilities of our former Venezuelan subsidiary based on the exchange rate at which we exp
ected to remit dividends in U.S. dollars from the SIMADI market. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign currencyexchange loss related to 
remeasurement. In fiscal 2016, we sold our General Mills de Venezu ela CA subsidiary to a third party and exited our business inVenezuela. As a result of this 
transaction, we recorded a loss on the sale of $38 million pre-tax.

Table of ContentsIn fiscal 2015, we changed how we assess segm
ent operating performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact from hyperinflati onaryeconomies. This impact is now in
cluded in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation.IMPACT OF INFLATION
Our gross margin performanc
e in fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of 2 percent input cost inflation, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation of2 percent in fiscal 2017. W
e attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk manag ement practices arediscussed in Item 7A of this repo
rt.LIQUIDITY
The primary source of our l
iquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $7.7 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this op
erating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fundour capital expenditur
es and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-ter m debt to finance significant acquisitions and majorcapital expansions.
As of May 29, 2016, we had $645 million of cash 
and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions, which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions.There is currently no need 
to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriate historical earnings he
ld in foreign jurisdictions, we intend to do so only in a tax-neutral manner.Cash Flows from

rred income taxes and a $148 million net gain on divestitures and was also offset by a $424 million decrease in non-cash restructuringcharges. The $43 million chang
e in current assets and liabiliti es was primarily driven by the timing of accounts payable including the impact of longer terms offsetby the timing of inventory bui
ld.We strive to grow core working c
apital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2016, core working capital decreased 41 percent, primarily due to an increase in accounts p
ayable, largely driven by longer payables terms and a decrease in inventory, compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent. In fiscal 2015,core working capital decrea
sed 13 percent, compared to a net sales decline of 2 percent, and in fiscal 2014, core working capital decreased 9 percent, compared tonet sales growth of 1 percent.

e commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommi tted and asset-backed credit lines thatsupport our foreign
 operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5times.
Certain of our long-term d
ebt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 29, 2016, we were in compliance with all of 
these covenants.We have $1,103 million of long-
term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $1,000 million of 5.7 per cent fixed rate notes dueFebruary 2017. We believe tha
t cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity andcapital needs for at 
least the next 12 months. As of May 29, 2016, our total debt, including 
the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 78 percent in fixed-rate and 22 perc ent in floating-rateinstruments, compared to 72 p
ercent in fixed-rate and 28 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 31, 2015.

Table of ContentsReturn on average total c
apital was 12.9 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to 9.1 percent in fiscal 2015. Improvement in return on  adjusted average total capital isone of our key performance 
measures (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Adjustedreturn on average total 
capital increased 10 b asis points from 11.2 percent in fiscal 2015 to 11.3 percent in fiscal 2016 as fiscal 2016 earnings increased. On aconstant-currency basis, 
adjusted return on average total capital increased 40 basis points.We also believe that ou
r fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fis
cal 2016 was 7.40 compared to 5.54 in fiscal 2015. The measure increased from fiscal 2015 as earnings before income taxes and after-taxearnings from joint ventu
res increased by $642 million in fiscal 2016. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio inc reased 3.5 percentage points to 31.2 percent in fiscal2016, driven by a decrease in to
tal debt.We have a 51 percent 
controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaininginterests in each of th
ese entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statem ents. We record Sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in YoplaitMarques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl as non
controlling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our ConsolidatedBalance Sheets. These euro- and Can
adian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability toput all or a portion of its 
redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times befor e December 2024. As of May 29, 2016, the redemption valueof the redeemable interest wa
s $846 million which approximates its fair value.The third-party holder of 
the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating 
preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252million). On June 1, 2015, the float
ing preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to the su m of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. Thepreferred return r
ate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. We have an option to purchase 
the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole a
mount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directlyto retained earnings and
 will increase or decrease the net earnings used to ca lculate EPS in that period.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGE
MENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSAs of May 29, 2016, we have issued guarantees and 
comfort letters of $383 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters o
f $239 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements aregenerally limited to the future
 payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $398 mi llion as of May 29, 2016.As of May 29, 2016, we had invested in five var
iable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, orliquidity as of and for the 
fiscal year ended May 29, 2016.Our defined 
benefit plans in the United St ates are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us to makeadditional contributions 
to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2017.

Operating leases represent s the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.(c)
The majority of the purch ase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and forconsumer marketing spending 
commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arr angements are considered purchase obligations if acontract specifies all significant
 terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction.Most 
arrangements are c ancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated BalanceSheets as accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.(d)
The fair value of our for eign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $44 million as ofMay 29, 2016, based on fair market v
alues as of that date. Future changes in market va lues will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received tosettle those instrumen
ts in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including theunderfunded status 
of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities.We expect to pay $22 mill
ion of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $14 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2017. We areunable to reliably est
imate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2017. As of May 29, 2016, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accruedinterest and penalti
es was $209 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
 ESTIMATESFor a complete descript
ion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates 
are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include ouraccounting for promotiona
l expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, rede emable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, anddefined benefit pension, oth
er postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.Promotional Expenditures
Our promotional 
activities are condu cted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers toperform merchandising 
activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower r etail shelf prices; payments to gaindistribution of new products; coupons, 
contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation ofcustomer 
participation and per formance levels. These estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotionalactivities, and other factors
. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.Our accrued trade, coupon, and consu
mer marketing liabilities were $564 million as of May 29, 2016, and $565 million as of May 31, 2015. Because our totalpromotional expenditures 
(including amounts classi fied as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to makeadjustments in subsequent per
iods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

Table of ContentsValuation of Long-Lived Assets
We estimate the use
ful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes incircumstances indic
ate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows orindependent appraisals, as 
appropriate.Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other 
indefinite-lived in tangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that impairment
 may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determ ined based on a discounted cashflow model. We use inputs from ou
r long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates,perpetuity growth assumptions, m
arket comparables, and other f actors.We evaluate the usefu
l lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Rea ching a determination on useful liferequires significant 
judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability ofthe industry, known 
technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distributionchannels), the level of re
quired maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible ass ets that are deemed to have definitelives are amortiz
ed on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is basedon a 
discounted cash flow model using inpu ts which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did notown the brands, and a discount rate.
As of May 29, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying va
lue and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding futureperformance of our business
es or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material im pairment losses and amortization expense. We performedour fiscal 2016 assessment of ou
r intangible assets as of August 31, 2015. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair val
ues were substantially in excess of the carrying values, except for the Mountain
High
 and Uncle
Toby’s
brands. The excess fair value above the carrying value o

In fiscal 2016, we adjusted 
the redemption value of Sodi aal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significantassumptions used to estimat
e the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depr eciation andtaxes, foreign currency 
exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 29, 2016, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $846 million.

Table of ContentsStock-based Compensation
The valuation of stock options is 
a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statem
ents. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and theforfeiture rate. For more inf
ormation on these assumptions, please refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financia l Statements in Item 8 of this report.The estimated fair v
alues of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option -pricing model were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal Year    
  2016   2015   2014 Estimated fair valu
es of stock options granted   $7.24      $7.22     $6.03  Assumptions:
      Risk-free interest rate
   2.4%      2.6%     2.6%  Expected term
   8.5 years     8.5 years     9.0 years  Expected volatility
   17.6%     17.5%     17.4%  Dividend yield
   3.2%      3.1%     3.1%    
             The risk-free inter
est rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effec t at the time of grant.An increase in the expect
ed term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent. If all otherassumptions are held constan
t, a one percentage point incr ease in our fiscal 2016 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2016option awards by 7 percent.
To the extent that actu
al outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values.However, these differences 
can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs.Furthermore, historica
l data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant var iances between actual and predicted experience couldlead to prospective rev
isions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.Any corporate income tax ben
efit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented 
in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ financing cash flows will depend,in part, on the volume of emp
loyee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship  between the exercise-date market value of the underlyingstock and the original gran
t-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.Realized windfall tax be
nefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously r
ecognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to incometax expense, potentially 
resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated  a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for thepurpose of accounting for futu
re shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect fu
ture earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it ispossible that significan
tly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. 
36

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
We apply a more-like
ly-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 
percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution ofuncertain tax positions wil
l affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on inco me taxes, please refer to Note 14 to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8 of this report.Defined Benefit 
Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemp loyment Benefit PlansWe have defined benefi
t pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, France, and th e United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans thatprovide health care ben
efits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits toformer and inactive 
employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefitspayable upon death. Please re
fer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report fo r a description of our defined benefit pension, otherpostretirement bene
fit, and postemployment benefit plans.We recognize 
benefits provided during re tirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make variousassumptions to predict and m
easure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that requ ire significant managementjudgment and have a material
 impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-termrates of return on plan 
assets, the interest r ates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.Expected Rate of Return on Plan 
Assets Our expected rate of re
turn on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using 
input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review thisassumption annually for ea
ch plan; however, our annual investment performance for one pa rticular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.Our historical investmen
t returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United Sta tes defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were0.7 percent, 7.8 percent, 6.6 per
cent, 7.4 percent, and 8.6 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 29, 2016.On a weighted-average basis, th
e expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 8.53 percent for fiscal 2016, 8.53 percent for fiscal 2015, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2014. During fisca
l 2016, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and otherpostretirement plans 
in the United States to 8.25 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio.Lowering the expected long-t
erm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretire ment expense by $64 million for fiscal2017. A market-related va
luation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or lossesover a five-year 
period from the year in whi ch they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculatedusing the market-related value
 of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuari es perform these calculations as part ofour determination of annu
al expense or income.Discount Rates
Our discount rate assumptions a
re determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, andpostemployment benefit p
lan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to planparticipants and, using the Aa Above M
edian corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our creditrisk. This forward interest 
rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

rates were as follows:

imately $96 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over theaverage remaining service perio
d of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates
We 
review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided byour actuaries. This infor
mation includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and pro jections, and assumptions used by other similarorganizations. Our initia
l health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations.Our 
initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.5 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 7.3 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2016. Ratesare graded down annually until 
the ultimate trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees. T he trend rates are applicable for calculations only if theretirees’ benefits increase as a re
sult of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term i
nflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amountsreported for the other p
ostretirement benefit plans.A one percentage point change 
in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

laims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gainsand losses are amortiz
ed using a straight-line method over 10 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded.Financial Statement Impact
In fiscal 2016, we recorded 
net defined benefit pens ion, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $163 million compared to $153million of expense in fis
cal 2015 and $140 million of expense in fiscal 2014. As of May 29, 2016, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial  net losses of $1.9billion on our defined benef
it pension plans and $72 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increasesfrom lower interest rates, 
partially offset by r ecent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in ourfuture pension and postreti
rement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Assumed mortality rates 
of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. On October 27, 2014, 
the Society of Actuaries published RP-2014 Mortality Tables and Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014, whichboth reflect
 
38

Table of Contentsimproved longevity. In fisc
al 2015, we adopted the change to the mortality assumptions to remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirementbenefit plans obligations, whi
ch increased the total o f these obligations by $437 million in fiscal 2015. In addition, these assumptions increased the fiscal 2016expense associated with thes
e plans by $72 million.Actual future net defin
ed benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investmentperformance, changes in 
future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRON
OUNCEMENTSIn March 
2016, the Financial Accounting Standa rds Board (FASB) issued new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-basedpayments. This will result in 
realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits upon exercise or vesting of stock-based awards being reco rded in our ConsolidatedStatements of Earnings in add
ition to other presentation changes. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning afterDecember 15, 2016, and 
interim periods within thos e annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are in theprocess of analyzing the i
mpact on our results of operations and financial position.In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requi
rements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in most leases beingcapitalized as a r
ight of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annualreporting periods beginning a
fter December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in theprocess of analyzing the i
mpact on our results of operations and financial position.In May 2015, the FASB issued new accounting require
ments for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing a practical expedient to exclude such investments f
rom categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annualreporting periods beginning a
fter December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual per iods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We do notexpect this guidance to hav
e a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting requir
ements which permits reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end toapply a practical exp
edient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity’s fiscalyear-end and apply such prac
tical expedient consistently to all plans. The requirements of the new st andard are effective for annual reporting periods beginningafter December 15, 2015, and in
terim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impac
t on our results of operations or financial position.In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting require
ments for the recognition of revenue from contra cts with customers. The requirements of the new standardand its subsequent amendments 
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods,which 
for us is the first quart er of fiscal 2019. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to marke
t risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in thes e factors couldcause fluctuations in our 
earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into varioushedging transactions, author
ized under established policie s that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highlyrated institutions. We 
establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of  derivative financialinstruments. For informat
ion on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 of 
this report.VALUE AT RISK
The estimates in the t
able below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates,foreign exchange rates, 
commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market r
isk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.The VAR calculation used historic
al interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these 
rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses infair value that we expe
ct to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the deriv ative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect thatany loss or gain in the fair v
alue of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the calcul
ations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures and options; and equityinstruments. The calcul
ations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities o r equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

We have audited the ac

ts of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable interest, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year periodended May 29, 2016. In connection with our aud

(2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). General Mills, Inc.’s management is responsiblefor these consolidated f
inancial statements and financial statement sched ule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for itsassessment of the effectivene
ss of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibi
lity is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on theCompany’s internal control ov
er financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require tha t weplan and perform the au
dits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was maintained in all material respec ts. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis,evidence supporting the amoun
ts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evalua
ting the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understandingof internal control ove
r financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material we akness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness ofinternal control based on 
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinions.A company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide re asonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand dispositions of the assets of 
the Company; (2) provide reasonabl e assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financialstatements in accord
ance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in ac cordance withauthorizations of manag
ement and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition o
f the Company’s assets t hat could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent o r detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.

Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements
GENERAL MILLS, 
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTE 1. BASIS OF 
PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONSBasis of Presentation
Our 
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.Intercompany transac
tions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those transact ions, are eliminated in consolidation.Our fiscal year ends on the l
ast Sunday in May. Fiscal years 2016 and 2014 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2015 cons isted of 53 weeks.Change in Reporting Period
As part of a long-term plan 
to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2016 we changed the reporting period of Yoplait SAS and YoplaitMarques SNC within our International s
egment and Annie’s, Inc. (Annie’s) within our U.S. Retail segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-endto match our fiscal c
alendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2016, our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes wasnot material to our conso
lidated results of operations. Our General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) and India businesses remain on an April fiscal year end.Certain reclassifications to 
our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation.NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOU
NTING POLICIESCash and Cash Equivalents
We 
consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Inventories
All inventories in the United St
ates other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories and all related cash contra
cts and derivatives are valued at market with all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.Inventories outside of 
the United States are gene rally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.Shipping costs associated with the 
distribution of finished produ ct to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the related finishedproduct is shipped to and accep
ted by the customer.Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation
Land 
is recorded at histori cal cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost and depreciated overestimated useful liv
es, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charg ed to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciatedover 40 years, and equipment, fu
rniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipmentuntil 
disposal. When an item is sold o r retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any,are recognized in ea
rnings. As of May 29, 2016, assets held for sale were insignificant. Long-lived assets are rev
iewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impai
rment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group areless than the carrying a
mount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable c ash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of animpairment loss would be based on 
the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent appra
isals, as appropriate. 
58

Table of ContentsGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not subject to amort
ization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may haveoccurred. In fiscal 2016, we ch
anged the date of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment from the first day of the thirdquarter to the first d
ay of the second quarter to more closely align with the timing of our annual long-range planning p rocess. Impairment testing is performed foreach of our reporting units. 
We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assetsand 
liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If thecarrying amount of a repo
rting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair valueof the net assets is grea
ter than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill, impairment has occur
red. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determinedusing inputs from our long-range p
lanning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetui ty growth assumptions, market comparables, and otherfactors.
We evaluate the usefu
l lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if t hey are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful liferequires significant 
judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological 
advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distributionchannels), the level of 
required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definitelives are amortiz
ed on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.Our indefinite-lived in
tangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury
 , Totino’s
, Progresso
, Yoplait
, Old
El
Paso
, Yoki
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Annie’s
brands, are also tested fo r impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not berecoverable. Our estim
ate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty 
rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our finite-lived intangible
 assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indic
ate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted futurecash flows from the operat
ion and disposition of the asset are less than the car rying amount of the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and arelargely independent of oth
er assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a dis
counted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.Investments in 
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Our investments in companies ov
er which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses.We receive royalty income from certai
n joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and record the tax impact of certain jointventure operations that 
are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sellcertain raw mater
ials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.In addition, we assess our investm
ents in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, as a results of ongoing operating losses, proje
cted decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. The significantassumptions used to estimat
e fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royal ty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchangerates, and a discount rat
e. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value o
f the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fairvalue if we concluded the i
mpairment is other than temporary.

Table of ContentsRedeemable Interest
We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put al
l or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. This putoption requires us to classi
fy Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equi ty on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable bySodiaal. When the put is no longer 
exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the
 redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemptionvalue, which approximates i
ts fair value. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we ad justed the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discountedcash flow model. The signific
ant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, deprec
iation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate.Revenue Recognition
We recognize sales r
evenue when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reportednet of consumer coupon redemp
tion, trade promotion and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts.Sales, use, value-added, and othe
r excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. Coupons are recorded when distributed, bas ed on estimated redemption rates. Tradepromotions are recorded 
based on estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. We generally do not allow a right ofreturn. However, on 
a limited case-by- case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned insaleable condition is r
esold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Terms and col lection patterns vary around theworld and by channel. The allowance 
for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, asdetermined based on a rev
iew of past due balances and other spec ific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem theamount is uncollectible.
Environmental
Environmental costs rel
ating to existing conditions caused by pas t operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilities foranticipated remed
iation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later th an the completion offeasibility studies or ou
r commitment to a plan of action.Advertising Production Costs
We expense the production cos
ts of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.Research and Development
All expenditures for 
research and developmen t (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product andmanufacturing process innov
ation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies att ributable to R&Dactivities. Other costs i
nclude depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.Foreign Currency Translation
For all significant 
foreign operations, the fun ctional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the period-endexchange rates. Income stateme
nt accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are reflectedwithin accumulated othe
r comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings forthe period, except for 
gains and losses on investments in subs idiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains andlosses on instruments designat
ed as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. 
60

Table of ContentsDerivative Instruments
All derivatives are r
ecognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and are recorded in either current or non
current assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or othercomprehensive income, bas
ed on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losseson derivative instrumen
ts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceasesto 
exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period.Stock-based Compensation
We generally measure 
compensation expense for gr ants of restricted stock units using the value of a share of our stock on the date of grant. We estimate the valueof stock option grants using a Black
-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the v esting period. Our stock-basedcompensation expense is re
corded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings andallocated to each r
eportable segment in our segment results. Certain equity-based comp
ensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible emp loyees anddirectors. We consider 
a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service.Accordingly, the related 
compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awar ds granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from thegrant date to the date retirement
 eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.We report the benefi
ts of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as a financing cash flow, thereby reducing net operating cash flows andincreasing net financ
ing cash flows.Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Bene
fit, and Postemployment Benefit PlansWe sponsor several domesti
c and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Under certaincircumstances, we also prov
ide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico and members of our Board ofDirectors, including sever
ance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these b enefits that vest or accumulate withservice. Postemployment ben
efits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) arecharged to expense when 
incurred. Our postemployment b enefit plans are unfunded.We recognize the under
funded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recogn ize changes in the funded status in the yearin which the changes occur through AOCI.
Use of Estimates
Preparing our Consolidated Financi
al Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimatesand assumptions that affe
ct reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and thereported amounts of revenu
es and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible
 assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit andpostemployment benefit pla
ns. Actual results could differ from our estimates.Other New Accounting Standards
In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2015, we adopted new accounting requirements on the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a netoperating loss, a simila
r tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our results of operations or financialposition.
In the second quarter of f
iscal 2015, we adopted new accounting requirements for share-based payment awards issued based upon specific performance targets. The adoption of this guidance did not h
ave a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
61

Table of ContentsIn the first quarter o
f fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the classification of debt issuance costs presented in the balance sheet as a directreduction from the ca
rrying amount of the debt liability. This presentation change has been implemented retroactively. The adoption of this guidance did not have amaterial impact on our 
financial position. In the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, requi ring noncurrentclassification for all deferred tax
 assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position. This presentation change has been implemented retroactively. Theadoption of this guidance did not h
ave a material impact on our financia l position.NOTE 3. ACQUISITI
ON AND DIVESTITURESDuring the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016, we sold our General Mills de Venezuela CA subsidiary to a third party and exited our business in Venezuela. As a result of this transaction, we reco
rded a pre-tax loss of $37.6 million. In addition, we sold our General Mills Argentina S.A. foodservice business in Argentina to a thirdparty and recorded a pre
-tax loss of $14.8 million.During the second quarter of f
iscal 2016, we sold our North American Green Giant product lines for $822.7 million in cash, and we recorded a pre-tax gain of$199.1 million. We receiv
ed net cash proceeds of $788.0 million after transaction related costs. After the divestiture, we retained a brand intangible asset on ourConsolidated Balance Sheets of $30.1 m
illion related to our continued use of the Green
Giant
 brand in certain mark ets outside of North America.During the second quarter of f
iscal 2015, we acquired Annie’s, a publicly traded food company headquar tered in Berkeley, California, for an aggregate purchaseprice of $821.2 million, which we fund
ed by issuing debt. We consolidated Annie’s into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $589.8 million,an indefinite lived in
tangible asset for the Annie’s
 brand of $244.5 million, and a fin ite lived customer relationship asset of $23.9 million. The pro forma effects ofthis acquisition were not m
aterial.NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURI
NG, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTSINTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIR
MENTIn 
fiscal 2015, we recorded a $260.0 million charge related to the impairment of our Green
Giant
 brand intangible asset in restructuring, impairment, and other exitcosts. See Note 6 for additional 
information.RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES
We view our restructuring 
activities as act ions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of return and netpresent value targets. E
ach restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case ofmulti-year programs
), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These activities result in various restructuring costs, including assetwrite-offs, exit charg
es including severance, contract termination fee s, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructuredassets, as used in the context o
f our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense c aused by shortening the useful life orupdating the salvage value o
f depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset isrecognized immediately in 
the period the plan is approv ed.

f restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2016. This a ction was completed in fiscal 2016.As part of Century, in the third qua
rter of fiscal 2015, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our refr igerated dough capacity and exit our Midland, Ontario,Canada and New Albany, Indiana facil
ities, which support our U.S. Retail, International, and Convenience Stores and Foodservice supply chains. The Midlandaction will 
affect approximat ely 100 positions, and we expect to incur approximately $23 million of net expenses relating to this action, of which approximately$16 million will be cash. We 
recorded $2.7 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2016. We record ed $6.5 million of restructuring chargesrelating to this act
ion in fiscal 2015. The New Albany action will affect approximately 400 positions, and we expect to incur approximately $82 million of netexpenses relating to 
this action of which approxim ately $40 million will be cash. We recorded $17.1 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal2016 and $51.3 million in fiscal 2015. 
We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2018.

        Our strategies for fisc
al 2017 and fiscal 2018 will focus our growth investments on our brands and platforms with the strongest profitable growth po tential. As aresult, certain par
ts of our U.S. Retail segment could experience reduced future sales projections. We performed a sensitivity analysis for certain brand intangibleassets and determined th

brands had risk of decreasing coverage. We willcontinue to monitor these bus
inesses.In fiscal 2015, we made a str
ategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. Therefore, 
future sales and profitability projections in our long-range plan for this business declined. As a result of this triggering event, we performedan interim impair
ment assessment of the Green
Giant
 brand intangible asset as of May 31, 2015, and determined that the fair value of the brand asset no longerexceeded the carrying v
alue of the asset. Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long-range cash flow projections for the Green Giant business, an updated royalty 
rate, a weighted-average cost of capital, and a tax rate. We recorded a $260.0 million impairment charge in restructuring,impairment, and other 
exit costs in fiscal 2015 related to this asset.NOTE 7. FINANCIAL INSTRU

value and carrying amounts o f long-term debt, including the current portion, were $8,629.0 million and $8,161.1 million, respectively, as of May 29, 2016.The fair value of long-t
erm debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current in cremental borrowing rates for similartypes of instruments. Long-te
rm debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value hierarchy.RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
As a part of our ongoing 
operations, we are exposed to m arket risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity and equityprices. To manage these r
isks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established pol icies.COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Many commodities we use in the p
roduction and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients 
and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primaryobjective when entering in
to these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain.We manage our exposures through 
a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. We offset our exposur
es based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our plannedcost as possible.
We use derivatives to m
anage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting forcommodity 
derivative positions. Accord ingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statementsof Earnings.
Although we do not meet the crit
eria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providingcertainty in the futu
re price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance thesegains and losses are report
ed in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings.At that time we reclass
ify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economiceffects of 
the derivative without e xperiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.

f commodity derivatives was $295.4 million, of which $189.1 million related to agricultural inputs and $106.3 millionrelated to energy inputs. Th
ese contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to inter
est rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primaryexposures include U.S. Treasury rat
es, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forwa rd-startinginterest rate swaps, and t
reasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desiredproportion of fixed rate v
ersus floating-rate debt, based on current and proj ected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty toexchange the difference bet
ween fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.Floating Interest Rate Exposur
es — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assesse
d based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on theunderlying debt. Effectiv
e gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into e arnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses arerecorded as net inter
est. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed
-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the under
lying debt and derivatives, using incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Ineffective gainsand losses on these derivativ
es and the underlying hedged items are recorded as net inter est. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal2016, an $1.6 million gain in fisc
al 2015, and less than $1 million in fiscal 2014.In fiscal 2016, in advance of p
lanned debt financing, we entered into $400.0 million of treasury locks with an average fixed rate of 2.1 percent due February 15, 2017.
In advance of planned debt f
inancing, we entered into €600.0 million of forward starting swaps with an average fixed rate of 0.5 percent. All of these forwardstarting swaps were cash sett
led for $6.5 million in fiscal 2015, coincident with the issuance of our €500 million 8-year fixed-rate notes and €400 million 12-yearfixed-rate notes.
In fiscal 2015, we entered in
to swaps to convert $500.0 million of 1.4 percent fixed-rate notes due October 20, 2017, and $500.0 million of 2.2 percent fixed-rate notes due October 21, 2019, to floating 
rates.In advance of planned debt f
inancing, we entered into $250.0 million of treasury locks with an average fixed ra te of 1.99 percent. All of these treasury locks werecash settled for $17.9 mil
lion in fiscal 2014, coincident with the issuance of our $500.0 million 10-year fixed-rate notes.

EXCHANGE RISK Foreign currency fluctua
tions affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases, intercompany loans, product shipments, and for
eign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principalexposures are to the Austral
ian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chin ese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swissfranc. We primari
ly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign- denominated commerc
ial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity withforeign exchange exposure. The g
ains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation g ains or losses recorded in earnings on the associatedborrowings. We generally do not hedg
e more than 18 months in advance.As of 
May 29, 2016, the net notional value o f foreign exchange derivatives was $997.7 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million ineach of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.
We also have many net inves
tments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing euro- denominated commerc
ial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. In fiscal 2016, we entered into a net investment hedge for a portion of our net investmentin foreign operations denom
inated in euros by issuing €500.0 million of euro-denominated bonds. In fis cal 2015, we entered into a net investment hedge for aportion of our net investmen
t in foreign operations denominated in euros by issuing €900.0 million of euro-denominated bonds. In fiscal 2014, we entered into a net investment hedge for a por
tion of our net investment in foreign operations denominated in euros by issuing €500.0 million of euro-denominated bonds. As ofMay 29, 2016, we had deferred net for
eign currency transaction losses of $20.1 million in AOCI associat ed with hedging activity.Venezuela is a highly infl
ationary economy and as such, we remeasured the value of the assets and liabiliti es of our former Venezuelan subsidiary based on theexchange rate at which we exp
ected to remit dividends in U.S. dollars

Table of Contentsfrom the SIMADI market. In fis
cal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign exchange loss. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our General Mills deVenezuela CA subsidiary to a third 
party and exited our business in Ven ezuela.EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity price movements a
ffect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued. We useequity swaps to manage this risk. As of M
ay 29, 2016, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $113.5 million. These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2017.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANC

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTIN
GENT FEATURESCertain of our derivativ
e instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major credit rating agencies. If our 
debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivativeinstruments in net liab
ility positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments wit h credit-risk-related contingent features 
76

Table of Contentsthat were in a liabil
ity position on May 29, 2016, was $21.9 million. We have posted $7.5 million of collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-relatedcontingent features 
underlying these agreem ents had been triggered on May 29, 2016, we would have been required to post $14.4 million of collateral tocounterparties.

Includes Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc. and its affiliates.No customer other than Wal
-Mart accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated n et sales.We enter into interest rate, forei
gn exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly r ated counterparties. Wecontinually monitor our posi
tions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. Thesetransactions may expose us to 
potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We alsoenter into commodity fu
tures transactions through various regulated exchanges.The amount of loss due to the cr
edit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is $14.8 million against which we do not hold collat
eral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security to support financialinstruments subject to th
reshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trustaccount that we may acc
ess if the counterparty defaults.We 
offer certain suppliers access to a third party service that allows them to view our scheduled payments online. The third party service also allows suppliers tofinance advances on our schedu
led payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have no economic interest in these financingarrangements and no dire
ct relationship with the suppliers, the third party, or any financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable remainas obligations to 
our suppliers as stated in our supp lier agreements. As of May 29, 2016, $537.0 million of our total accounts payable is payable to suppliers whoutilize this third pa

NOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONC
ONTROLLING INTERESTSOur principal redeemab
le and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we hav
e six foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $7.0 million as of May 29, 2016.We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of th
e entities. On the acquisition date, we 
79

Table of Contentsrecorded the $904.4 million 
fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated BalanceSheets. Sodiaal has the abili
ty to put all or a portion of i ts redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjustthe value of the redee
mable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable intere st’s redemption value,which approximates its fa
ir value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends annually if it meets certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders agreement. As of May 29,2016, the 
redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $845.6 million.On the acquisition dates, we re
corded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-d enominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and 50 percentCanadian dollar-denomina
ted interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream through a 
licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to  Yoplait
  and related tradem arks. Liberté Marques Sàrl earns a royalty streamthrough licensing agreem
ents with certain Yoplait group companies for the righ ts to  Liberté
  and related tradem arks. These entities pay dividends annually basedon their available cash as
 of their fiscal year end.During fiscal 2016, we paid $74.5 mill
ion of dividends to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS and Yoplait Marques SNC shareholder agreements.A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into 
an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at market-determined prices throughJuly 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $321.0 m
illion for fiscal 2016 and $271.3 million for fiscal 2015.The holder of the GMC Class A Interests 
receives quarterly preferred distri butions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred returnrate to the holder’s capital acc
ount balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 million). On June 1, 2015, the float ingpreferred return r
ate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every threeyears through a 
negotiated agreemen t with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.For financial reporting pu
rposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and c ash flows of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries are included in our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements. The 
third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests 
in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.Our noncontrolling interests 
contain restrictive covenants. As of May 29, 2016, we were in compli ance with all of these covenants.NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Cumulative preferenc
e stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors authori
zed the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in pr

        NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS
We use broad-based stock plans 
to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 29, 2016, a total of 24.3 million shares were available 
for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of unrestricted stock under the 2011 StockCompensation Plan (2011 Plan) and the 2011 
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Dir ectors. The 2011 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock apprecia
tion rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under the 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009 stock plans, under which no furthe
r awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement,termination, or death o
f eligible employees and directors.Stock Options
The estimated fair v
alues of stock options granted and the assumpt ions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal Year    
  2016    2015    2014  Estimated fair valu
es of stock options granted   $  7.24             $  7.22            $  6.03         Assumptions:
      Risk-free interest rate
   2.4%           2.6%           2.6%        Expected term
   8.5 years     8.5 years     9.0 years  Expected volatility
   17.6%           17.5%           17.4%        Dividend yield
   3.2%           3.1%           3.1%          
             We estimate the f
air value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock 
price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using thehistorical volatility over the
 expected term of the option, excluding time per iods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating ourstock price volatili
ty. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially thosewith tenors of greater th
an 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.Our 
expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises andemployee terminat
ions within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercis e behavior and therefore were aggregated into asingle pool for valuation purpos
es. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate forperiods during the 
expected term of the op tions is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Table of ContentsAny corporate income tax ben
efit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referre d to as a windfall taxbenefit) is presented 
in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow.Realized windfall tax ben
efits are credited to additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously r
ecognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to incometax expense, potentially 
resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated  a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits forthe purpose of accounting for 
future shortfall tax benefits.Options may be priced at 100 per
cent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date of grant. Options generally expire within 10 years and one mon
th after the date of grant.Information on stock option a

ITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITSDefined Benefit Pension Plans
We have 
defined benefit pension pl ans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employeesare based on length of servi
ce and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for e ach year of credited service.Our funding policy is consistent with 
the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2016, 2015 and2014. We do not expect to 
be required to make any con tributions in fiscal 2017. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provisionthat any excess pension assets would b
e allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in contro l. All salaried employeeshired on or after June 1, 2013 ar
e eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan.Other Postretirement Bene
fit PlansWe also sponsor plans 
that provide health ca re benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried health carebenefit plan is contribu
tory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain emplo yees and retirees on anannual basis. We made $24.0 mi
llion in voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2016 and $24.0 million in voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal2015.

mation includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similarorganizations. Our i
nitial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as nec essary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations.Our initial health ca
re cost trend rate assumption is 7.5 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 7.3 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fisca l 2016. Ratesare graded down annually until 
the ultimate trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if theretirees’ benefits increase as a 
result of health care inflation . The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic viewon the rate of long-ter
m inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an importa nt effect on the amountsreported for the other p
ostretirement benefit plans.A one percentage point change 
in the health care cost trend rate would have th e following effects:

        The Patient Protection and Affo
rdable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Ac t) was signed intolaw in March 2010. The Act codifies h
ealth care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Estimates of the future impacts of several of the Act’sprovisions are incorporat
ed into our postretirement benefit liability. Postemployment Benefit Plans
Under certain circums
tances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of ourBoard of Directors, including sev
erance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulatewith service. Postemployment b
enefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based sol ely on annual pay rather than years of service) arecharged to expense when incurr
ed. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.We use our fiscal year 
end as the measurement date for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

lan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expectedfuture cash outflows to plan 
participants and, using the Aa Above M edian corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to thatindex based on our credit risk. Th
is forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

fit plan assets.Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of retur
n on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using 
input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review thisassumption annually for ea
ch plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year do es not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objectiv
e for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to particip ants at a reasonablecost to us. Our goal is to optimiz
e the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefitplan portfolios are broad
ly diversified across asse t classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investmentorganizations. For the defin
ed benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 25 percent to equities in the United Stat es; 15 percent tointernational equities; 10 
percent to private equities; 35 percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). For otherpostretirement bene
fit plans, the long-term investment policy allo cations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10percent to private equities; 
30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classesmay vary tactically around t
he long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.Contributions and Future Benefit Payments
We do not 
expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans in fiscal2017. Actual fiscal 2017 contribu
tions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake disc retionary funding of our benefit trustsand future changes in
 regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid fromfiscal 2017 to 2026 as

We have established a val
uation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of
 the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income versus capital gain income) within the carryforward period to allow us torealize these deferred tax benefits.
Of the total valuation a
llowance of $227.0 million, the majority relates to a deferred tax asset for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury acquisition in the amount of $167.9 million, $44.1 million r
elates to various state and foreign loss carryforwards, and $13.0 million relates to various foreign capital loss carryforwards. As ofMay 29, 2016, we believe it is more
-likely-than-not that the remainder of our deferred tax  assets are realizable. 
95

Table of ContentsWe have $113.1 million of tax 
loss carryforwards. Of this amount, $100.5 million is foreign loss carryforwards. The carryforward periods a re as follows: $72.6million do not expire; $4.7 m
illion expire in fiscal 2017 and 2018; and $23.2 million expire in fiscal 2019 and beyond. The remaining $12.6 million are stateoperating loss carryforwa
rds, the majority of which expire after f iscal 2024.We have not recognized a d
eferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.0 billion from our foreign operations because our subsidi aries haveinvested or will invest the und
istributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determinethe amount of unrecognized d
eferred tax liabilities on these in definitely reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operationswhen we determine that such e
arnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. In fiscal 2015, we approved a one-time repatriation of $606.1 mi llion of historicalforeign earnings to reduc
e the economic cost of funding restructuring initiatives and the acquisition of Annie’s. We recorded a discrete tax charge of $78.6 millionin fiscal 2015 related to 
this action. We have prev iously asserted that our historical foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and will only be repatriated in atax-neutral manner, 
and this one-time repatriation does not change this on-going assertion.We are subject to fed
eral income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before anuncertain tax position is 
audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertaintax position, we 
believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjus t these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light ofchanging facts and circu
mstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash.The number of years with open tax 
audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. Various tax examinat
ions by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generallyfrom 3 to 5 years.
The Internal Revenue Servic
e (IRS) is currently auditing our federal tax returns for fiscal 2013 and 2014. Several state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect thes
e examinations to result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.During 
fiscal 2014, the IRS concluded its field examination of our federal tax returns for fiscal 2011 and 2012. The audit closure and related adjustments did nothave a material i
mpact on our results of operations or financial position. As of May 29, 2016, we have effectively se ttled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years2012 and prior.
We apply a more-like
ly-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncer tain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit thathas a greater than 50 per
cent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions wil
l affect earnings in the period of such change. 
96

Table of ContentsThe following table sets for
th changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fisca l 2016 and fiscal 2015.Approximately $79 million of 
this total in fiscal 2016 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. Thisamount differs from th
e gross unrecognized tax benefits  presented in the table because certain of the liabilities below would impact deferred taxes if recognized.We also would record a decr
ease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

        As of May 29, 2016, we expect to pay approxima

imate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. The remaining amount ofour unrecognized tax liab
ility was classified in other liabilities. We report accrued in
terest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 2016, we recognized a n et benefit of $2.7million of tax-rel
ated net interest and penalties, and had $32.1 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 29, 2016. For fiscal 2015, we recognized a netbenefit of $0.2 million of 
tax-related net in terest and penalties, and had $35.2 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 31, 2015.NOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS, A
ND CONTINGENCIESThe Company’s leases are gene
rally for warehouse space and equipment. Rent expense under all operating leases from continuing operations was $189.1 million, $193.5 million, and $189.0 million in 
fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.Some operating leases requ
ire payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent inexcess of minimum rent p
ayments and sublease income netted in rent expense were insignificant.

to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $397.6 million as of May 29, 2016.NOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENT 
AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATIONWe operate in the consum
er foods industry. We have three operating segments by type of customer and geographic region as follows: U.S. Retail, 60.4 percent of our fiscal 2016 consolidated n
et sales; International, 28.0 percent of our fiscal 2016 consolidated net sales; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice, 11.6 percentof our fiscal 2016 consolidat
ed net sales.In fiscal 2015, we changed how we assess oper
ating segment performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact from hyperinflationaryeconomies. This impact is now in
cluded in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation.In fiscal 
2015, we realigned certain op erating units within our U.S. Retail operating segment. We also changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Yogurtand our Big G operating unit to Cerea
l. Frozen Foods transitioned into Meals and Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned into Snacks, Cereal, and Meals.The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. 
We revised the amounts previously reported in the net sales and net sales percentage change by operating unit within ourU.S. Retail segment to 
conform to the new operating un it structure. These realignments had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operatingsegments’ net sales, oper
ating profit, segment operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or EPS. In addition, results from th e acquired Annie’sbusiness are included in the M
eals and Snacks operating units.Our chief operating decis
ion maker continues to assess pe rformance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to our segments at the U.S. Retail,International, and Convenien
ce Stores and Foodservice operating segment level.Our U.S. Retail segment reflec
ts business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar anddiscount chains, and e-comm
erce grocery providers operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eatcereals, refrige
rated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen piz za and pizza snacks, grain, fruit andsavory snacks, and a wide variety o
f organic products including meal kits, granola bars, and cereal.

Table of ContentsOur International segmen
t consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States. Our product categories include ready-to-eat cereal s, shelf stableand frozen vegetables, m
eal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, refrigerated yogurt, grain and fruit snacks,and super-premium ice cream 
and frozen desserts. We a lso sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to consumers through owned retail shops. OurInternational segmen
t also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American marke ts, as well as productswe manufacture for sal
e to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the endcustomer is located.
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservic
e segment our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, 
and baking mixes. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell todistributors and operators 
in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and sup ermarket bakeries. Substantially all of thissegment’s operations ar
e located in the United States.Operating 
profit for these segmen ts excludes unallocated corporate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Unallocatedcorporate items inc
lude corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General MillsFoundation, asset
 and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not partof our measurement of 
segment operating perfo rmance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and lossesfrom mark-to-mark
et valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operatin g profit are centrallymanaged at the corpora
te level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chainorganization, our manufa
cturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are s ubstantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency andproductivity. As a result, fix
ed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment. Our operating segment resul

                                      During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016, we sold our General Mills de Venezuela CA subsidiary to a third party and exited our business in Venezuela. As a result of this transaction, we reco
rded a pre-tax loss of $37.6 million. In addition, we sold our General Mills Argentina S.A. foodservice business in Argentina to a thirdparty and recorded a pre
-tax loss of $14.8 million. The effective tax r
ate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 19.2 percent, primarily driven by tax credits and the impact of the divestiture of our business in Venezuela.
During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the seg
ment. Therefore, we recorded a $260 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the Green
Giant brand intangible asset. See Not
e 6 for additional information. During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2015, we approved a one-time repatriation of $606.1 million of foreign earnings and recorded a discrete income t ax charge of$78.6 million.
