Firmwide overview 
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $14.3 billion for 
the first quarter of 2021 , or $4.50 per share, on net 
revenue of $32.3 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 23% 
and ROTCE of 29%. The Firm's results for the first quarter 
of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses of $5.2 billion  compared to an increase in the 
allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion in the prior year , 
as well as a $550 million contribution to the Firm's 
Foundation.  
•Net income was $14.3 billion, up $11.4 billion.
•Total net revenue was up 14%. Noninterest revenue was 
$19.4 billion, up 40%,  predominantly driven by higher 
CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees, 
and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and 
Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in 
the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in 
the prior year. Net interest income was $12.9 billion, 
down 11%, predominantly driven by the impact of lower 
rates partially offset by balance sheet growth.   •Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion, up 12%, 
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense and continued investments in the 
businesses. The increase in expense also included a $550 
million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.
•The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $4.2 
billion driven by net reducti ons in the allowance for credit 
losses of $5.2 billion, compared to an expense of $8.3 
billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net 
additions to the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 
billion.   
•The total allowance for credit losses was $ 25.6 billion at 
March 31, 2021.  The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.42%, 
compared with 2.95% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and 
2.32% in the prior year; the decrease from the fourth 
quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions  in the 
allowance for loan losses.
•The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.3 billion at 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, an increase of $3.2 billion from the 
prior year, reflecting client credit deterioration across 
multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the 
wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans 
placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  In the first quarter of 2021, 
nonperforming assets decreased $649 million from 
December 31, 2020, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in 
the wholesale portfolio , reflecting the impact of net 
portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas 
and Individuals; and lower nonaccrual loans at fair value 
in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.  
•Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 1%, 
driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, predominantly 
offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in loans 
also reflects l oans originated under the Paycheck 
Protection Program (“PPP”) in CCB and CB.
•Firmwide average deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs  primarily 
driven by the effect of certain government actions in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
•As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High 
Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $697 
billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a 
fair value of approximately $841 billion, resulting in 
approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46  for additional 
information.

Selected capital-related metrics
•The Firm’s CET1 capital was $206 billion , and the 
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.1%  and 
13.7% , respectively.
•The Firm’s SLR was 6.7% , and without the temporary 
exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at 
Federal Reserve Banks, 5.5%.
•The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the first quarter of 2021  at 
$66.56 , up 10%  versus the prior year.
Pre-provision profit, ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP 
financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation 
of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 
16-17  for a further discussion of each of these measures.

Business Developments 
COVID-19 Pandemic
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has remained 
focused on serving its clients, customers and communities, 
as well as the well-being of its employees. 
The Firm has raised capital and provided credit to support 
its customers and clients. The Firm continues to participate 
in the Small Business Association’s (“SBA”) PPP and since 
inception of the Program has  funded approximately $40 
billion as of April 30, 2021. Whi le the Firm’s temporary 
assistance measures for those impacted by the pandemic 
have steadily declined since early 2020, the Firm continues 
to assist those impacted, primarily in the form of payment 
deferrals.
Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 47  for further information 
on PPP; Consumer Credit portfolio on pages 48-52  and 
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62  for further 
information on retained loans under payment deferral. 
Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for further information on PPP; Consumer 
Credit Portfolio on page 116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio 
on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for 
further information on retained loans under payment 
deferral.
The Firm remains focused on the well-being of its 
employees. While the vast majority of its global workforce 
continue to work from home, the Firm is actively monitoring 
the health and safety situations at local and regional levels, 
and will adapt its plans as these situations evolve.
Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic 
To address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the U.S. government as well as central banks and banking 
authorities around the world have taken and continue to 
take actions to help individuals, households and businesses 
that have been adversely affected by the economic 
disruption caused by the pandemic. In the U.S., several 
stimulus packages were enacted including the CARES Act in 
March of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act in 
December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act in 
March of 2021, which provided funding to support loan 
facilities to assist consumers and businesses and stimulus 
payments to individuals.
Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic on pages 52-53 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for further discussion on U.S. government actions 
impacting the Firm and U.S. government facilities and 
programs in which the Firm has participated. Post Brexit
Prior to December 31, 2020 the Firm substantially 
completed its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program 
which was intended to ensure the continuity of its business 
and operations with respect to EU clients. On March 26, 
2021, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a Memorandum of 
Understanding that sets out a framework for regulatory 
cooperation in relation to cross-border financial services. 
The Firm will monitor developments and take any necessary 
actions to ensure business continuity with respect to the 
Firm's EU clients. Refer to Business Developments on page 
50 of the 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.
Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority 
confirmed that the publication of the principal tenors of 
U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, 
six-month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease immediately 
following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The 
scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, 
Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and two-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31, 
2021, and the Firm is prioritizing those currencies and 
tenors of LIBOR for contract remediation in 2021.
The Firm continues to make progress on its initiatives to 
appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR 
discontinuation, including contract remediation. The Firm 
also continues to monitor the transition relief being 
considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the 
tax implications of reference rate reform.  Refer to Business 
Developments on page 51 of t he 2020 Form 10-K for a 
discussion of the Firm’s initiatives to address the expected 
discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate 
(“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the 
three months ended  March 31, 2021 and 2020 , unless otherwise specified. Factors that relate primarily to a single business 
segment are discussed in more detail within that busi ness segment's results. Refer to pages 74-76  of this Form 10-Q and pages 
152-155  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect 
the Consolidated Results of Operations.
Revenue
Three months ended March 31,
(in millions) 2021 2020 Change
Investment banking fees $ 2,970 $ 1,866  59 %

Net interest income  12,889  14,439  (11) 
Total net revenue $ 32,266 $ 28,286  14 %
(a)  Included operating lease income of $1.3 billion  and $1.4 billion  for the 
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 .
(b)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current 
presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
Investment banking fees  increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting: 
•higher equity underwriting fees largely driven by the IPO 
market due to increased industry-wide fees
•higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of 
completed transactions, in part related to transaction s 
announced in  the second half of 2020, and
•higher debt underwriting fees driven by high-yield bonds 
and leveraged loans due to increased industry-wide fees 
and wallet share gain s.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 23-27  and Note 5 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue increased, in part due to 
the absence of two significant items in the prior year:  a 
$951 million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other; and 
an $896 million markdown on held-for-sale positions, in the 
bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB .
Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue 
increased in CIB driven by strong performance in:
•Equity Markets across derivatives, Cash Equities, and 
prime brokerage, and
•Fixed Income Markets particularly in Securitized Products 
and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and 
Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong 
prior year.The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected  
net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in 
Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its 
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27   
and pages 33-34 , and Note 5 for additional information. 
Lending - and deposit-related fees  decreased reflecting:
•lower deposit-related  fees in CCB given the higher 
deposits held in existing and new accounts, 
predominantly offset by
•higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher 
lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees 
in CIB.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 , CIB on pages 
23-27  and CB on pages 28-29 , respectively, and Note 5 for 
additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue  increased driven by higher asset management fees  
as a result of:
•strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity 
products and h igher average market levels, net of 
liquidity  fee waivers,  in AWM,  and to a lesser extent, 
•higher level s of investment assets on higher average 
market levels  and net inflows  in CCB.
Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 20-22  and 
pages 30-32 , respectively, and Note 5 for information on 
asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue.
Investment  securities gains in both periods reflected the 
impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio . 
Refer to Corporate segment result s on pages 33-34  and 
Note 9 for information on investment securities gains.
Mortgage fees and related income  increased 
predominantly due to  higher mortgage production revenue 
reflecting higher production margins and volumes.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 , Note 5 and 
14 for further information.
Card income  increased driven by lower acquisition costs, 
and higher net interchange income in CCB , with debit and 
credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels. 
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22  and Note 5 
for further information.
9
Other income  decreased reflecting:
•Weather-related write-downs on certain renewable 
energy investments, as well as increased amortization on 
a higher level of alternative energy investments in the 
tax-oriented investment portfolio  in CIB. The increased 
amortization was m ore than offset by lower income tax 
expense from the associated tax credits
•lower gains on certain Corporate investments, and
•lower operating lease income from a decline in auto 
operating lease volume in CCB,
partially offset by
•net valuation gains on certain investments, compared 
with losses in the prior year, in AWM, and 
•the absence of  losses on certain equity investments in CIB 
in the prior year.
Net interest income decreased predominantly driven by the 
impact of lower rates, partially offset by balance sheet 
growth.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.1 
trillion, up $661 billion,  predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, a nd the yield 
was 1.87%, down 127 basis points (“bps”), primarily due 
to lower rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE 
basis, was 1 .69%, a decrease of 68 bps. The net yield 
excluding CIB Markets was 1.93%, down 108 bps.
Net yield on an FTE basis, and n et yield excluding CIB 
Markets are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the 
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates 
schedule on page 162  for further details; and the 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17  for a further 
discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.Provision for credit losses
Three months ended March 31,
(in millions) 2021 2020 Change
Consumer, excluding credit card $ (984) $ 619 NM
Credit card  (2,517)  5,063 NM
Total consumer  (3,501)  5,682 NM
Wholesale  (671)  2,594 NM
Investment securities  16  9  78 %
Total provision for credit losses $ (4,156) $ 8,285 NM
The provision for credit losses  decreased driven by net 
reductions in both the consumer and wholesale allowance 
for credit losses. 
The decrease in consumer  was driven by:
•a $4.5 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
including $3.5 billion in Card reflecting improvements in 
the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and $625 million in 
Home Lending primarily due to  the continued 
improvement in home price index ("HPI") expectations 
and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and
•lower net charge-offs predominantly  in Card , reflecting 
lower charge-offs and higher recoveries primarily 
benefiting from payment assistance and government 
stimulus;
•the prior year included a $4.4 bill ion addition to the 
allowance for credit losses. 
The decrease in wholesale  reflects a net reduction of $716 
million in the allowance for credit losses across the L OBs 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
scenarios.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 , CIB on pages 
23-27 , CB on pages 28-29 , AWM on pages 30-32 , the 
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 , and Note s 9 
and 12 for additional information on the credit portfolio 
and the allowance for credit losses.

(a)Included Firmwide legal exp ense  of $28 million and $197 million  for 
the three months ended March 31, 2021  and 2020 , respectively.
(b)Included FDIC -related expense of $201 million  and $99 million  for the 
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively.
Compensation expense  increased predominantly driven by 
higher revenue- related expense  in CIB, as well as the impact 
of investments in the businesses.
Noncompensation  expense  increased as a result of:
•higher contribution expense, which included a $550 
million donation of equity investments to the Firm's 
Foundation
•higher investments in the businesses, including 
technology, and
•higher FDIC-related expense  largely driv en by balance 
sheet growth ,
partially offset by
•lower legal expense, predominantly in CIB, and
•lower other structural  expense, including lower travel and 
entertainment across the businesses and lower operating 
losses.
Other volume- and revenue-related expense was relatively 
flat as the increase in brokerage expense in CIB and 
distribution expense in AWM was offset by lower 
depreciation from the decline in auto lease assets in CCB.Income tax expense
(in millions)Three months ended March 31,
2021 2020 Change
Income before income tax expense $ 17,697 $ 3,210  451 %

Effective tax rate(a) 19.2 %  10.7 %
(a)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current 
presentation.  Refer to Note 1 for further information.
The effective tax rate  increased driven by a higher level of 
pre-tax income that also reduced the relative impact of 
certain tax benefits, as well as the resolution of certain tax 
audits .

Total assets $ 3,689,336 $ 3,384,757  9 %
(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks  
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in 
deposits  and lower  opportunities in Treasury and CIO to 
deploy funds in securities purchased under resale 
agreements.  Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s 
placements of its excess cash with various central banks, 
including the Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements  decreased driven by the lower deployment of 
funds in Treasury and CIO; and in CIB lower client-driven 
market- making activities, partially offset by higher demand 
for securities to cover short positions.  Refer to Liquidity 
Risk Management on pages 42-46  and Note 10 for 
additional information.
Securities borrowed  increased driven by client-driven 
activities in Fixed Income Financing and Equity Markets, and 
higher demand for securities to cover short positions in CIB. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46  and 
Note 10 for additional information.
Trading assets  increased  due to strong client-driven 
market-making activities in equity instruments in CIB 
Markets, including prime brokerage.  Refer to Notes 2 and 4 
for additional information.
Investment securities  increased, reflecting net purchases 
of U.S. Treasuries in the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio 
predominantly offset by a decrease in the available-for-sale 
("AFS") portfolio. The decrease in AFS was due to paydowns  
and net val uation losses , partially offset by net purchases.Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 , 
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 65 , and 
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information on Investment 
securities.
Loans  were flat as :
•the reduction in Card due to the impact of seasonality,  
and higher payment rates; lower loans in CB; and net 
paydowns in Home Lending
were offset by
•the origination of PPP loans in CBB and CB; growth in CIB 
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, and in AWM 
securities-based and custom lending, as well as 
mortgages . 
The allowance for loan losses  decreased consisting of :
•a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential 
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued 
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser 
extent portfolio run-off , and  
•an $875 million net reduction in wholesale, across the 
LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroeconomic scenarios.
There was a $107 million addition to the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, which is included in other 
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The total net 
reduction to the allowance for credit losses was $5.2 
billion, as of March 31, 2021.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
47-65 , and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Accrued  interest and accounts receivable  increased 
largely due to higher client receivables related to client-
driven activities in CIB prime brokerage.Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles  increased driven by 
higher MSRs as a result of lower prepayment speeds on 
higher rates, as well as net additions to the MSRs.  Refer to 
Note 14 for additional information.
Other assets  increased predominantly due to the impact of 
securitie s financing transactions i n CIB prime brokerage, as 
well as higher cash collateral placed with central 
counterparties ("CCPs"). Refer to Note 10 for additional 
information on securities lending transactions.

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
Deposits  increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the 
effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID 19 pandemic. I n CCB, the increase was also driven by 
lower spending, as well as growth from existing and new 
accounts  across both consumer and small business 
customers . Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
42-46  and Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements  increased reflecting:
•higher secured financing of  AFS investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading assets in CIB, 
and 
•the im pact of client activities in CIB.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46  and 
Note 10 for additional information.
Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher 
financing of prime brokerage activities , and net issuance of 
structured notes in CIB,  as well as the issuance of 
commercial paper in Treasury and CIO. Refer to pages 
42-46  for information on changes in Liquidity Risk 
Management. Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which 
resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt 
instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables as 
a result of market movements.  Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for 
additional information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities  increased largely  
due to  the impact of securities financing transactions in CIB 
prime brokerage.  Refer to Note 10 for additional 
information on securities lending transactions.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs  decreased 
driven by lower issuances as a result of lower loan balances 
in the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Refer to Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 15 and Notes 13 and 
22 for further information on  Firm -sponsored VIEs and loan 
securitization trusts .
Long -term debt  was relatively flat as maturities and fair 
value hedge accounting adjustments related to higher rates 
were offset by net issuances. Refe r to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 42-46  for additional information.  
Stockholders’ equity  was relatively flat as  net income was 
offset by the impact of capital actions and a de crease in 
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The 
decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of higher rates 
on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow hedges. Refer 
to page 82  for information on changes in stockholders’ 
equity, Capital actions on pages 39-40 , and Note 19 for 
additional information on AOCI.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that 
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 
Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities 
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). 
The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts 
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.
The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions 
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. 
The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements 
can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 79-83 .
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
l e v e l .   T h e s e  n o n - G A A P  m e a s u r e s  i n c l u d e :
•Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 
overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities ( “FTE” 
basis)•Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 
less total noninterest  expense
•Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets
•TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS
•Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 
excluding trade finance and conduits.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.
The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17  for a 
definition of managed basis.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses 
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an 
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business 
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and 
analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment  is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as 
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refe r to Line of business equity on  page 39 , and  page 98  of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information on capital allocation.
Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66  of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for a further discussion 
of those methodologies.

respectively.Quarterly results
Net income was $6.7 billion , up $6.5 billion, driven by a 
decrease in the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $12.5 billion , a decrease of 6%. 
Net interest income was $7.9 billion , down 14% , driven by:
•the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, lower 
loans in Card due to the cumulative impact of lower spend 
throughout 2020 and higher  payment rates, and lower 
loans in Home Lending due to net paydow ns,
partially offset by
•growth in deposits in CBB.
Noninterest revenue was $4.6 billion , up 12% , driven by:
•higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 
production  margins and volumes, and 
•higher  card income due to  lower acquisition costs and 
higher net interchange income, with debit and credit card 
sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels,
partially offset b y
•lower deposit-related fees  given the higher deposits held 
in existing and new accounts , and
•lower auto lease volume.
Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income .
Noninterest expense  was $7.2 billion , relatively flat, 
reflecting:
•higher investments in the business
offset by 
•lower structural expenses, and
•lower volume- and revenue-related expense, including 
lower depreciation on auto lease assets.
The provision for credit losses  was a net benefit of $3.6 
billion , compared with an expense of $5.8 billion  in the prior 
year, driven by:
•a $4.6 billion reduction  in the allowance for credit losses, 
primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm's  
macroeconomic scenarios, consisting of $3.5 billion in 
Card, $625 million in Home Lending, primarily due to the 
continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a 
lesser extent portfolio run-off, $350 million in CBB and 
$150 million in Auto, and
•lower net charge-offs  in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs 
and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment 
assistance and government stimulus.
The prior year included a $4.5 billion net ad dition  to the 
allowance for credit losses .
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
47-65  and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64  for

(a)At March 31, 2021  and 2020 , nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 
90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of 
$458 million  and $616 million , respectively.  These amounts have been 
excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(b)At March 31, 2021  and 2020 , excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $557 million  and $1.0 billion , respectively, that 
are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based 
upon the government guarantee.
(c)Generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs 
offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit 
Portfolio on pages 48-52  for further information on consumer payment 
assistance activity. The first quarter of 2021 includes loans to customers 
that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or 
more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-
dependent. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the lower of 
amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.
(d)At March 31, 2021 , included $23.4 billion  of loans in Business Banking 
under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm 
does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to 
Credit Portfolio on page 47  for a further discussion of the PPP.
(e)At March 31, 2021 , the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card 
and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic were $8.1 billion , $105 million  and $127 million , 
respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms 
are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit 
Portfolio on pages 48-52  for further information on consumer payment 
assistance activity.

Quarterly  results
Net income was $5.7 billion , up 189% .
Net revenue was $14.6 billion , up 46% .
Banking revenue was $4.5 billion , up 70% .
•Investment Banking revenue was $2.9 billion , up 222% , 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 57%, 
reflecting higher fees across products, and the absence of 
prior year markdowns on held-for-sale positions in the 
bridge financing portfolio. The Firm ranked #2 for Global 
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.
–Equity underwriting fees were $1.1 billion , up 219% , 
largely driven by the IPO market due to increased 
industry-wide fees.
–Debt underwriting fees were $1.3 billion , up 17% , 
driven by high yield bonds and leveraged loans due to 
increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains.
–Advisory fees were $680 million , up 35% , driven by a 
higher number of completed transactions, in part 
related to transactions announced in the second half of 
2020.
•Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.4 billion , down 2%, 
driven by deposit margin compression, predominantly 
offset by the impact of higher deposit balances.
•Lending revenue  was $265 million , down 24% , 
predominantly driven by fair value gains on hedges of 
accrual loans in the prior year.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $10.1 billion , up 
37% . Markets revenue was $9.1 billion , up 25% .
•Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.8 billion , up 15% , 
predominantly driven by strong performance in 
Securitized Products and Credit, largely offset by lower 
23
revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets 
compared to a strong prior year.
•Equity Markets revenue was $3.3 billion , up 47% , driven 
by strong performance across  derivatives, Cash Equities, 
and prime brokerage.
•Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion , down 2%, 
with deposit margin compression largely offset by deposit 
balance growth.
•Credit Adjustments & Other was a  loss of $3 million , 
compared with a loss of $951 million  in the prior year 
which was predominantly driven by funding spread 
widening on derivatives .
Noninterest expense was $7.1 billion , up 19% , 
predominantly driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation expense, partial ly offset by lower legal 
expense.
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $331 
million, driven by a net reduction  in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $1.4 billion in the 
prior year.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 
and 6 for a description of the composition of these income 
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 74 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for further 
information.
For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results
Net in come was $1.2 billion , up $1.0 billion, predominantly 
driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses .
Net revenue was $2.4 billion , up 11% . Net interest income 
was $1.5 billion , down 5%, driven by deposit margin 
compression, predominantly  offset by higher dep osit 
balances and l ending revenue  due to increased portfolio 
spreads. Noninterest revenue was $917 million , up 51% , 
predominantly driven by higher investment banking 
revenue, the absence of prior year markdowns in the bridge 
financing portfolio, and higher deposi t-related fees, 
particularly cash management fees.    
Noninterest expense was $969 million , down 2%, driven by 
lower structural expense .    
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $118 
million , driven by a net reduc tion in the allowance for credit  
losses, compared with an expense of $1.0 billion in the 
prior year.

•higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset 
management fees, loan margin expansion  and an 
investment valuation gain , 
largely offset by 
•deposit margin compression. 
Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion , up 6% 
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, partially offset by lower structural 
expense. 
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $121 
million , driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses.

47-65  and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64  for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

(a)Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income 
from municipal bonds, of $67 million  and $61 million  for the three 
months ended  March 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively.Quarterly results
Net loss was $580 million  compared with a net loss of $125 
million  in the prior year.
Net revenue was a loss of $473 million , down $639 million. 
The decrease was driven by:
•lower net interest income on lower rates, as well as 
limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to 
continued deposit growth,
partially offset by 
•higher noninterest revenue reflecting net gains on certain 
legacy private equity investments compared with net 
losses in the prior year, offset by lower investment 
securities gains reflecting the impac t of repositioning the 
investment securities portfolio, as well as lower gains on 
certain Corporate investments.
Noninterest expense of $876 million  was up $730 million 
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's 
Foundation and higher structural expense. 
The current period income tax benefit was driven by the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes  as well as the 
impact of the Firm’s estimated full-year expected tax rate 
relative to the level of year-to-date pretax income, partially 
offset by the resolution of certain tax audits.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm.  
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 
•Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 
•Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 
•Firmwide structures for risk governance. 
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 
Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.
Refer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K 
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management 
governance and oversight.Risk governance and oversight functions
The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2020

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 
The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. 
Refer to pages 91-101  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and 
stress testing.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S.  Bank Holding Companies 
("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured 
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries,  including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of 
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), 
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive 
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a 
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an 
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the 
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is 
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approac hes compared to their respective 
minimum capital ratios.  
The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios.  
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the  SLR. Refer to SLR o n page 39  for additional 
information.
Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition delay . As part of their 
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided 
the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of 
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a 
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022  
(“CECL capital transition provisions”).  
The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 
2021, the capital metrics of  the Firm exclude $4.5 billion , 
which is the $2.7 billion  day 1 impact to retained earnings 
and 25% of the $7.0 billion  increase in the allowance for 
credit losses  from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances 
on PCD loans).   The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have 
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, and total leverage exposure.  Refer to Capital Risk 
Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL 
capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting 
guidance.  
SLR temporary revision.  The Federal Reserve issued an 
interim final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the 
calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of 
calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude 
the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities 
and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions 
became effective April 1, 2020, and remained in effect 
through March 31, 2021.   
On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (" OCC") and FDIC  issued an 
interim final rule  which became effective April 1, 2020  and 
remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides 
IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary 
exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31, 
2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this 
exclusion.
PPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued 
an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 
2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of 
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by 
applying a zero percent ris k weight to loans originated 
under the program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by 
the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit 
losses on these loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had 
approximately $32 billion of loans under the program.  
Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
(“PPPL”) Facility, which would allow the Firm to exclude 
them under the final rule.  
TLAC Holdings rule . On October 20, 2020, the federal 
bank ing agencies issued a final rule prescribing the 
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain 
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing 
capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital 
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC 
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking 
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 
and is not  expected to have  a material impact on the Firm’s 
risk-based capital metrics.

Common stock
On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic 
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm 
temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. 
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, 
including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases 
through the end of 2020.  On December 18, 2020, the 
Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including 
the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in 
the first quarter of 2021.  Subsequently, t he Firm 
announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new 
common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion.  As 
directed by the Federal Reserve, total  net repurchases and 
common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021 were 
restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s 
net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.  On 
March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these 
restrictions through at least the second quarter of 2021.

Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
On April 5, 2021, the Firm submitted its 2021 Capital Plan 
to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2021 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") 
process. The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve will 
disclose the Firm’s indicative Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") 
requirement which will become effective October 1, 2021 
and summary information regarding the Firm’s stress test 
results by July 1, 2021.  The Firm's SCB is currently 3.3%. 
Based on the Federal Reserve's March 25, 2021 
announcement, if the Firm remains above all of its 
minimum risk-based capital requirements based on the 
2021 CCAR stress test results, the temporary restrictions on 
capital distributions currently in effect will expire as 
planned on June 30, 2021 . However, if the Firm falls below 
any of its minimum risk-ba sed requirements in the 2021 
CCAR stress test it will remain subject to the temporary 
restrictions through at least September 30, 2021.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its 
assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108  of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible  HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress.  Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible 
HQLA held by  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of 
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is 
not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded 
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.  The LCR  for both the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%.  Refer to page 103  of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports 
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended  
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, December 31, 2020 and M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0

The Firm’s average LCR was 110% for the three months 
ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 .
The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months 
ended March 31, 2021, compared with the prior year period 
primarily due to the relative impact on net cash outflows from 
a significant increase in deposits.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during 
the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with both 
the three month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 
March 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. D eposits 
continued to increase in the first quarter primarily driven by 
the effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is exclude d from the Firm’s 
reported LCR under the LCR rule.
The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due 
to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash 
outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.  
Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA 
above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, 
such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes 
would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities 
included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately 
$841 billion  and $740 billion  as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively , although the amount of 
liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on 
prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased 
compared to December 31, 20 20, primarily due to an 
increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess 
eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was 
primarily a result of increased deposits.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at  the Federal 
Home Loan Banks (" FHLBs ") and the discount window at the 
Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the 
Firm to such banks of approximately  $301 billion  and $307 
billion  as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of 
cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or 
other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at 
the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central 
banks.  Although available, the Firm does not view this 
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and the other central banks as a primary source of 
liquidity.
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is intended 
to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required” 
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On 
October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final 
NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as 
the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 
100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become 
effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to 
publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually 
beginning in 2023. 
The Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100% 
minimum NSFR  which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based 
on its current understanding of the final rule.
42
Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity.  Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from  the 
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company 
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily 
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by  Treasury and CIO  in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term 
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity 
risk characteristics.  
Deposits

Total Firm $ 2,278,112 $ 2,144,257 $ 2,224,632 $ 1,636,186 
Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.  
The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of

generally more representative of deposit trends than

periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.
Average deposits increased for the three months ended 
March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended 
March 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the 
LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government 
actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . In CCB, the 
increase was also driven by lower spending, as well as 
growth from existing and new accounts across both 
consumer and small business customers.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.  
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, compared with D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
reflecting higher secured financing of AFS investment 
securities in Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading 
assets in CIB, and  the impact of client activities in CIB.The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.
The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist 
of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale 
commercial paper.  The increase in commercial paper at 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 was due to 
higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity 
management. 
44
Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable 
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, 
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, 
including  TLAC . Long-term funding objectives include 
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various 
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its 
optimal long-term funding plan.  
The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured 
funding is issued by  the Parent Company to provide 
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary 
funding needs.  The Parent Company advances substantially 
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC.  The IHC 
does not issue debt to external counterparties.  The 
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance 
and maturities or redemptions for the three  months ended 
March 31, 2021 and 2020 . Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 102–108  and Note 20 of JPMorgan 
Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K for additional information on the 
IHC and long-term debt.

to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
further description of the client-driven loan securitizations.
45
Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 15 , and 
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 
4 for additional information on the impact of a credit 
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, 
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1,

agencies of $798 million  and $874 million , respectively, and real estate 
owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government agencies of $8 million  and $9 
million , respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the 
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt 
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by 
regulatory guidance.
The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The 
majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications 
have not been considered troubled debt restructurings 
(“TDRs ”). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, 
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers 
and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due or 
nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on

Paycheck Protection Program
The Firm continues to participate in the PPP, for which the 
application deadline was extended to May 31, 2021. At 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the Firm had 
approximately $32 billion and $27 billion of loans under the 
PPP, respectively, including $23 billion and $19 billion in the 
consumer portfolio, and $9 billion and $8 billion in the 
wholesale portfolio. T he impact on  interest income related to 
PPP loans was not material for the three months ended 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to 
forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the 
forgiveness amount from the SBA. The Firm continues to 
process forgiveness applications and through March 31, 
2021, approximately  $7 billion of loans were forgiven.
Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase 's 
2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion on the PPP.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO
The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of 
residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto 
and business banking loans , as well as associated lending-
related commitments.  The Firm’s focus is on serving 
primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. 
In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic 
environment continued to improve. The credit performance 
of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, 
benefited from government stimulus programs, payment 
deferrals and increasing home prices.  The Firm may obtain credit protection against certain pools of loans in the 
retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit 
linked notes . Refer  to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q; and 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114-120 and Note 12 of 
JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information 
on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and 
charge-off accounting policies.  Refer to Note 22 of this Form 
10-Q a nd Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K  for

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing  assistance to 
customers in response to the  COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals.
As of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm had $9.3 billion of retained 
loans under payment deferral programs, which represented 
a decrease of approximately $1.5 billion from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020 , $3.0 billion from September 30, 2020 and $19.0 
billion from June 30, 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, 
there were approximately $886 million of new enrollments in payment deferral programs predominantly in residential 
real estate and credit card . Predominantly all borrowers that 
exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm 
continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans 
subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period 
and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to 
resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers 
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these 
loans in its allowance for credit losses.

Predominantly all borrowers, including those with loans 
accounted for as TDRs , were current upon enrollment in 
payment deferral programs and are expected to exit 
payment deferral programs in a current status, either 
because no payments are contractually due during the 
deferral period or because payments originally contractually 
due during the deferral period will be due at maturity upon 
exit. For those borrowers that are unable to resume making 
payments in accordance with the original or modified 
contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from 
deferral programs, they will be placed on nonaccrual status 
in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit 
cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and charged off or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies. 
Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances increased from December 31, 2020 driven 
by higher loans in auto and other reflecting PPP loan 
originations, partially offset by lower residential real estate 
loans.
Residential real estate:  The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit. 
The retained loan portfolio declined from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020  due to paydowns predominantly in Home Lending 
which were largely offset by originations of prime mortgage 
loans in Home Lending and AWM . Retained n onaccrual  
loans were relatively flat from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. Net 
recoveries  for the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
were lower when compared with the same period in the 
prior year as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a 
loan sale in Home Lending.
The loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value portfolio 
increased  from December  31, 2020 largely driven by 
warehouse loans in Home Lending. Nonaccrual loans  at fair 
value decreased from December 31, 2020 largely due to 
sales in CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $22.2 billion  at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. This 
amount included $8.6 billion  of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $7.3 billion  of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030 . The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.
At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the carrying 
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were 
$25.9 billion  and $25.6 billion , respectively. These loans 
have an interest-only payment period generally followed by 
an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. C harge-off s for the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  
2021  were consistent with the broader residential 
mortgage portfolio as the perf ormance of this portfolio is 
generally in line with the performance of the broader 
residential mortgage portfolio .The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale 
and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to 
certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to 
government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back 
into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform 
become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 13 for additional 
information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with 
Ginnie Mae.
(b)At both M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, nonaccrual loans

90 days past due. Refer to Note 11 for additional information about 
loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared 
with D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 due to PPP loan originations net 
of forgiveness in Business Banking as well as from growth in 
the auto portfolio from loan originations, largely offset by 
paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent 
loans . The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 
0.13%  and 0.41%  for the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  
2021  and 2020 , respectively. Auto charge-offs for the 
three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 benefited from 
government stimulus, payment assistance programs , and 
high vehicle collateral values.

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 
reflecting the impact of seasonality as well as higher 
payment rates . The M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 1.40%  and 0.80% , respectively, 
decreased compared to the D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68%  and 0.92% , 
respectively. The delinquency rates were positively 
impacted by borrowers who received payment assistance 
and government stimulus. Net charge-offs decreased for the 
three  months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 compared with the 
same period in the prior year reflecting lower charge-offs 
and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment 
assistance and government stimulus.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.
Modifications of credit card loans
At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm had $1.3 billion  of credit card 
loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which 
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to 
$1.4 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. Refer to Note 11 for 
additional information about loan modification programs to 
borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 55-59  for further information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well a s risk-rated  
exposures held in CCB including business banking and auto 
dealer for which the wholesale methodology is applied 
when determining the allowance for credit losses.
In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic 
environment continued to improve following the broad-
based credit deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, retained loans remained relatively 
flat while lending related commitments increased $31.4 
billion from December 31, 2020 to $481.2 billion, driven 
by net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase 
in held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.
In the three months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the 
investment- grade percentage of the credit portfolio 
decreased from 71%  to 69%  driven by net portfolio 
activity , incl uding new commitments . Criticized exposure 
increased $5.3 billion  from $41.6 billion  at December 31, 
2020 to $46.9 billion  at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, driven by select 
downgrades , partially offset by select upgrades. 
Nonperforming exposure was relatively flat at $4.9 billion 
and net charge off activity was $53 million.Wholesale credit portfolio

Wholesale assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals and 
covenant modifications.
As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had approximately $1.3 
billion of retained loans still under payment deferral, 
representing 0.25% of the loan portfolio which  has 
decreased approximately $0.3 billion from December 31, 
2020, $5.0 billion from September 30, 2020, and $15.5 
billion from June 30, 2020.  Predominantly all clients that exited deferral are current  or have paid down their loans, 
and the Firm has not experienced significant new payment 
deferral requests.  The Firm continues to monitor the credit 
risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout 
the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the 
borrowers are required to resume making regularly 
scheduled payments and considers expected losses of 
principal and accrued interest on these loans in its 
allowance for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment 
deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant 
or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and 
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans  under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the 
Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly  all of these loans were considered 
performing .

BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the 
internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on

changes in market conditions.
Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of 
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist 
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-
for-sale and loans at fair value, was $46.9 billion  at 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, compared with $41.6 billion  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, representing approximately 4.4% and 
4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The 
increase in total criticized exposure was driven by select 
downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades . The total 
criticized exposure was largely undrawn and $42.8 billion 
was performing.

Oil & Gas exposure was $41.5 billion  as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, including $20.4 billion  of Exploration & Production and Oil field 
Services as shown in the table below. During the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the investment-grade percentage 
decreased from 47%  to 42% , as a result of new non-investment grade commitments. However, criticized exposure decreased 
by $472 million  from $5.7 billion  to $5.3 billion , driven by select upgrades and net portfolio activity, largely offset by select 
downgrades.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.
The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
and 2020 . Since March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loan exposure 
increased $1.5 billion, driven by downgrades across 
multiple industries on client credit deterioration, with the 
largest concentration in Real Estate, predominantly within 
Retail and Lodging. In the three months ended March 31, 
2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $390 million, 
when compared to December 31, 2020 driven by net 
portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas and 
Individuals.

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily 
marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this 
collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally  
held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the 
Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the 
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires 
clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to 
reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are 
reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on 
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty 
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the 
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives 
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter 
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed 
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the 
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from 
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable 
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative 
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding 
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically 
covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily 
— was approximately 88%  at both M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of 
derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $73.1 billion  and $79.6 
billion  at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market 
movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value 
of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally 
enforceable master netting agreements and the related 
cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held 
liquid securities and other cash collateral that the Firm 
believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security 
when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s 
favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets 
as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the 
appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take 
into consideration other collateral, which generally 
represents securities that do not qualify as high quality 
liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the Firm believes 
is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each 
counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables 
for the counterparty. The following tables summarize the 
net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile 
for the periods presented.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the table above, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative 
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.
Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures. Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management activities"). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain o ff-balance  sheet 
lending-related commitments.  The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and
•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is 
recognized within Investment Securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance 
The allowance for credit losses as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
decreased when compared to  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
consisting of:
•a $4.5 billion  reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential 
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued 
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser 
extent portfolio run-off, and
•a $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the 
LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroecono mic scenarios 
While the economy is showing signs of improvement, t he 
COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the 
Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not 
experienced in recent history, which has created additional 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and 
increased the reliance on management judgment. These 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates 
remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 
2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range 
of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have 
been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately 
address these economic circumstances.
Further, despite the improvement in the economy,  
uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying 
labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, 
and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that 
could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a 
result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place 
significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in 
weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above 
eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six 
percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S.  gross domestic product ("GDP") returning to pre-pandemic levels 
in 1Q22.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:  
Assumptions at March 31, 2021
2Q21 4Q21 2Q22
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 5.7 %  4.8 %  4.3 %
Cumulative change in U.S. real 
GDP from 12/31/2019  0.2 %  2.7 %  4.3 %
Assumptions at December 31, 2020
2Q21 4Q21 2Q22
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 6.8 %  5.7 %  5.1 %
Cumulative change in U.S. real 
GDP from 12/31/2019  (1.9) %  0.6 %  2.0 %
(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates 
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future 
periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held non-traded financial 
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. 
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended 
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for 
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $595.4 billion , and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 33-34  and Note 9 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 66-70  for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
42-46  for further information on related liquidity risk.Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-
traded financial instruments representing ownership or 
other forms of junior capital and span multiple asset 
classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In 
general,  principal investments include tax-oriented 
investments and investments made to enhance or 
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies . The Firm’s 
investments will continue to evolve in line with its 
strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support 
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.  
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results. T he aggregate carrying values of the 
principal investment portfolios have not been significantly 
affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 
uncertainties remain that could result in future negative 
impacts.
The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of 
the principal investment portfolios as M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 135–142  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities 
that give rise to market risk. 
Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures 
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur, such as those observed at the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 73 .
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time.  Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”),  a statistical 
risk measure , to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.  
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events.  The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.
Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K 
for further information regarding VaR, including the 
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,  for 
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

Quarter over quarter results
Average tot al VaR increased by $10 million  for the three 
months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 when compared with the 
prior quarter  driven by increases in exposure in fixed 
income, partially offset by volatility which occurred in late 
March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pande mic 
rolling out of the one-year historical look-back period.
Year over year results
Average total VaR increased by $47 million  for the three 
months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, compared with the same 
period in the prior year. This increase was driven by 
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic and predominantly impacted exposure in fixed 
income, as well as increases from Corporate  VaR due to the 
inclusion of a private equity position that became publicly 
traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020 . These 
increases were partially offset by risk reductions in equities.Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to 
exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected 
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based 
measures to more effectively measure the risk from these 
loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total 
VaR and each of the components would have been higher

However, as of March 31, 2021 daily Risk Management VaR has declined from March 31, 2020 as the volatility which occurred

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily  VaR model backtesting , which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and  losses  depicted in the chart below do not reflect the 
Firm’s reported revenue  as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of 
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income.  These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset 
backtesting gains and losses on a particular day.  The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
For the 12 months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 165 of the 259 days, and observed two VaR 
backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 47 of the 63 days, 
and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions.
The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting  gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The daily  backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily 
Risk Management VaR. The count  of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A 
backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. 
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent.  The results in the chart 
below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s  Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and 
issuing debt as well as from the investment securities 
portfolio.  Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.
One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk 
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long -
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures  as described on page 
136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:
•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any 
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience.
•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these 
scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid, due 
to repricing lags and other factors.The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 7  for additional information).
The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table 
below.

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 compared to D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 reflected 
updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-term rates as 
well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.
The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets 
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.
Based upon current and implied market rates as of 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, scenarios reflecting lower rates could 
result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never 
experienced an interest rate environment where the 
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. While 
the impact of negative interest rates on the Firm's earnings-
at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward of 
up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest income. 
In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling 
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require 
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual 
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.
The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the 
table below.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario 
involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 
by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current 
levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at  
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net 
revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to 
the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, as the movement in market 
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these 
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.
Given the remaining uncertainty around the COVID-19 
pandemic, Country Risk Management continues to monitor 
the impact to individual countries.
Refer to pages 143-144  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.
Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and their 
comparative exposures as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows.
The increase in exposure to Australia was predominantly  
due to increased cash placements with the central bank of 
Australia, driven by client activity following recent policy 
decisions in the country and growth in client deposits .Top 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.)(a)

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems; Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates.  Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147  of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 
148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk 
Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples 
of operational risks are provided below.
Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected 
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, 
health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees and 
customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency 
program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its 
critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, 
technology and facilities) in the event of a business 
interruption. The program includes governance, awareness 
training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as 
strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and 
manage business interruption and public safety risks. The 
strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program 
has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s 
business operations during and after various events.Cybersecurity Risk
Due to the on-going impact of COVID-19, th e Firm c ontinues 
to leverage use of remote access and also video 
conferencing solutions provided by third parties to facilitate 
remote work. As a result, the Firm deployed additional 
precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.
Payment Fraud Risk
The risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level 
across the industry, particularly during the COVID-19 
pandemic due to the use of contingent forms of payment 
authentication methods and the perpetuation of scams 
involving the pandemic, including an increase in the level of 
fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of 
these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators 
continue to evolve. The Firm employs various controls for 
managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee 
and client education and awareness trainings. 
72
ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.
The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- 
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
and making business decisions.
While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly 
different from the historical macroeconomic environments 
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than 
in typical periods.   
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 74-76  and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations 
and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.
73
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorgan Chase ’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),
•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and
•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2020 Form 10-K for further information on these 
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies 
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; 
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63–64  and 
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are 
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty 
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by 
portfolio and geography.
•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.
•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices 
and HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.
The COVID-19 pandemic  resulted in a weak labor market 
and weak overall economic conditions that  affected 
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale 
lending portfolios. While the economy is showing signs of 
improvement, uncertainties remain, including the health of 
underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus 
strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior 
that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. 
Further, significant judgment is still required to estimate 
the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery. 
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.
For example , compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
described on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 2.4% higher 
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 4.4% in the third quarter of 2021; lower 
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining 2.6% lower 
at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak 
difference of nearly 6.6% in the third quarter of 2021; and 
lower national HPI with a peak difference of  17.4% and  a 
trough in the second quarter of 2022.
74
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:
•the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse 
scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as 
of March 31, 2021, and accordingly, the existing 
allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those 
estimated under the central scenario
•the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables
•the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs  used in 
the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees 
not seen in recent history, which continues to add higher 
degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss 
estimations 
•significant changes in the expected severity and duration 
of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, effects of government support and customer 
assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent 
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of 
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated 
sensitivities described below.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm 
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse 
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the 
additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse 
scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in 
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison 
between these two scenarios reflects the following 
differences:
•An increase of approximately $700 million  for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments
•An increase of approximately $3.6 billion  for credit card 
loans
•An increase of approximately $2.1 billion  for wholesale 
loans and lending-related commitments
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
Fair value   
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for 
further information.

based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The 
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including 
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.
75
Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more 
significant than those required when estimating the fair 
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill 
impairment on page 154  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 
10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.
Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $8.0 billion  and $7.7 
billion  at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021
Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements
Reference Rate
Reform
Issued March
2020 and 
updated January 
2021•Provides optional expedients and exceptions to current 
accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedge 
accounting relationships, and other transactions are 
amended due to reference rate reform.
•Provides an election to account for certain contract 
amendments related to reference rate reform as 
modifications rather than extinguishments without the 
requirement to assess the significance of the 
amendments.  
•Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge 
accounting relationship without automatic termination 
of that relationship. Provides various practical 
expedients and elections designed to allow hedge 
accounting to continue uninterrupted during the 
transition period.  
•Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out 
of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria 
are met.
•The January 2021 update provides an election to 
account for derivatives modified to change the rate 
used for discounting, margining, or contract price 
alignment (collectively “discounting transition”) as 
modifications. •Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 
2021 update was effective when issued. 
•The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical 
expedients related to contract modifications and hedge 
accounting relationships, and discounting transition 
beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting 
transition election was applied retrospectively. The main 
purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the 
administrative burden of accounting for contracts 
impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did 
not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
77
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase  & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a 
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law 
in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the 
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in 
investment banking, financial services for consumers and 
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction 
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of  JPMorgan 
Chase  and its subsidiaries conform to  U.S. GAAP. 
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by 
regulatory authorities.  
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared 
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual 
results could be different from these estimates. In the 
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments 
have been included such that this interim financial 
information is fairly stated.
These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should 
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated 
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in  
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020 Form 10-K.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been 
reclassified to conform with the current presentation , 
including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the 
first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred 
investment tax credits from accounts payable and other 
liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying 
value of certain tax-oriented investments. The 
reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax 
expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with 
no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been 
revised to conform with the current presentation, including 
the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did 
not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed 
basis.Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which  the Firm has 
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  
the Firm are not assets of  JPMorgan Chase and are not 
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial 
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is 
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  
Refer to Notes  1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form  
10-K for a further description of  JPMorgan Chase’s 
accounting policies regarding consolidation.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables 
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the 
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net 
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceab le master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP 
also permits securities financing activities to be presented 
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including 
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting 
agreement.  The Firm has elected to net such balances when 
the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note  1 of 
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020 Form 10-K  for further information 
on offsetting assets and liabilities.
84
Note  2 – Fair value measurement  
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a 
discussion of the  Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, 
liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at 
fair value and the fair value hierarchy.
85
The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, by

(a)At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $96.3 billion  and $117.6 billion , respe ctively, which were mortgage-
related.
(b)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. 
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not 
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities 
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further 
87
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have 
been included in each period presented.
(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). 
(d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be 
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, 
private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $678 million  and $670 million , respectively. Included in these balances at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, were trading assets of $55 million  and $52 million , respectively, and other assets of $623 million  and $618 million , respectively.
(e)At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, included within loans were $20.1 billion  and $15.1 billion , respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, 
and $6.0 billion  and $6.3 billion , respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans 
originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $11.9 billion  and $8.4 billion , respectively.
(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid 
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit 
associated with cash collatera l.
(g)The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.
Level 3 valuations 
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
further information on the  Firm’s valuation process and a 
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for 
individual financial instruments.  
The following table presents the  Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the 
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for 
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of 
such inputs.  While the determination to classify an 
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the 
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, 
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable 
components (that is, components that are actively quoted 
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the 
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs 
are not included in the table. In addition, the  Firm manages 
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial 
instruments using securities and derivative positions that 
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The range of values presented in the table is representative 
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the 
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted 
averages of the input values presented in the table are 
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that 
the input is being used to value.  
In the  Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic 
average values do not reflect the degree of input 
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the  
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the 
characteristics of the various instruments held by  the Firm 
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range 
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation 
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied 
volatility levels because the option contracts have different 
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and 
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by the  Firm at each 
balance sheet date.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued 
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $397 million , nonagency securities of $32 million  and non-trading loans of $562 million .
(c)Comprises nonagency securities of $2 million , trading loans of $41 million  and non-trading loans of $473 million .
(d)Comprises trading loans of $791  million and non-trading loans of $788  million.
(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain 
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The 
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f)Includes equity securities of $ 9 6 8   m i l l i o n, including $ 2 8 0   m i l l i o n in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is 
generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant 
both individually and in aggregate.
(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-
based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100 .
(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i)Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K f or a 
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in 
unobservable inputs and the relationships between 
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of 
the underlying instruments and external market factors that 
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the  Firm’s 
positions.  
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the 
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in 
fair value) for financial instruments classified by  the Firm 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the  three 
months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . When a 
determination is made to classify a financial instrument 
within level 3, the determination is based on the 
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments 
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 
components, observable components (that is, components 
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external 
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table 
below include changes in fair value due in part to 
observable factors that are part of the valuation 
methodology. Also,  the Firm risk-manages the observable 
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities 
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 
risk management instruments are not included below, the 
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the 
effect of  the Firm’s risk management activities related to 
such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis 
Consolidated balance sheets changes
Level 3 assets at fair value, including assets measured at 
fair value on a nonrecurring basis, wer e 0.5%  of total  Firm 
assets at  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The following describes 
significant changes to level 3 assets since  December 31, 
2020, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring 
basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
on a nonrecurring basis on  page 94 for further information 
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis.  
Three  months ended March 31, 2021 
Level 3 assets were $17.4 billion  at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
reflecting  an increase of $952 million  from December 31, 
2020.
The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021 
was predominantly driven by  a $ 1 . 2   b i l l i o n increase in 
MSRs. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.
Refer to the sections below for additional information.
Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair 
value on a recurring basis 
For the three months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, there were no 
significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3 
into level 2.
For the three months ended March 31, 2020, significant 
transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:
•$ 2 . 1   b i l l i o n of total debt and equity instruments, 
predominantly trading loans, driven by a decrease in 
observability.
•$ 1 . 0   b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative receivables and 
$ 1 . 7   b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative payables as a result 
of a decrease in observability and an increase in the 
significance of unobservable inputs.
For the three months ended March 31, 2020, there were no 
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.    
All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/
or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to 
occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in 
which they occur.  Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total 
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods 
indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the  Firm’s 
risk management activities where the financial instruments 
are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value 
measurements rollforward tables on  pages 90–93  for 
further information on these instruments.  
Three months ended March 31, 2021
•$984 million  of net gains on asset s, driven by  MSRs 
reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. 
Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.
•$528 million  of net gains on liabilities, largely driven by 
market movements in long-term debt.
Three months ended March 31, 2020  
•$1.2 billion  of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net 
equity derivative receivables due to market movements 
largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting faster prepayment 
speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 14 for information on 
MSRs.
•$4.6 billion  of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven 
by market movements in long-term debt.

nonrecurring basis as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, $316 million  related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity 
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.
(b)Of the $303 million  in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, $137 million  related to residential real estate 
loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are 
valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with 
actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13%  to 45%  with a weighted average of 26% .

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or 
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in 
other income.  
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes,  the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed 
necessary to arrive at  the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different 
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with  the Firm’s valuation techniques for 
private equity direct investments.  
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of  March 
31, 2021 and 2020 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the 
periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair 
value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, 
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and 
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying 
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected 
life.  The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including 
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 
The majority of  the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as 
follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,  the Firm 
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without 
notice. Refer to  page 173  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related 
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option   
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, 
financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.  
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement 
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that 
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted 
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.  
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:  
•Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed 
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments  
•Certain securities financing agreements  
•Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise 
be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument  
•Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives  that are issued as part 
of client-driven activities  
•Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by  CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are 
carried at fair value  
Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the  three  months

(c)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected 
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for 
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors 
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. 
(d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if 
applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the contractual amount of  lending-related commitments  for which the fair value 
option was elected was  $20.9 billion  and $18.1 billion , respectively,  with a corresponding fair value  of $75 million  and $(39) 
million , respectively. Refer to Note  28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K, and Note  22 of this Form 10-Q for further

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients 
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk 
exposures. Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the  Firm’s use of and 
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.  
The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting 
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited 
number of  the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the 
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net 
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge 
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are 
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and 
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as 
derivatives used in  the Firm’s market-making businesses or 
for other purposes.
The following table outlines  the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure 
category.

While the notional amounts disclosed above give an 
indication of the volume of  the Firm’s derivatives activity, 
the notional amounts significantly exceed, in  the Firm’s 
view, the possible losses that could arise from such 
transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional

Derivatives netting  
The following tables present, as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, gross and net derivative receivables and 
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the 
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where  the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal 
opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, 
amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are 
shown separately in the tables below.  
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and 
payables,  the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate 
counterparty credit risk associated with  the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure 
amount . Liquid securities represent high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
•the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of 
the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and  
•collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not 
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features  
Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related 
contingent features related to the  Firm’s derivative contracts.  
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that 
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated 
collateral  the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of  JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries , predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered 
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be 
triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a 
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in 
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), 
nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the 
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset  
In certain instances  the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure 
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The 
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note  10, but in limited 
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers 
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS 
securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b)Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net 
interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate 
swaps and the related hedged items.
(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses 
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were 
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net 
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.  
(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward 
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis sprea ds. Excluded components may impact earnings either through 
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-
currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a)Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value  of $16.1 billion  and $11.5 billion  at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, to which 
the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus 
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income 
in future periods.
(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not 
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is 
$15.5 billion  and $14.5 billion , respectively, and for long-term debt is $6.4 billion  and $6.6 billion , respectively.
(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
(d)Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value 
hedging relationships.
(e)Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive 
(negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future 
periods.

Cash flow hedge gains and loss es
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and 
the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the  three months ended  March 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively.  
The Firm includes the gain s/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income 
as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of 
gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.  
The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the  three months ended  March 31, 2021 and 
2020 .
Over the next 12 months,  the Firm expects that approximately  $926 million  (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at  
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, 
the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately  
nine years , corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.  For open cash flow hedges , the 
maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately  seven years . The Firm’s longer-dated 
forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in 
principal transactions revenue.
(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains 
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making 
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the 
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain 
risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not 
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk 
management categories above are included in this 
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are 
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer 
to Note  5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables 
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the  Firm sold and purchased as of  
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary 
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of 
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic 
hedges, each of which reduces, in  the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. 
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. 
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual 
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt 
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b)Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years  or more, based on contractual maturity. The 
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years  for agency residential MBS, 4 years  for agency 
residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years  for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for 
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities 
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information 
regarding securities borrowed and securities lending 
agreements for which the fair value option has been 
elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding 
assets pledged and collateral received in securities 
financing agreements.
The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of  
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  
2021  and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. When  the Firm has obtained 
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master 
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,  the Firm 
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with 
the same counterparty. In addition,  the Firm exchanges 
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to 
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but 
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance 
sheet presentation. Where  the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty 
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with 
securities financing balances that do not meet all these 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in 
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the 
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net 
amounts” presented.  Where a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances 
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the Firm held $603 million  and $598 million , respectively,  of financial assets for 
which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. 
GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in 
trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.

Note  11 – Loans
Loan accounting fram ework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan.  The Firm accounts for loans based on the following 
categories:
•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
•Loans held-for-sale
•Loans at fair value
Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer 
to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. 
Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. 
Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into  three  portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the  Firm to determine 
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the  
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.  
Consumer, excluding 
credit cardCredit card Wholesale(c)(d)
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)• Credit card loans • Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)
(a)Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM,  and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and  Corporate .
(b)Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB for which the wholesale 
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d)The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, 
purpose, and type of borrower.
(e)Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to 
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for 
more information on SPEs.
The following tables summarize  the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the three months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . The Firm 
typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable 
requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.
(c)Excludes purchases of retained loans  of $7.0 billion  and $3.6 billion  for the three months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively, which are 
predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.
Gains and losses on sales of loans 
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related 
commitments (including adjustments to record loans and 
lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of 
cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the 
three months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 was $ 132 million, of 
which $ 1 3 5   m i l l i o n related to loans. Net losses on sales of 
loans and lending-related commitments for the three 
months ended March 31, 2020 was $ ( 9 1 3 )   m i l l i o n, of 
which $ ( 1 4 2 )   m i l l i o n related to loans.  In addition, the sale 
of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or 
changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for 
credit losses.Loan modifications
The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. 
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan 
modifications have not been considered TDRs because: 
•they represent short-term or other insignificant 
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan 
modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory 
guidance, or 
•the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the 
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided 
by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act.
To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of 
the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.  
As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not 
place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on 
nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise 
reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected 
losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all 
COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for 
credit losses. 
Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual 
status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would 
have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.
122
Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer l oans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking 
loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit 
market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans  
secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an 
interest-only payment period and certain payment-option 
loans that may result in negative amortization.

consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(b)At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still 
within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
(c)At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $36 
million  and $40 million , respectively, that are 30 or more day s past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(d)Includes loans purchased based on the year in which they were originated.
(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Approximately  35%  of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien 
position the  Firm holds is considered in the  Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to 
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because 
the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options 
available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm 
reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by 
the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately 7% 
of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days  or more past due.
(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered 
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the  fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of 
the underlying collateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.
(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $45 million  and $43 million  for the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , 
respectively.
(d)Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited 
COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-dependent and charged 
down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.
(e)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is 
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not 
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.
(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a 
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the 
extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all 
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h)Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(i)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
(j)At both M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $76 million . These amounts have been 
excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the  
Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are 
experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted 
for and reported as TDRs.  Loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs  nor are loans for which  the Firm 
has elected to apply  the option to suspend the application 
of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the 
CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was  
$251 million  and $142 million  for the  three months 
ended  March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively . There 
were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers 
whose residential real estate loans have been modified in 
TDRs.  
Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, 
generally provide various concessions to financially 
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest 
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays 
of principal and/or interest payments that would 
otherwise have been required under the terms of the 
original agreement.  
The following table provides information about how 
residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under 
the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above 
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 
7 loans where the sole concession granted is the 
discharge of debt , loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions, and loans for which  the Firm has elected to 
apply the option to suspend the application of accounting 
guidance  for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and 
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

modifications include more than one type of concession. 
Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent 
with those granted on permanent modifications.
(b)Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications 
and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR. Financial effects of modifica tions and redefaults
The following table provides information about the 
financial effects of the various concessions granted in

dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the 
end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For 
residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is 
deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments 
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will 
generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type 
of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the 
last twelve months  may no t be representative of ultimate redefault 
levels.
At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the weighted-average estimated 
remaining lives of residential real estate loans 
permanently modified in TDRs were  six years . The 
estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated 
prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., 
foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure
At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, the Firm 
had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured 
by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of  
$802 million  and $846 million , respectively, that were 
not included in REO, but were in the process of active or 
suspended foreclosure.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,  the Firm has 
temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This 
could delay recognition of foreclosed properties until the 
foreclosure moratoriums are lifted .

Certain other consumer loan modifications are 
considered to be TDRs as they provide various 
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial 
difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions are not 
TDRs.  
The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs,

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification 
programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers 
who are experiencing financial difficulty. The  Firm grants 
concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-
term programs. These modifications involve placing the 
customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for  60 months,  
and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit 
card. Substantially all modifications under the  Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with 
short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not 
considered concessions are not TDRs.  
If the cardholder does not comply with the modified 
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age 
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with  the 
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most  cases,  the Firm 
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit .Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial 
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans 
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. 
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is 
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses  two 
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified 
credit card loans remain in the modification program and 
continue to be charged off in accordance with the  Firm’s 
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients , to 
small businesses and high-net-worth individuals.  The 
primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating  assigned to each loan.  Refer to Note  12 
of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for further 
information on t hese risk ratings.

(a)Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management 
framework. As of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.
(b)When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically 
occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three  months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .
Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as 
they provide various concessions to borrowers who are 
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or 
other insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which  the Firm 
has elected to apply the option to suspend the application 
of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES 
Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act . 
The carrying value of TDRs was   $1.2 billion  and 
$ 9 5 4   m i l l i o n as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and December 31, 
2020, respectively.  The carrying value of new TDRs was   
$ 4 2 8   m i l l i o n  and $ 7 6   m i l l i o n for the three  months ended 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively.  The new TDRs for 
the three months ended March 31, 2021 were primarily 
from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that 
included extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan. The impact of these 
modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to  the 
Firm for the three  months ended M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 .

(a)Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-
collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been 
placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be 
modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.
(b)The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(c)At M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , lending-related commitments excluded $21.8 billion  and $8.0 billion , respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card 
portfolio segment; $674.4 billion  and $681.4 billion , respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $39.6 billion  and $24.0 billion , respectively, 
for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.
(d)Excludes the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $94 million  and $19 million  as of 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively. 
135
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
decreased when compared to  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
consisting of :
•a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the 
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential 
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued 
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser 
extent portfolio run-off, and
•a $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the 
LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroeconomic scenarios 
While the economy is showing signs of improvement, t he 
COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the 
Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not 
experienced in recent history, which has created additional 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and 
increased the reliance on management judgment. These 
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates 
remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 
2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range 
of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have 
been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately 
address these economic circumstances.
Further, despite the improvement in the economy,  
uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying 
labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, 
and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that 
could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a 
result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place 
significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in 
weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above 
eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six 
percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S.  GDP 
returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follow s: 
Assumptions at March 31, 2021
2Q21 4Q21 2Q22
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 5.7 %  4.8 %  4.3 %
Cumulative change in U.S. real 
GDP from 12/31/2019  0.2 %  2.7 %  4.3 %
Assumptions at December 31, 2020
2Q21 4Q21 2Q22
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 6.8 %  5.7 %  5.1 %
Cumulative change in U.S. real 
GDP from 12/31/2019  (1.9) %  0.6 %  2.0 %
(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates 
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future 
periods.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
As a result of  the Firm’s continuing involvement,  the Firm is 
considered to be the primary beneficiary of its  Firm-
sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase 
Issuance Trust. Refer to the table on  page 140  of this Note 
for further information on consolidated VIE assets and 
liabilities.  Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and 
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages 
and other consumer loans  primarily in its CCB and CIB 
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well 
as the respective business involved,  the Firm may act as the 
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial 
interests in the securitization trusts.
Refer to Note  14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for 
a detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with 
credit card securitizations and  Firm- sponsored mortgage 
and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting 
treatment relating to such trusts.

The following table presents the total unpaid principal 
amount of assets held in  Firm-sponsored private-label 
securitization entities, including those in which  the Firm has 
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by  
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the 
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests 
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit 
risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, 
and derivative contracts. In certain instances,  the Firm’s 
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The  Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and 
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

In the normal course of business,  JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.  The Firm held 
$10.9 billion  and $13.5 billion  of the commercial paper 
issued by  the Firm -administered multi-seller conduits at  
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively,  
which have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Firm’s 
investments reflect  the Firm’s funding needs and capacity 
and were not driven by market illiquidity.  Other than the 
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules,  the Firm is not obligated under any 
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and 
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been 
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related 
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were  
$14.2 billion  and $12.2 billion  at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively,  and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other 
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note  22 
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments.  
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are 
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB 
trusts. C ustomer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party, 
refer to  page 141  of this Note for further information.  
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB 
transactions.  
Refer to Note  14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for

(e)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, 
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the 
general credit of JPMorgan Chase . Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $4.7 billion  and $5.2 billion  at 
M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, respectively. 
(f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by 
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a 
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider , investor , 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee 
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the 
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying assets. Where  the Firm does not 
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a 
variable interest that could potentially be significant,  the 
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance 
sheets in the same manner it would record and report 
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.  
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm  holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit 
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities 
that own and operate affordable housing , energy, and other  
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A 
third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the 
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly  the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles.  The Firm generally invests in 
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the 
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by 
equity investments and funding commitments, was  $23.1 
billion  and $23.6 billion , of which  $8.5 billion  and $8.7 
billion  was unfunded at  March 31, 2021 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020, respectively.  The prior-period maximum loss 
exposure amount has been revised to conform with the 
current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to 
reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its 
capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits . 
Refer to Note  25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
further information on affordable housing tax credits  and 
Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments.  
140
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB 
trusts, including  remarketing agent, liquidity or tender 
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,  the 
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a 
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.  
In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,  
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders 
for any shortfall.  The Firm does not have any intent to 
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the 
underlying municipal bonds.  The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since  the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.  The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to 
customer TOB trusts at  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020  was $6.5 billion  and $6.7 billion , respectively. The 
fair value of assets held by such VIEs at  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, was $10.2 billion  and $10.5 
billion , respectively.  
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial 
mortgage.  Refer to Note  14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 
Form 10-K  for a further description of the  Firm’s accounting 
policies regarding securitizations.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored 
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to 
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization 
activity tables above,  the Firm, in the normal course of 
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans 
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, 
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs 
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the 
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans).  The Firm also sells loans 
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae 
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed 
by another U.S. government agency.  The Firm does not 
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these 
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a 
limited number of loan sales,  the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note  22 of this Form 10-Q  for 
additional information about  the Firm’s loan sales- and 
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for 
additional information about the impact o f the Firm ’s sal e

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to  the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain 
loans due to material breaches of representations and 
warranties as discussed in Note  22, the Firm also has the 
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for 
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government 
agencies under certain arrangements . The Firm typically 
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the 
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable 
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or 
guaranteed. When  the Firm’s  repurchase option becomes 
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding 
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.  
The following table presents loans  the Firm repurchased or

(b)Primarily foreign currency adjustments.Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter 
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or 
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business 
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.  Refer to 
Note  15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of  the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing, 
including the primary method used to estimate the fair 
value of  the reporting units and the assumptions used in the 
goodwill impairment test.   
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases 
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse 
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the 
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated 
fair values of the  Firm’s reporting units to decline in the 
future, which could result in a material impairment charge 
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill.  
As of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm reviewed current economic 
conditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic on business performance, estimated market cost 
of equity, as well as actual  business results and projections 
of business performance  for all its reporting units. The Firm 
has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting 
units was not impaired as of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, or 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, nor was goodwill written off due to 
impairment during the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  
2021  or 2020 .
143
Mortgage servicing right s
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value 
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally 
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing 
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage 
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Note s 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for a further description of the 
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.  
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the  three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .

advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right 
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if 
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements .

in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be 
linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular 
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without 
changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one 
factor may result in changes in another, which would either 
magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for 
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized requirements, for the 
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC 
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and 
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. 
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines 
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to 
maintain minimum ratios  for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, 
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR . Failure to meet 
these minimum requirements  could cause the Federal 
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to 
these capital requirements  established by their respective 
primary regulators.  
The following table presents the minimum and well-
capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries 
were subject as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020 .

supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0%  and 3.0%  for 
BHC and IDI  subsidiaries, respectively.

CECL regulatory capital transition delay
As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule 
that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to 
delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two 
years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning 
January 1, 2022 . 
The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 
2021, the capital metrics of  the Firm exclude $ 4 . 5   b i l l i o n, which is the $2.7 billion  day 1 impact to retained earnings 
and 25% of the $ 7 . 0   b i l l i o n increase in the allowance for 
credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances 
on PCD loans).   
The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have 
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, and total leverage exposure.  Refer to Note 27 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information 
on CECL capital transition provisions.
The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0,

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and other 
commitments
JPMorgan Chase  provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address 
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The 
contractual amount of these financial instruments 
represents the maximum possible credit risk to  the Firm 
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment 
or the Firm  be required to fulfill its obligation under the 
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most 
of these commitments and guarantees have historically 
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total 
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in  the 
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit 
exposure or funding requirements.  Refer to Note  28 of 
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for a further discussion 
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the  
Firm’s related accounting policies.  
To provide for expected  credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 
is maintained. Refer to Note  12 for further information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments .The following table summarizes the contractual amounts 
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments 
at M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The amounts 
in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain 
scored business banking lending-related commitments 
represent the total available credit for these products.  The 
Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all 
available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at 
the same time.  The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card 
and certain scored business banking lines of credit by 
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as 
permitted by law, without notice. In addition,  the Firm 
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is  60 
days  or more past due.  The Firm may reduce or close 
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of 
the underlying property, or when there has been a 
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the 
borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally 
consist of commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support 
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event 
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new 
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing 
organizations.  The Firm also issues commitments under 
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in 
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of 
credit.Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are 
conditional lending commitments issued by  the Firm to 
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a 
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial 
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, 
trade  financings  and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements  as of  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have 
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to 
Note  28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for further 
information on these derivatives.  
The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee,  the Firm is both a purchaser 
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives 
market. Refer to Note  4 for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives.  Merchant charge-backs   
Under the rules of payment networks,  the Firm, in its role as 
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for 
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that 
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is 
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will 
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the 
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the 
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable 
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services 
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the 
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by 
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve 
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant 
Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the 
payment or performance risk to  the Firm related to charge-
backs.  
154
Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with  the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with GSEs  the Firm has made 
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet 
certain requirements, and that may require  the Firm to 
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan 
purchaser if such representations and warranties are 
breached by  the Firm. 
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with 
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the  
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note  24 
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.  
Sponsored member repo program  
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the 
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing 
Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become 
sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The  Firm also 
guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and 
performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective 
obligations under the FICC’s rules. The  Firm minimizes its 
liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities 
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house 
therefore the  Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The  
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into 
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the 
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments 
line on  page 153 . Refer to Note  11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2020  Form 10-K  for additional information on credit risk 
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of 
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.  
Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt 
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan 
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100% -owned 
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and 
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees 
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity 
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 153  of 
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020  Form 
10-K for additional information.Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note  29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for 
a discussion of the  Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.  
Pledged assets 
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain 
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with 
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and 
FHLBs. Additionally, the  Firm pledges assets for other 
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other 
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to 
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits . Certain of 
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise 
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically 
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets 
pledged.

Collateral 
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is 
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This 
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other 
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related 
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative 
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and 
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales 
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of March 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and 
affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or 
respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including 
private, civil litigations and regulatory/government 
investigations. The litigations range from individual actions 
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with 
potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve 
both formal and informal proceedings, by both 
governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. 
These legal proceedings are at varying stages of 
adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each 
of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and 
a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and 
contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and 
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel 
legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.5 billion  at March 31, 2021. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
was based upon information available as of that date for 
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an 
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For 
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an 
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate 
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
involves significant judgment, given:
•the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
•the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability 
(if any) has yet to be determined, 
•the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
•the attendant uncertainty of the various potential 
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm 
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the 
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or 
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, 
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be 
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may 
vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal 
proceedings.
Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection 
with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore 
funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into 
residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali 
G r o u p  ( “ A m r a p a l i ” ) .   I n  2 0 1 7 ,  n u m e r o u s  c r e d i t o r s  f i l e d  c i v i l  
claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by 
home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to 
deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have 
been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 
pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In 
July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order 
making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other 
parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and 
the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, 
violated certain currency control and money laundering 
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry 
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) 
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 
2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional 
attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings 
freezing approximately $ 2 5   m i l l i o n held by JPMorgan India 
Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred 
to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A 
separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA 
violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and 
c o o p e r a t i n g  w i t h  t h e  i n v e s t i g a t i o n .       
Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the 
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major 
international oil companies. The account held 
approximately $1.1 billion  in connection with a dispute 
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the 
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid 
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in 
accordance with directions received from its clients. In 
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) 
commenced a claim in the English High Court for 
approximately $875 million  in payments made out of the 
accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the 
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a 
complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but 
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on 
notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was 
unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been 
scheduled to commence in February 2022.
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm 
previously reported settlements with certain government 
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and 
trading activities and controls related to those activities. 
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 
156
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In 
January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment 
entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in 
January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with 
the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the 
probation period. The Department of Labor granted the 
Firm a five-year  exemption of disqualification that allows 
the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the 
Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until 
January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course 
for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-
year  disqualification period. A South Africa Competition 
Commission matter is the remaining FX-related 
governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the 
South Africa Competition Tribunal.
In August 2018, the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York granted final approval to the 
Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by 
U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of 
federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to 
manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought 
damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures 
and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement 
class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the 
class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm 
and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A 
number of these actions remain pending. Further, a 
putative class action has been filed against the Firm and 
other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain 
consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly 
inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought 
against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on 
behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. 
In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 
11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $10 
million . In addition, some FX-related individual and putative 
class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct 
have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel 
and Australia.
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging 
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, 
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card 
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of 
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases 
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card 
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card 
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that 
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded 
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York for further proceedings consistent with the 
appellate decision.
The original class action was divided into two separate 
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other 
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the 
parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior 
settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the 
defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 
million  to the approximately $5.3 billion  previously held in 
escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, 
the amended agreement was approved by the District 
Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s 
approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on 
the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended 
class settlement, $700 million  has been returned to the 
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with 
the settlement agreement. The class action seeking 
primarily injunctive relief continues separately.
In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as 
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those 
actions remain pending.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 
various governmental agencies and entities around the 
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s 
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for 
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s 
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss 
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to 
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, 
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission 
issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding 
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to 
EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with 
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along 
with other banks in various individual and putative class 
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar 
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the 
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has 
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain 
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims 
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the 
defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative 
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was 
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District 
Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm,  
to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have 
appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual 
plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging 
that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an 
unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired 
to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans 
and credit cards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a 
motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin 
defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit 
defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that 
rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR.  Defendants opposed that motion, 
which remains pending. The Firm’s settlements of putative 
157
class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore 
Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, 
and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain 
subject to court approval.
Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and 
Related Inquiries.  The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions 
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, 
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective 
investigations relating to historical trading practices by 
former employees in the precious metals and U.S. 
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 
2016.
The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a 
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with 
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain 
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms 
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after 
three years , provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully 
comply with all of their obligations.  
Across the three  resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary 
amount of approximately $ 9 2 0   m i l l i o n. A portion of the 
total monetary amount includes victim compensation 
payments.
Several putative class action complaints have been filed in 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York against the Firm and certain former employees, 
alleging a precious metals futures and options price 
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity 
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust 
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the 
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court 
consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, 
and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In 
Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class 
action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying 
conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative 
class actions have been filed in the United States District 
Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern 
District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation 
of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims 
under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the 
complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the 
Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the 
Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these 
putative class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed 
their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021.
 Two putative class action complaints have also been filed 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York 
against the Firm and certain individual defendants on 
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the 
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the 
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not 
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these 
putative class actions in January 2021, and plaintiffs filed 
their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021. 
Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, 
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are 
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York.  The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust 
law and New York State common law in connection with an 
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous 
exchange trading for securities lending transactions. 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. 
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which 
defendants are opposing.
Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have 
been investigating a series of transactions entered into by 
senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) 
during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure 
their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 
Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a 
number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase 
cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges 
issued an ordonnance de renvoi  in November 2016, 
referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal 
correctionnel  for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 
2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling 
the mise en examen  of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court 
of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 
2018 that a mise en examen  is a prerequisite for an 
ordonnance de renvoi  and in January 2020 ordered the 
annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel . The 
Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power 
to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the 
Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the 
managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal 
correctionnel  directed the criminal authorities to clarify 
whether a further investigation should be opened against 
JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In 
April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear 
JPMorgan Chase’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of 
the tribunal correctionnel  at this stage of the proceedings. In 
addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil 
proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims 
are separate, involve different allegations and are at 
various stages of proceedings.
*     *     *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as 
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has 
158
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to 
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may 
be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with 
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm 
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its 
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its 
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $28 million  and 
$197 million  for the three months ended March 31, 2021 
and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the 
Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the 
future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome 
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek 
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters 
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of 
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot 
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of 
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or 
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase 
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial 
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the 
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no 
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently 
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among other 
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level 
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are 
determined based on the products and services provided, or 
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in 
which financial information is currently evaluated by the 
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented 
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and 
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of JPMorgan Chase ’s business segments.
Segment results
The following table  provides a summary of the Firm’s 
segment results as of or for the three months ended  March 
31, 2021 and 2020 , on a managed basis. The Firm’s 
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. 
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax 
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the 
Firm’s managed basis. 
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as 
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refer to Line of business equity on  page 98 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on 
capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the 
“Firm”) as of March 31, 2021, and the related consolidated 
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in 
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the three-month 
periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, including the 
related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim 
financial statements”).  Based on our reviews, we are not 
aware of any material modifications that should be made to 
the accompanying interim financial statements for them to 
be in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of 
the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year 
then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated 
February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing 
a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on 
certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial 
statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those 
consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the 
information set forth in the accompanying consolidated 
balance sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is 
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the 
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.  Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Firm’s management.  We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB.  We conducted our review in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB.  A review of interim financial 
information consists principally of applying analytical 
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the 
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements 
taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an 
opinion.

of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, 
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its 
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the 
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the 
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to 
the protection seller for the difference between the face 
value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of 
settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as 
to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by 
the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives

criteria
Embedded derivatives:  are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of 
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner 
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms 
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of 
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid 
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument 
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the 
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a 
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, 
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a 
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.  
ERISA:  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
EPS:  Earnings per share
Exchange-traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are 
executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing 
house.  
Expense categories:

correlate with changes in the related business/
transaction volume or revenue. Examples of volume- and 
revenue-related expenses include commissions and 
incentive compensation, depreciation expense related to 
operating lease assets, and brokerage expense related to 
equities trading transaction volume.
•Investments  include expenses associated with supporting 
medium- to longer-term strategic plans of the Firm.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio” : For residential real estate 
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between 
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of 
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.
Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination 
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual 
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the 
origination date.
Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current 
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated 
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home 
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area 
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist 
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data 
where actual data is not available. As a result, the 
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do 
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; 
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise 
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.
Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well 
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV 
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.
Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide 
financial results that includes reclassifications to present 
revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management 
also uses this financial measure at the segment level, 
because it believes this provides information to enable 
investors to understand the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the particular business segment 
and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with 
the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement:  A single agreement with a 
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed 
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and 
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the 
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a 
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral 
or margin when due).
Measurement alternative : Measures equity securities 
without readily determinable fair values at cost less 
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes 
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.  
Merchant Services:  offers merchants payment processing 
capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, 
and other payments services. Through Merchant Services, 
merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and 
debit cards and payments in multiple currencies.

Mortgage product types :
Alt-A  
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A 
lending characteristics may include one or more of the 
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; 
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) 
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial 
proportion of  the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a 
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his 
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.
Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the 
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only 
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option 
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the 
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually 
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed 
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once 
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and 
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The 
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is 
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. 
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan 
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date 
triggers.
165
Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related 
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage 
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have 
reliable payment histories.
Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or 
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a 
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the 
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) 
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all 
sources of funds.
NFA:  National Futures Association
NM: Not meaningful
Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is not 
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status 
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and 
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more 
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of 
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically 
maintained on nonaccrual status.Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain 
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real 
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.
NSFR:  Net Stable Funding Ratio

house, such that each derivative counterparty is only 
exposed to the default of that clearing house.
Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of 
total net revenue.
Parent Company:  JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: represents unvested share-based 
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, 
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share 
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase 
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees 
under its share-based compensation programs, which 
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the 
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested 
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under 
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and 
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock 
and participating securities, based on their respective rights 
to receive dividends.
PCD:  “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent 
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition 
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in 
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.
PD: Probability of default

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue 
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this 
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a 
lending institution to generate income in excess of its 
provision for credit losses.
166
Principal transactions revenue : Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer 
spread, which is the difference between the price at which  
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and 
the price at which  the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. 
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or 
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and 
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and 
losses on financial and other instruments (including those 
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in 
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity 
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities,  the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue 
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and 
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives 
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships 
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign 
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk 
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and 
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a 
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which 
include capital requirements for  credit risk, market risk, and 
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk.  Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally 
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced.

rates, commodities prices,  prepayment rates, underlying 
reference pool of loans or other market variables . The notes 
typically contain embedded (but not separable or 
detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for 
principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing 
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional 
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates 
or indexes.  
Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure 
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are 
currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss 
mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. 
Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, 
the total net revenue for each of the business segments and 
the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall 
fund performance:
Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services rank 
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over 
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and 
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. 
A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the 
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating 
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar 
rating” is derived from a weighted average of the 
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-
year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. 
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the 
individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is 
based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds 
with fewer than three years of history are not rated and 
170
hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned 
peer categories and the asset values used to derive this 
analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The 
data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. 
dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share 
class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share 
class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds 
except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund 
level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, 
denotes the share class recommended as being the best 
proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most 
retail version (based upon annual management charge, 
minimum investment, currency and other factors). The 
performance data could have been different if all funds/
accounts would have been included. Past performance is 
not indicative of future results.Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and 
five years):  All quartile rankings, the assigned peer 
categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis 
are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile 
rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each 
fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values 
into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund 
performance and associated peer rankings at the share 
class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share 
class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., 
Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for 
all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by 
Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as 
being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will 
be the most retail version (based upon annual management 
charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). 
Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more 
than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are 
included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to 
“Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). 
The performance data could have been different if all 
funds/accounts would have been included. Past 
performance is not indicative of future results.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 
Market Risk.
Refer to the Market Risk Management section of 
Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 135–142  
of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 10-K  for a discussion of 
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market 
risk.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an 
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with 
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial 
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, 
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls 
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of 
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, 
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all 
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls 
may occur from time to time, and there can be no 
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in 
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal 
control in the future and collateral consequences 
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal 
control over financial reporting” on page 158  of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2020  Form 10-K for further information. There was 
no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three 
months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, that has materially 
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.Part II – Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk
factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:
Risk Factors on pages 8-32  of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2020  Form 
10-K . The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, 
sets forth the material risk factors that could affect 
JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. 
Readers should not consider any descriptions of such 
factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could 
affect the Firm.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing 
significant harm to the global economy and could further 
negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses. 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization 
declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus 
disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 
pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led 
to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place 
requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other 
countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global 
economic conditions, including:
• significant disruption and volatility in the financial 
markets 
• significant disruption of global supply chains, and 
• closures of many businesses, leading to loss of 
revenues and increased unemployment.  
A prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the 
emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar 
effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global 
economy. 
The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic 
have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s 
businesses and results of operations, including:
• reduction in demand for certain products and services 
from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting 
in lower revenue, and
• increases in the allowance for credit losses.
Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with 
the determination of the allowance for credit losses have 
heightened performance risk in the economic environment 
precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even 
after adjustments have been made to model outputs, 
JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses 
arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from 
these developments. 
172
A prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the negative economic impacts of the pandemic could have 
other significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s 
businesses, results of operations and financial condition, 
including:
• recognition of credit losses and further increases in the 
allowance for credit losses, especially to the extent that 
businesses remain closed, unemployment continues at 
elevated levels, clients and customers draw on their 
lines of credit or significant numbers of people relocate 
from metropolitan areas
• material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives 
and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase 
owns or in which it makes markets
• downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings
• constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels 
of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) 
related to supporting client activities, downgrades in 
client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, 
any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to 
take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise 
would under its liquidity and capital management 
strategies, and
• the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan 
Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, 
including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-
place arrangements, government actions or other 
restrictions in connection with the pandemic.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively 
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations 
and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and 
liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are 
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the 
ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic, the 
effectiveness of vaccination programs and actions taken by 
governmental authorities and other third parties in 
response to the pandemic. Those negative effects, including 
the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed because of the impact of prior and potential future 
government stimulus actions or payment assistance 
provided to clients and customers. 
In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or 
indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or 
by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed 
to support individuals, households and businesses impacted 
by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase 
to:
• increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny
• negative publicity, and 
• increased exposure to litigation, 
any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s 
operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its 
reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic 
adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of 
operations and financial condition, it may also have the 
effect of heightening many of the other risks described in 
Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.

a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total  net repurchases and 
common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net 
income for the four preceding calendar quarters.  On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these restrictions through 
at least the second quarter of 2021. 
Shares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during the three months ended  M a r c h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1,
