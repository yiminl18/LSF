Firmwide overview 
For the third  quarter of 2022 , JPMorgan Chase reported net 
income of $9.7 billion, down 17%, earnings per share of 
$3.12, an ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 18%.
Total net revenue  was up 10%, and reflected:
•Net interest income of $17.5 billion, up 34%, driven by 
higher rates, partially offset by lower Markets net interest 
income . Net interest income excluding Markets was 
$16.9 billion, up 51% .
•Noninterest revenue was $15.2 billion, down 8%, driven 
by
–lower Investment Banking fees,
–$959 million of net investment securities losses in 
Corporate, and–lower net production revenue in Home Lending,
largely offset by
–higher CIB Markets revenue.
Noninterest expense  was $19.2 billion, up 12%, driven by 
higher structural expense  and continued investments in the 
business, including compensation, technology and 
marketing.
The provision for credit losses  was $1.5 billion, reflecting: 
•a net addition of $808 million to the allowance for credit 
losses, consisting of a net addition of $937 million in 
wholesale, driven by loan growth and lending-related 
commitment activity, as well as the impact of updates to 
the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by a 
net reduction of $143 million in consumer, driven by 
Home Lending, and
•$727 million of net charge-offs, up $203  million, 
predominantly driven by CCB .
5
The prior year provision was a net benefit of $1.5 billion, 
reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses 
of $2.1 billion and net charge-offs of $524 million. 
The t otal allowance for credit losses  was $20.8 billion at 
September 30, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.70%, compared 
with 1.86% in the prior year.
The Firm’s nonperforming assets  totaled $7.2 billion at 
September 30, 2022, a net decrease of $1.6 billion from 
the prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, ref lecting 
loan sales and improved credit performance in consumer, 
and paydowns in wholesale.
Firmwide average loans  of $1.1 trillion were up 7%, driven 
by higher loans across the lines of business.
Firmwide average deposits  of $2.4 trillion were up 3%, 
reflecting an increase in CCB driven by growth from  new 
and existing accounts across both consumer and small 
busines s customers, and  growth in time deposits in AWM,  
partially offset by  declines in both Payments and Securities 
Services in CIB and in non-operating deposits in CB.  Selected capital  and other metrics
The Firm’s CET1 capital  was $210 billion , and the 
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.5%  and 
13.0% , respectively.
The Firm’s SLR was 5.3% .
The Firm's TBVPS  was $69.90 , relatively flat versus the 
prior year.
As of September 30, 2022, the Firm had average eligible 
High Quality Liquid Assets  (“HQLA”) of approximately 
$716 billion and unencumbere d marketable securities  
with a fair value of approximately $771 billion , resulting in 
approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56  for additional 
information.
Refer to Consolidated Result of Operations and 
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 10-15  and 
pages 16-17 , respectively, for a further discussion of the 
Firm's results.

excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed 
basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20  for a fur ther 
discussion of each of these measures.

the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, 
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 89  and page 155 of

no assurance that actual results will be in line with the 
outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not 
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the fourth quarter of

backdrop of the global and U.S. economies,  financial 
markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the 
competitive environment, client and customer activity 
levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the

adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to 
ongoing developments in the business, economic, 
regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. 
Fourth quarter and full-year 2022
Management expects net interest income to be 
approximately $19 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, 
which would result in approximately $66 billion for full-year 
2022, market dependent .
Management expects net interest income excluding Markets 
to also be approximately $19 billion in the fourth quarter of 
2022, with Markets NII expected to be around zero, which 
would result in approximately $61.5 billion for full-year 
2022, market dependent .
Management expects full-year 2022 adjusted expense to be 
approximately $77 billion, which includes increased 
investments in technology, distribution  and marketing, and 
higher structural expense .

Business Developments 
War in Ukraine
The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine 
remain uncertain. The Firm has taken steps to close 
positions and reduce exposures connected with the war, 
and continues to assist clients with fulfilling or terminating 
pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related 
risks .
The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients 
and counterparties is not material to its financial condition 
or results of operations. However, the secondary impacts of 
the war in Ukraine, including increased market volatility, 
inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and 
economic sanctions imposed by various governments, could 
have adverse effects on the Firm’s businesses.
The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the 
operational risks associated with the war, including 
compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and 
the increased risk of cyber attacks.

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, “Russia” refers to exposure 
to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the 
largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest 
proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on 
the Firm’s internal country risk management framework; 
and “Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and 
counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic 
or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have 
been imposed or which have close association with Russia.Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition

make progress with respect to the transition from the use of 
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other 
IBORs to comply with the International Organization of 
Securities Commission's standards for transaction-based 
benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the 
principal tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, 
one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) 
is scheduled for June 30, 2023.
The Firm continues its client outreach with respect to U.S. 
dollar LIBOR-linked loans and continues to monitor and 
evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative 
developments. Refer to Business Developments on pages

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees  decreased in CIB, reflecting:
•lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile 
market conditions continued to have a negative impact on 
issuance activity, and
•lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced  
deals.
Refer to C IB segment re sults on pages 28-33  and Note 5 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions reve nue increased primarily in CIB, 
reflecting:
•higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, as elevated 
volatility drove a strong performance in the macro 
businesses, particularly Rates and Currencies & Emerging 
Markets, and
•higher revenue associated with Derivatives in Equity 
Markets.
Credit Ad justments & Other was a loss of $31 million , 
compared with a gain of $108 million in the prior year.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its 
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB results on pages 28-33 , and Note 5 for 
additional information. 
Lending - and deposit-related fees  decreased as a result of 
lower  cash management fees on higher credits earned by 
clients, in CB and CIB. Refer to CIB and CB segment results 
on pages 28-33 , pages 34-37  and Note 5 for additional 
information.Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue  decreased, reflecting:
•lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from 
lower average market lev els, largely offset by the 
removal of most money market fund fee waivers ,
•lower brokerage commissions largely in AWM reflecting 
reduced volumes, and
•lower administration fees in CIB o n reduced  assets under 
custod y reflecting lower market levels,
partially offset by
•higher travel-related commissions in CCB .
Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 
23-27 , pages 28-33  and pages 38-41  and Note 5 for 
additional information.

sales of  U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. 
Treasuries associated with  repositioning the investment 
securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO. R efer to Corporate 
segment results on pages 42-43  and Note 9 for additional 
information.
Mortgage fees and related income  decreased due to:
•lower production revenue from lower margins and 
volume,
partially offset by 
•higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain 
in MSR risk management, compared with a net loss in the 
prior year driven by  updates to model inputs.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27  and Notes 5 
and 14 for additional information.
10
Card income  increased, reflecting higher  revenue  on 
volume growth in commerc ial card and merchant 
processing in C IB and CB.
Card  income in CCB was relatively flat as the impact from 
the increase in debit and credit card sales volume was 
offset by higher amortization related to new account 
origination costs. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results 
on pages 23-27 , pages 28-33  and pages 34-37  and Note 5 
for additional information.

decline in volume, and
•net losses on equity investments in CIB, compared with a 
gain in the prior year ,
partially offset by
•the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, 
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar .
Refer to Note 4 for additional information on net 
investment hedges.
Net interest income  increased driven by higher rates , 
partially offset by lower Markets NII.

measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the 
Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20  
for a further discussion of Net yield excluding Markets.Year-to-date results

service fee volume  in CCB . Refer to CCB segment results on 
pages 23-27  and Note 5 for additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue  increased, predominantly driven by:

•higher asset managem ent fees, including in AWM due to 
the removal of most money market fund fee waivers and 
net inflows, largely offset by lower market levels and
•higher annuity sales in CCB,
partially offset by
•lower administration fees in CIB on reduced  assets under 
custody reflecting lower market levels.
Investment securities losses  reflected higher net losses on 
sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. 
Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment 
securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO.

Mortgage fees and related income  decreased due to:
•lower production revenue from lower margins and 
volume,
largely offset by

–a net gain in MSR risk management, compared with a 
net loss in the prior year driven by updates to model 
inputs, and
–higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-
party loans serviced. 
Card income  decreased due to higher amortization related 
to new account origination costs in Card, partially offset by 
higher  revenue on volume growth in commercial card and 
merchant processing in CIB and CB.
Other income  decreased reflecting: 
•lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a 
decline in volume ,
•net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM, 
compared with net gains in the prior year,
partially offset by
•proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first 
quarter of 2022 in Corporate ,
•higher net gains related to certain other Corporate 
investments, 
•a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial 
satisfaction of a loan in CB, and
•the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in 
the prior year on certain renewable energy investments 
in CIB .Net interest income  increased driven b y higher rates and 
balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII, 
as well as lower NII from PPP loans.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4 
trillion, up $203 billion, and the yield was 2.38%, up 56 
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an

Total provision for credit losses $ 1,537 $ (1,527) NM $ 4,101 $ (7,968) NM
Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, reflecting a 
net addition of $808 million to the allowance for credit 
losses and $727 million of net charge-offs. The net addition 
to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:
•$937 million in wholesale, driven by loan growth and 
lending-related commitment activity, as well as the 
impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic 
scenarios,
partially offset by
•a net reduction of $143 million in consumer,  driven by 
Home Lending .
The allowance for loan losses in Card was flat as the 
addition to the allowance resulting from higher outstanding 
balances was offset by a reduction related to a decrease in 
uncertainty associated with borrower behavi or as the 
effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
Net charge-offs increased $203 million,  predominantly 
driven by CCB.
The prior year included a $2.1 billion net red uction in the 
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $524 
million.
Refer to CC B segment results on pages 23-27 , CIB on pages 
28-33 , CB on pages 34-37 , AWM on pages 38-41 ,

and 12 for additional information on the credit portfolio 
and the allowance for credit losses.Year-to-date results
The provision for credit losses was $4.1 billion, reflecting a 
net addition of $2.1 billion to the allowance for credit 
losses and $2.0 billion of net charge-offs. The net addition 
to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:
•$1.9 billion in wholesale, driven by
–loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and
–updates  to the  Firm's macroeconomic forecast, 
including deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios 
and the increased weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022;
•$168 million in consumer,  primarily  driven by Card, 
reflecting higher outstanding balances, predominantly 
offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a 
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower 
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
Net charge-offs decreased  $349 million driven by Card, 
reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. 
However, median deposit balances continue to decline, 
impacted by the growth in consumer spending .
The prior year included a $10.3 billion net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $2.3 
billion.

million  and $289 million  for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively.
Quarterly results
Compensation expense  increased driven by higher 
structural expense and investments in the business, as well 
as higher revenue-related expense in CIB.
Noncompensation expense  increased as a result of:
•higher investments in the business , including marketing  
in CCB, and technology, and
•higher structural expense, including travel and 
entertainment and regulatory assessments, 
partially offset by
•lower volume-related expense, primarily depreciation 
expense in CCB on lower auto lease assets.Year-to-date results
Compensation expense  increased driven by higher 
structural expense and investments in the business, 
partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation in 
CIB.
Noncompensation expense  increased as a result of:
•higher investme nts in the business, including m arketing  
in CCB, and technology, and
•higher structural expense, including travel and 
entertainment, regulatory assessme nts, outside services  
and other employee-rel ated expense,

Effective tax rate  18.9 %  17.2 %  19.0 %  19.1 %
Quarterly results
The effective tax rate  increased and reflects the absence of 
an income tax benefit in the prior year related to the Firm's 
2020 U.S federal tax return, largely offset by benefits 
related to tax audit settlements and changes in the level 
and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, 
state and local taxes in the current year.Year-to-date results
The effective tax rate  was relatively flat compared to the 
nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, as benefits from 
tax audit settlements in the current year were offset by the 
absence of an income tax benefit in the prior year related to

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
decreased primarily as a result of lower deposits and loan 
growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placement of 
its excess cash with various central banks, including the 
Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements  increased  driven by Markets, reflecting:
•the impact of netting on client-driven market-making 
activities and collateral requirements, as well as
•higher demand for securities to cover short positions .
Securities  borrowed  decreased driven by Markets, 
reflecting lower client-driven activities, partially offset by 
higher demand for securities to cover short positions .
Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading assets  increased driven by: 
•higher derivat ive receivables , primarily foreign exchange

•The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, 
as well as  unrealized losses, which are recognized in 
accumulated other comprehensive income ( “AOCI ”), largely offset by net purchases
•The increase in HTM was also due to purchases, partially 
offset by paydowns.

•higher originations and revolver utilization in CB,
•higher balances in Card driven by growth in revolving 
balances on higher consumer spending and net new 
originations, and
•higher wholesale loans in CIB,
partially offset by
•lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as 
sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, 
and
•the impact from PPP loan forg iveness in CBB.
The allowance for loan losses  increased, reflecting a net 
addition of $1.8 billion to the allowance for loan losses, 
consisting of:
•$1.6 billion in wholesale , resulting from
–loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and
–updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast, 
including deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios 
and the increased weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and
•$204 million in consumer  driven by Card, reflecting 
higher outstanding balances, predominantly offset by a 
reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in 
uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the 
16
effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
There was also a $290 million addition to the allowance for 
lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
57-76 , and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable  increased 
predominantly due to higher client receivables related to 
client-driven activities in Markets, including prime 
brokerage.Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles  increased, reflecting: 
•higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates 
and net additions, partially offset by the realization of 
expected cash flows, and
•additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of 
Global Shares PLC and  Figg , Inc.  in the third quarter of 
2022, and Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Volkswagen 
Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.

Deposits  decreased reflecting:
•a reduction  in non-operating deposits in CB, and in AWM 
net outflows into investments as a result of the rising 
interest rate environment ,
partially offset by
•growth from new consumer and small business accounts 
in CCB that more than offset the decline in deposits in 
existing accounts as spending continued to grow , and
•an increase in Corporate driven by  the Firm's 
international consumer growth initiatives.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56  and 
Notes 2 and 15 for additional information. 
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements  increased due to :
•higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact 
of netting on client-driven market-making activities in 
Markets,
partially offset by
•lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO.  Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on 
pages 51-56  and Note 10 for additional information.
Short-term borrowings  decreased  as a result of lower 
financing requirements in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 51-56  for additional information. 
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities, which resulted in higher levels of short 
positions in debt instruments, as well as higher derivative 
payables as a result of market movements in Markets.  Refer 
to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.Accounts  payable and other liabilities increased 
predominantly due to higher client payables related to 
client-driven activities primarily in Markets, including prime 
brokerage.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs  increased 
driven by higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller 
conduit commercial paper issued to third parties. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56  and Notes 13 
and 22 for add itional information, specifically Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts .
Long-term debt  decreased  driven by:
•a decline in the fair value of structured notes in Markets, 
and fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury 
and CIO related to higher rates, 
largely offset by
•net issuances in Markets and Treasury and CIO . 
Refe r to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56  for 
additional information. 
Stockholders’ equity  decreased as a result of net 
unrealized losses in AOCI, which were predominantly driven 
by the impact of higher rates on the AFS portfolio and cash 
flow hedges in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Consolidated 
statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 93 ,

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 90-94 .
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
l e v e l .  T h e s e  n o n - G A A P  m e a s u r e s  i n c l u d e :
•Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 
overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” 
basis);•Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 
less total noninterest expense;
•Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue 
excluding Markets;
•TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;
•Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 
excluding Firmwide legal expense; and
•Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 
excluding trade finance and conduits.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.
The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20  for a 
definition of managed basis.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses 
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an 
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business 
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and 
analysts in assessing performance. 
Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the 
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and 
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. 
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest 
rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and 
liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the 
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process 
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other 
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest 
income to the segments.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and 
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues 
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks 
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate 
movements related to the transferred risk in its results.
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is 
referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and 
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refer to Line of business equity on  page 48 , and  page 93 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional 
information on capital allocation.
Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62  and Note 
32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of those methodologies.

Quarterly results 
Net income was $4.3 billion , relatively flat compared to the 
prior year.
Net revenue was $14.3 billion , an increase of 14% . 
Net interest income was $10.6 billion , up 26% , driven by:
•higher margins and growth in deposit s in CBB, and higher 
revolving loans in Card, 
partially offset by
•a reduction  associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB 
and lower NII in Home Lending  predominantly due to 
tighter loan spreads. 
Noninterest revenue was $3.8 billion , down 9%, driven by:
•lower production revenue from lower margins and volume 
in Home Lending, and
•lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 
in volume,
partially offset by
•higher net mortgage servicing revenue  due to a net gain in 
MSR risk management compared with a net loss in the prior 
year driven by updates to model inputs ,
•higher travel-related commissions,
•a gain on warrants associated with an equity investment, 
and
•card income was relatively flat as the impact from the 
increase in debit and credit card sales volume was offset by 
higher amortization related to new account origination 
costs.
Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in 
the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage 
fees and related income. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on card income. 
Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion , up 11% , reflecting:
•investments  in the business and increased structural 
expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, 
marketing and technology, 
 partially offset by
•lowe r volume- and revenue-related expenses driven by  
lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets .
The provision for credit losses was $529 million , reflecting:
•net charge-offs of $679 million , up $188 million, largely 
driven by  loan growth in Card,  
partially offset by
•a $150 million reserve release in Home Lending. 
The allowance for  loan losses in Card was flat as the addition 
to the allowance resulting from higher outstanding balances 
was offset by a reduction related to a decrease i n uncertainty 
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the 
pandemic gradually recede.
The prior year included a $950 million reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses across CC B.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
57-76  and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75  for a 
further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance 
for credit losses.Year-to-date results 
Net income was $10.3 billion , down 38% , predominantly 
driven by a net increase in the provision for credit losses 
compared with a net benefit in the prior year . 
Net revenue was $39.2 billion , an increase of 4%. 
Net interest income was $27.6 billion , up 13% , 
predominantly driven by:
•growth in  deposit s and higher margins in CBB,  and higher 
revolving loans in Card, 
partially offset by
•a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB, 
and lower NII in Home Lending driven by tighter loan 
spreads. 
Noninterest revenue was $11.6 billion , down 14% , driven by:
•lower production revenue from l ower margins and volume 
in Home Lending,
•lower card income reflecting higher amortization related to 
new account origination co sts, and 
•lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 
in volume,
partially offset by
•higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain in 
MSR risk management compared with a net loss in the prior 
year driven by updates to model inputs  and higher 
operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans 
serviced ,
•higher asset management, administration  and commissions 
revenu e predominantly driven by travel-related 
commissions and increased annuity sales, and
•higher deposit-related fees  due to higher service fee 
volume.
Noninterest expense was $23.5 billion , up 9%, reflecting:
•investments in the business and increased structural 
expenses, largely driven by compensation, marketing and 
technology, 
 partially offset by
•lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, largely 
driven by lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease 
assets, partially offset by higher o perating losses.
The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion , reflecting:
•net charge-offs of $1.8 billion , down $403 million, driven 
by Card, reflecting  the ongoing financial strength of U.S. 
consumers.  However, median deposit balances continue to 
decline,  impacted by the growth in consumer spending , and
•a $125 million net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses driven by Card,  reflecting higher outstanding 
balances, predominantly offset by a reduction related to a 
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior 
as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
The prior year included an $8.2 billion reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses across CCB.

this net impact, Payments revenue was $5.4 billion , up 
25% driven  by improved deposit margins and growth in  
fees on higher volumes.

1%. Markets revenue was $23.3 billion , up 5%.

driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by 
Derivatives.
•Securities Services revenue was $3.3 billion , up 2%, 
driven by improved deposit margins and growth in fees, 
largely offset by lower market levels and lower deposits.
•Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $773 million , 
reflect ing funding spread widening, and to a lesser extent 
losses on exposure relating to commodities and Russia 
and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a 
gain of $338 million  in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $20.7 billion , up 6%, 
predominantly driven by higher structural expense and 
investments  in the business , including higher compensation, 
as well as higher legal expense, partially offset by lower 
volume- and revenue-related expense primarily revenue-
related compensation.
The provision for credit losses was  $1.0 billion , 
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses, reflecting the impact of updates to the Firm's 
macroeconomic forecast and loan growth.

benefit of $1.0 billion , driven by a net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets 
revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K 
for further information.
For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $946 million , down 33% , reflecting a net 
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a 
net benefit in the prior year. 
Net revenue was $3.0 billion , up 21%  compared to the 
prior year. Net interest income was $2.2 billion , up 44% , 
driven by the impact of higher deposit margins and growth 
in loans,  predominantly offset by the impact of higher 
funding cos ts on loans and lower deposit s.
Noninterest revenue was $836 million , down 15% , driven 
by lower investment banking revenue  and deposit -related 
fees, partially offset by mark-ups on held-for-sale positions, 
primari ly unfunded commitments in the bridge financing 
portfolio. 
Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion , up 14% , largely 
driven by higher structural and volume- and revenue-
related expense , including compensation .
The provision for credit losses was $618 million , reflecting 
a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, largely

Net income was $2.8 billion , down 30% , reflecting a net 
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a 
net benefit in the prior year.
Net revenue was $8.1 billion , up 10%  compared to the 
prior year. Net interest income was $5.5 billion , up 22% , 
driven by the impact of higher deposit margins and growth 
in loans,  largely offset by the impact of higher funding costs 
on loans. 
Noninterest revenue was $2.6 billion , dow n 9%, driven by 
lower investment banking revenue and net markdown s on 
held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in 
the bridge financing portfolio, partially offset by a gain on 
an equity method investment received in partial satisfaction 
of a loan.
Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion , up 16% , 
predominantl y driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related and structural expense, including compensation. 
The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion , reflecting a 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, driven by 
growth in loans and lending-related commitments and the 
impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast, 
compared with a net benefit of $ 8 5 8  m i l l i o n in the prior 
year.

$916 million  in the prior year.
Net revenue was  a loss of  $302 million , compared with a 
loss of $1.3 billion  in the pri or year, driven by higher net 
interest income  due to higher rates, partially offset by lower 
noninterest revenue.
Nonin terest revenue  was a loss of $1.1 billion , compared 
with a loss of $242 million  in the prior year, predominantly 
driven by: 
•higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. 
GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, 
associated with  repositioning the investment securities  
portfolios, and
•the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on 
certain revenues, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar 
strengthening, 
partially offset by•the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, 
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, and
•lower net losses on certain legacy private equity 
investments.
Noninterest expense of $305 million  was up $145 million, 
predominantly driven by : 
•higher investments, including the costs associated with 
the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives , and

predominantly offset by the impact of movements in 
foreign exchange rates on certain expenses, primarily as 
a resul t of the U.S. dollar strengthening.
The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred 
42
to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was 
not material to net income.
The current period income tax benefit was predominantly 
driven by benefits related to tax audit settlements and the 
change in the level and mix of income and e xpenses subject 
to U.S. federal , state and local taxes that also impacted the 
Firm's tax reserves.

quarter of 2022, and
•higher net gains related to certain other Corporate 
investments .
Noninterest expense of $695 million  was down $856 
million, predominantly driven  by:

movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses 
primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening,  and 
lower technology expense, partially offset by higher 
compensation related expense,

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other                                                                                                                                                                                  
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm.  
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 
•Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 
•Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 
•Firmwide structures for risk governance. 
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 
Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 
Refer to pages 86-96  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-
K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
capital risk.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S.  Bank Holding Companies  
(“BHCs” ) and banks, including the Firm and its insured 
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries,  including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of 
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), 
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive 
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a 
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an 
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the 
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is 
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approac hes compared to their respective 
regulatory capital ratio requirements.  The Firm’s Basel III 
Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding 
than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios.  
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the  SLR. While the  Firm’s SLR is currently more 
binding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios, 
the Firm expects that in the fourth quarter of 2022, the 
Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios will become more 
binding due to increases in the Firm's risk-based regulatory 
capital requirements . As a result, the Firm announced the 
redemption of $5.43 billion of preferred stock and issued 
$3.5 billion of subordinated notes in the third quarter of 
2022 to rebalance the Firm's capital components . Refer to 
SLR on page 48  and capital actions on pages 48-49  for 
additional information.
Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition . On December 31, 2021, 
the CECL capital transition provisions ,	which delayed the 
effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired. 
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2 . 9  b i l l i o n CECL capital 
benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being 
phased out at 25%  per year over a three-year period.  As of 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, CET1 capital reflected the remaining 
$ 2 . 2  b i l l i o n benefit associated with the CECL capital 
transition provisions.Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased 
out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition 
provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier 
2 capital, adjusted average assets,  total leverage exposure 
and RWA , as applicable.  
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  and Note 
1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further 
information on CECL capital transition provisions and the 
CECL accounting guidance.
Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On 
January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach 
f o r  C o u n t e r p a r t y  C r e d i t  R i s k ”  ( “ S A - C C R ” ) ,  w h i c h  r e p l a c e d  
the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives 
counterparty exposure under the Standardized and 
Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not 
used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR 
in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the 
U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel 
III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the 
Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion 
based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 
31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 
bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease 
in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of 
SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser 
extent than Standardized .
Risk-based Capital Targets 
The Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 
capital ratio is 12.5% for the fourth quarter of 2022  and 
13.0% by the end of the first quarter o f 2023 . These 
targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in 
effect, tak ing into account the Firm's increasing  risk-based 
regulatory capital requirements .

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced 
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104  of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible  HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress.  Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible 
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of 
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that 
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded 
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.  The LCR for both 
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%.  
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, June 30, 2022 and S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  
2021  based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR 
framework.

securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(d)Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 
The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months 
ended September 30, 2022, compared with the three 
months ended June 30, 2022, predominantly due to long-
term debt issuances and  CIB Markets activities.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during 
the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared 
with the three months ended June 30, 2022 due to a 
decre ase in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA , primarily 
from a reduction in cash from a decline in deposits and loan 
growth.
JPMorgan Chase Ba nk, N.A.’s average LCR for the three 
months ended September 30, 2022 was lower than  the 
same period in the prior year du e to a decrease in 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N .A.’s HQLA as a result of a 
reduction in cash from loan growth, non-HQLA investment 
security purchases, a nd a decline in the market value of 
HQLA-eligible investment securities in Treasury and  CIO, 
partially offset by an increase in deposits.  Refer to Note  9 
for additional information on the Firm's investment 
securities portfolio.
The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR 
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity.
Refer to page 98  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and 
the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional 
information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, 
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. 
This includes exc ess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorga n 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately  $771 billion  and $914 billion  as of 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
respectively , although the amount of liquidity that could be 
raised at any particular tim e would be dependent on 
prevailing market conditions.  The fair value decreased 
compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 
decrease in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase  Bank, 
N.A., as noted above.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the  
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral 
pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $317 
billion  and $308 billion  as of  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, respectively. This borrowing capacity 
excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the 
Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that 
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and other central banks.  Although available, the 
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal 
Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks 
as a primary source of liquidity.
51
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires that the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of 
“available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their 
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year 
horizon.  
As of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR 
requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of 
the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose 
its quarterly average NSFR semi annually beginning in 
2023.
52
Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- 
and long-term cash requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term 
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from  the Intermediate 
Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries 
are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings 
and short-term secured borrowings  which are primarily 
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. 
Excess funding is invested by  Treasury and CIO  in the Firm’s 
investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other 
short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate 
and liquidity risk characteristics.  
Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-balance 
sheet obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.
The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of 
total liabilities, as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than period-
end deposit balances. However, during periods of market 
disruption those trends could be affected.Average deposits were higher  for the three months ended 
September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended 
September 30, 2021, reflecting:
•an increase in CCB driven by growth from  new and existing 
accounts across both consumer and small busines s 
customers, and  growth in time deposits in AWM,
partially offset by  
•declines in both Payments and Securities Services in CIB 
and in non-operating deposits in CB . 
Average deposits were higher  for the nine months ended 
September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended 
September 30, 2021, reflecting: 
•increases in CCB driven by growth from existing and new 
accounts across both consumer and small business 
customers, and 
•net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of 
certain government actions, 
partially offset by 
•a decline in Securities Services in CIB.
Period-end deposits have declined as a result of the 
migration that began in the second quarter of 2022. 
The decrease in period-end deposits reflects a reduction in 
non-operating deposits in CB, and in AWM net outflows into 
investments as a result of the rising interest rate 
environment,  partially offset by  growth from new  consumer 
and small business accounts in CCB that more than offset the 
53
decline in deposits in existing accounts as spending 
continued to grow .
The increase in deposits in Corporate was driven by  the 
Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.  Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance 
Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 
16-17  and pages 21-43 , respectively, for further 
information on deposit and liability balance trends.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.  
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 
at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, compared with D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  
2021 , due to  higher secured financing of trading assets and 
the impact of netting on client-driven market-making 
activities in Markets,  partially offset by  lower secured 
financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds.  The increase in 
commercial paper for the average three and nine months 
ended S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 compared to the prior year 
period, and the decrease in commercial paper at 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, was due to 
changes in the net issuance levels primarily for short-term 
liquidity management.
54
Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including  TLAC . Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.  
The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs.  The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding 
proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties.  The following table summarizes 
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine months ended  September 30, 2022 and 
2021 . Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104  and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021  Form 10-K for additional

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and 
credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional 
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on 
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and 
collateral agreements.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2,

Consumer , excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 driven by 
residential real estate loans at fair value and  auto and other 
loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real 
estate loans.
Residential real estate:  The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit.
Retained loans increased compared to D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
reflecting originations, net of paydowns.  Retained 
nonaccrual loans decreased from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
reflecting improved credit performance  and loan sales . Net 
recoveries were lower for the three and nine months ended  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 when compared to the same periods 
in the prior year driven  by lower prepayments in the curre nt 
year due to higher interest rates.  
Loans at fair value decreased from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, as 
warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced 
originations due to higher interest rate s and lower loan 
purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual  loans at fair value 
decreased from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 driv en by net portfolio 
activity in CIB . 
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstand ing was  $16.3 billion  at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2. This 
amount included $5.3 billion  of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $5.2 billion  of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030 . The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.
At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the 
carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans 
were $35.7 billion  and $30.0 billion , respectively. These 
loans have an interest-only payment period generally 
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing 
payment period to maturity and are typically originated as 
higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, 
predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential 
mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for the 
three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2. The 
credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the 
performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared 
with D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 predominantly due to PPP loan 
forgiveness in business banking and paydowns 
predominantly offset by loan originations in the scored auto 
portfolio . Net charge-offs increased for the three months 
ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 when  compared to the same 
period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and scored 
auto charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 increased when compared to the 
same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and 
scored auto charge-offs, partially offset by lower scored 
business banking charge-offs . The scored auto portfolio net 
charge-off rates were 0.27%  and 0.03%  for the three 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021, 
respectively, and 0.19%  and 0.01%  for the nine months 
ended  September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, as net 
charge-offs benefited from government stimulus and 
payment assistance programs in the prior year .

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
largely driven by growth in revolving balances on higher 
consumer spending and net new originations.  The 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 
1.23%  and 0.57% , respectively, increased compared to the 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 
1.04%  and 0.50%  but remain  below pre-pandemic levels . 
Net charge-offs increased for the three months ended 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 compared with the same period in the 
prior year  driven by loan growth. Net charge-offs decreased 
for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 compared 
with the same period in the prior year . Delinquency and net 
charge-off rates continue to benefit from the ongoing 
financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median 
deposit balances continue to decline, impacted by the growth 
in consumer spending . 
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.
Modifications of credit card loans
At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the Firm had $794 million  of 
credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in 
TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs, 
compared to $1.0 billion  at D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. Refer to 
Note 11 for additional information about loan modification 
programs to borrowers.
63
WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 66-69  for further information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated 
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto 
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.
In the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, credit 
continued to perform well with c harge-offs  remaining low . 
As of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the decrease in nonperforming 
exposure w as driven b y a decline in lending related 
commitments and loans, predominantly in CIB and AWM, as 
a result of net portfolio activity and upgrades, largely offset 
by downgrades including downgrades to certain Russia and 
Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022. Refer 
to Business Developments on page 9  and Country Risk on 
pages 82-83  for additional information.
As of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, retained loans increased $35.9 
billion  driven by CB and CIB, including increased revolver 
utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-
related commitments decreased $13.5 billion  driven by net 
portfolio activity in CIB, includin g a decrease in held-for-
sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio , partially 
offset by net portfolio activity in AWM.Wholesale credit portfolio

S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics 
equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when 
determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021  Form 10-K  for further

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the 
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, was $31.0 billion  and $38.2 billion  at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, representing approximately 2.7%  
and 3.5%  of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. C riticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and 
client-specific upgrades, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, including declines in Consumer & Retail, Real Estate and 
Technology, Media & Telecommunications . Of the $31.0 billion  of criticized exposure at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, approximately 
half was undrawn and $28.3 billion  was performing.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The 
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of 
JPMorgan Chase's 2021  Form 10-K  for additional information on industry concentrations.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.
The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  
2022  and 2021 . Since S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 1, nonaccrual 
loan exposure decreased  $596 million  driven by paydowns 
and client-specific upgrades in Real Estate, Individuals and 
Oil & Gas, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, 
including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-
associated clients in the first quarter of 2022.

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of 
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is 
generally held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and 
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives 
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to 
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions 
from its market-making activities, including the 
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. 
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its 
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature 
of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the 
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is 
exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the 
credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-
traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and 
cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the 
Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant 
central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). Where 
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures 
arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally 
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral 
agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative 
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding 
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically 
covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily 
— was approximately 88%  at both S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, 
and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. Refer to Note 4 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and 
for a further discussion of derivative contracts, 
counterparties and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $92.5 billion  and $57.1 
billion  at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
respectively.  The increase was  primarily driven by higher 
foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as 
a result of market movements. D erivative receivables 
represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after 
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting 
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the 
Firm. 
In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value 
of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these 
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent 
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in 
the LCR rule. 
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The 
benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each 
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master 
netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the 
derivative receivables for each counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative 
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains 
credit protection against certain loans in the retained 
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related 
notes. Information on credit portfolio management 
activities is provided in the table below.

 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and
•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 
was $20.8 billion , reflecting a net addition of  $ 2 . 1  b i l l i o n  
from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, consisting of: $1.9 billion  in 
wholesale and  $168 million  in consumer.
The net addition to the wholesale allowance resulted from: 
•loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and
•changes to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast reflecting
–updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios 
including an increasing forecasted unemployment rate 
and deterioration in the equity market indices, and
–the impact of the increased weight placed on the 
adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 
2022, due to the effects associated with higher 
inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical 
risks, including the war in Ukraine. 
The increase in the consumer allowance was driven by Card, 
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan losses 
resulting from higher outstanding balances predominantly 
offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty 
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the 
pandemic gradually recede.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.0% in the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.6% 
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2023.The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:  
Assumptions at September  30, 2022
4Q22 2Q23 4Q23
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 3.8 %  3.9 %  3.9 %
YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) — %  1.4 %  1.2 %
Assumptions at December 31, 2021

U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.2 %  4.0 %  3.9 %
YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 3.1 %  2.8 %  2.1 %
(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
(b)As of September 30, 2022, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP 
in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the 
percent change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. 
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates

 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists 
of high-quality securities. At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $616.5 billion , and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available, and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 42-43  and Note 9 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56  for 
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market 
Risk Management on pages 77-81  for further information 
on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial 
instruments representing ownership interests or other 
forms of junior capital . In general, principal investments 
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to 
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and 
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance 
sheets.  These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy.  The 
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and 
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial 
results.  The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in 
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to 
support underserved communities and minority-owned 
businesses.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 133-140  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities 
that give rise to market risk. 
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 149  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 
10-K.
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time.  Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”),  a statistical 
risk measure , to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment.  The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR .  
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a  
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events.  The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.
Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K 
for further information regarding VaR, including the 
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,  for 
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 138-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

(a)Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 
of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.
(b)In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was 
removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also 
removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.
(c)For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated 
average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR which remained elevated for the period ended June 30, 2022. For the three months ended September 30, 
2022, average and m aximum Credit Portfolio VaR decreased driven by a redu ction in nickel-related exposure  when compared to the three months ended 
June 30,  2022 .
(d)The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded .
(e)The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification 
benefit is not meaningful.
Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR was flat for the three months ended 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 when compared with June 30, 2022, 
reflecting increased market volatility impacting Fixed

predominantly driven by market volatility impacting Fixed 
income.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily  VaR model backtesting , which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect  the 
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of 
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income.  These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the 
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day.  The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. 
Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the 
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times 
every 100 trading days . The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number 
of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility 
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 261 days, and observed 25 
VaR backtesting exceptions due to market volatility that was materially higher than the levels realized in the historical data 
used for the VaR calculation. For the three months ended S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 33 of the 
66 days, and observed  seven VaR backtesting  exceptions predominantly driven by interest rate  volatility .
The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for  the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding 
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point 
intervals.  Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent.  The results in 
the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s  Basel III Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises 
not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s 
traditional banking activities, which include extension of 
loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and 
the investment securities portfolio.  Refer to the table on 
page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a 
summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions 
included in earnings-at-risk.
One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is 
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in 
the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts 
simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-
sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars 
and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These 
simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, 
deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt 
and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer 
pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other 
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a 
net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months 
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a 
parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-
term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve 
involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing 
long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving 
increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates 
constant or holding short-term rates constant and 
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many 
different factors, including:
•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment 
and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions 
about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients 
and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate 
changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on 
the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with 
underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, 
and other factors which are updated periodically based on 
historical experience. Deposit forecasts used in the 
baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions 
relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing.
•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, 
represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could 
change upon a given change in market interest rates. The 
deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual 
deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other 
factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate 
exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a 
forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook 
on page 8  for additional information).
The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table 
below.

reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher interest 
rates and higher corresponding modeled deposit betas, as 
well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.
As of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the Firm’s sensitivity to the 
+/-100 basis points  parallel and short-term shift in rates is 
primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities 
repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a 
+/-100 basis points  shift in long-term rates is primarily the 
result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to 
the impact of liabilities repricing.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the 
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant 
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2021  Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, as the movement in market 
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these 
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.
Refer to pages 141-142  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.
Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and 
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether 
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes 
activity with both government and private-sector entities in 
a country. 
Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is 
based on the country where the largest proportion of the 
assets of the  counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are 
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is 
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal 
residence) or country of incorporation. 
Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the 
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of 
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors 
attributed to that country. Activities which result in 
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not 
included in the country exposure measure (for example, 
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to 
collateral on securities financing receivables).
Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the 
measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an 
individual country. The use of different measurement 
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of 
reported country exposure.Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:
•Lending exposures are measured at the total committed 
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for 
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities 
collateral received
•Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with 
central banks, commercial banks, and other financial 
institutions
•Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
•Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value 
of all positions, including both long and short positions
•Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
•Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net 
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the 
same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair 
value of the derivative receivable or payable; reflecting 
the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures
The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the 
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory 
requirements. 
82
Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
their comparative exposures as of D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows.
The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in 
exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash 
placements with the central banks of those countries driven 
by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.
The decrease in exposure to Australia was largely driven by 
a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of 
Australia, due to client-driven market-making activities and 
lower client cash deposits following recent interest rate 
increases. 
As of September 30, 2022, exposure to Russia was 
approximately $600 million . This amount excludes certain 
client depo sits placed at depository institutions . Top 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.)(a)

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, 
human factors, or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business disruptions (including those caused by 
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), 
cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to 
comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure 
of vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates.  Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 143-149  of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management. Details on other 
select examples of operational risks are provided below.
In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions have 
been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and 
individuals by various governments around the world, 
including the authorities in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU. 
These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The 
Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated 
with interpreting and maintaining these complex 
compliance programs. To manage this increased risk, the 
Firm implemented additional controls reasonably designed 
to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent 
dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to 
sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as 
required by the applicable regulations. 
Business and technology resiliency risk
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s 
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, 
cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to 
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business 
disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event 
beyond its control that may impact critical business 
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, 
facilities and third parties). The program includes 
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of 
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical 
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business 
interruption and public safety risks.Cybersecurity Risk
The Firm continues to face increased risk of cyber attacks 
due to potential retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a 
result of the war in Ukraine. The Firm implemented 
additional precautionary measures and controls reasonably 
designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced 
threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the 
measures taken by the Firm to protect against cybersecurity 
breaches will provide absolute security against cyber 
attacks.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorgan Chase ’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),
•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and
•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2021 Form 10-K for further information on these 
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies 
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; 
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 73-75  and 
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across 
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily 
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific 
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled 
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.
•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices 
and HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment 
rate, averaging approximately 2.2% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
3.0% in the third quarter of 2023; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining 
approximately 4.2% lower at the end of the eight-quarter 
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 4.9% in 
the third quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a 
peak difference of approximately 13.6% in the second 
quarter of 2024.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:
•The allowance as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, reflects credit 
losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario 
due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.
•The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables. 
85
•Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition 
and borrower behavior can significantly affect the 
allowance for credit losses.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the 
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other 
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit 
losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the 
exposures below reflect the following differences:
•An increase of approximately $500 million  for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments
•An increase of approximately $2.5 billion  for credit card 
loans
•An increase of approximately $4.2 billion  for wholesale 
loans and lending-related commitments 
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2.Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for 
further information.

based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The 
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including 
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.
86
Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more 
significant than those required when estimating the fair 
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $11.1 billion  and $9.8 
billion  at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards 
points earned on accelerated spend and promotional offers 
outpacing redemptions throughout 2022 . Refer to page 
152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for a description 
of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated 
with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.
Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on pages 152-153 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with 
the accounting for income taxes.
Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on 
page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.
Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2.
Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-
looking statements. These statements can be identified by the 
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current 
facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as 
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” 
“goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-
looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current 
expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, 
results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this 
Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the 
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in 
its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In 
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-
looking statements orally to investors, analysts, 
representatives of the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to 
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm’s 
control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may differ 
materially from those set forth in its forward-looking 
statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks 
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in 
the forward-looking statements:
•Local, regional and global business, economic and political 
conditions and geopolitical events, including the war in 
Ukraine;
•Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements, 
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting the 
Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to address 
those requirements;
•Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and 
scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices, including 
dealings with retail customers;
•Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws;
•Changes in the level of inflation;
•Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;
•Securities and capital markets behavior, including changes 
in market liquidity and volatility;

savings behavior;
•Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its capital and 
liquidity;
•Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or its

•Damage to the Firm’s reputation;
•Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social, 
environmental and sustainability concerns that may arise, 
including from its business activities;
•Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an economic 
slowdown or other economic or market disruption, 
including, but not limited to, in the interest rate 
environment;•Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its 
counterparties or competitors;
•The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;
•Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue products and 
services, and the extent to which products or services 
previously sold by the Firm require the Firm to incur 
liabilities or absorb losses not contemplated at their 
initiation or origination; 
•Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products and 
services by the marketplace and the ability of the Firm to 
innovate and to increase market share;
•Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified and 
diverse employees;
•Ability of the Firm to control expenses;
•Competitive pressures;
•Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients, 
customers and counterparties;
•Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework, 
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control 
over financial reporting;
•Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;
•Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of certain 
assets and liabilities;
•Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or calamities, 
including health emergencies, the spread of infectious 
diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an outbreak or 
escalation of hostilities or other geopolitical instabilities, 
the effects of climate change or extraordinary events 
beyond the Firm's control, and the Firm’s ability to deal 
effectively with disruptions caused by the foregoing;
•Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its financial, 
accounting, technology, data processing and other 
operational systems and facilities;
•Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that may be 
caused by any failure of its operational systems or those of 
third parties;
•Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself against 
cyberattacks and other attempts by unauthorized parties to 
access information of the Firm or its customers or to 
disrupt the Firm’s systems; 
•Economic, financial, reputational and other impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic; and
•The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part I, Item 
1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K.
Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the 
Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and JPMorgan 
Chase does not undertake to update any forward-looking 
statements. The reader should, however, consult any further 
disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firm may make in 
any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly 
Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase  & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a 
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law 
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the 
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in 
investment banking, financial services for consumers and 
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction 
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of  JPMorgan 
Chase  and its subsidiaries conform to  U.S. GAAP. 
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by 
regulatory authorities.  
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared 
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual 
results could be different from these estimates. In the 
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments 
have been included such that this interim financial 
information is fairly stated.
These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should 
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated 
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in  
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021  Form 10-K.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been 
reclassified to conform with the current presentation.  Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which  the Firm has 
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
balances and transactions  have been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  
the Firm are not assets of  JPMorgan Chase and are not 
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial 
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is 
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  
Refer to Notes  1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 
10-K for a further description of  JPMorgan Chase’s 
accounting policies regarding consolidation.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables 
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the 
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net 
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP 
also permits securities financing activities to be presented 
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including 
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting 
agreement.  The Firm has elected to net such balances 
where it has determined that the specified conditions are 
met. Refer to Note  1 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021  Form 10-K  
for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.  
95
Note 2 – Fair value measurement
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a 
discussion of  the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, 
liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at 
fair value and the fair value hierarchy.
96
The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,

(a)At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $90.1 billion  and $73.9 billion , respectively, which were 
mortgage-related.
(b)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. 
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not 
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities 
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further 
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have 
been included in each period presented.

(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). 
(d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be 
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge 
funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $882 million  and $801 million , respectively. Included in these balances at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  
2022 , and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, were trading assets of $41 million  and $51 million , respectively, and other assets of $841 million  and $750 million , 
respectively.
(e)At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, included $11.4 billion  and $26.2 billion , respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $7.5 
billion  and $8.2 billion , respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with 
the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $3.4 billion  and $13.6 billion , respectively.
(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid 
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit 
associated with cash collatera l.
Level 3 valuations 
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for 
further information on the  Firm’s valuation process and a 
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for 
individual financial instruments.  
The following table presents the  Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the 
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for 
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of 
such inputs.  While the determination to classify an 
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the 
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, 
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable 
components (that is, components that are actively quoted 
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the 
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs 
are not included in the table. In addition, the  Firm manages 
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial 
instruments using securities and derivative positions that 
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The range of values presented in the table is representative 
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the 
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted 
averages of the input values presented in the table are 
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that 
the input is being used to value.  
In the  Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic 
average values do not reflect the degree of input 
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the  
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the 
characteristics of the various instruments held by  the Firm 
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range 
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation 
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied 
volatility levels because the option contracts have different 
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and 
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by the  Firm at each 
balance sheet date.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued 
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $776 million , nonagency securities of $9 million  and non-trading loans of $900 million .
(c)Comprises nonagency securities of $11 million , trading loans of $40 million  and non-trading loans of $362 million .
(d)Comprises trading loans of $825  million and non-trading loans of $312  million.
(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain 
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The 
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f)Includes equity securities of $807 million  including $227 million  in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is 
generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant 
both individually and in aggregate.
(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-
based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100 .
(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i)Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K f or a 
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in 
unobservable inputs and the relationships between 
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of 
the underlying instruments and external market factors that 
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the  Firm’s 
positions.  
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the 
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in 
fair value) for financial instruments classified by  the Firm 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the  three and 
nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 . When a 
determination is made to classify a financial instrument 
within level 3, the determination is based on the 
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair 
value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments 
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 
components, observable components (that is, components 
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external 
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table 
below include changes in fair value due in part to 
observable factors that are part of the valuation 
methodology. Also,  the Firm risk-manages the observable 
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities 
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 
risk management instruments are not included below, the 
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the 
effect of  the Firm’s risk management activities related to 
such level 3 instruments.

(a)Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions 
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.1 billion  in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, $1.0 billion  related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity 
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.
(b)Of the $927 million  in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, $65 million  related to residential real 
estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as 
they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s 
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 9% to 56%  with a weighted average of 23% .

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or 
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), 
with such changes recognized in other income.  
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes,  the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed 
necessary to arrive at  the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different 
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with  the Firm’s valuation techniques for 
private equity direct investments.  
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of  
September 30, 2022 and 2021 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded 
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the 
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, 
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and 
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying 
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected 
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including 
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 
The majority of  the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,  the Firm 
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without 
notice. Refer to  page 171  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K  for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related 
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm 
commitments, and written loan commitments.  
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement 
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that 
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted 
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.  
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:  
•Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed 
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments  
•Certain securities financing agreements  
•Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise 
be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument  
•Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded 
derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities  
•Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by  CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are 
carried at fair value  
Changes in fair value under the fair value option election  
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the  three and nine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 , for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss 
information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related 
risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(c)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected 
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for 
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors 
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. 
(d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if 
applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients 
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk 
exposures. Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the  Firm’s use of and 
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.  
The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting 
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited 
number of  the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the 
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net 
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge 
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are 
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and 
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as 
derivatives used in  the Firm’s market-making businesses or 
for other purposes.
The following table outlines  the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure 
category.

Derivatives netting  
The following tables present, as of  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, gross and net derivative receivables and 
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the 
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where  the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal 
opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, 
amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are 
shown separately in the tables below.  
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and 
payables,  the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate 
counterparty credit risk associated with  the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure 
amount . For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality 
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
•the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of 
the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and  
•collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not 
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features  
Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related 
contingent features related to the  Firm’s derivative contracts.  
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that 
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated 
collateral  the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of  JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries , predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered 
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be 
triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a 
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in 
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), 
nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the 
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset  
In certain instances  the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure 
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The 
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note  10, but in limited 
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers 
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), Secure d Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate 
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b)Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the 
inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item ; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 
Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses 
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were 
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net 
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. 
(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward 
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis sprea ds. Excluded components may impact earnings either through 
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-
currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.
(g)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus 
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income 
in future periods.
(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not 
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the carrying amount excluded for AFS 
securities is $15.2 billion  and $14.0 billion , respectively, and for long-term debt i s $208 million  and $9.7 billion , respectively. Prior-period amount has 
been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
(d)Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in 
future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net 
interest income in future periods.
(e)Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value 
hedging relationships.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed and SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of 
gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.  
The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the  three and nine months ended  September 
30, 2022 and 2021 .
Over the next 12 months,  the Firm expects that approximately  $(1.1) billion  (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been 
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is 
approximately  seven years , corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.  For open cash flow 
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately  six years . The Firm’s 
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

and related income.
(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated 
with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These 
derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate 
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is 
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making 
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in 
principal transactions revenue.
(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains

activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the 
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain 
risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not 
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk 
management categories above are included in this 
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are 
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer 
to Note  5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables 
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the  Firm sold and purchased as of  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary 
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of 
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic 
hedges, each of which reduces, in  the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. 
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. 
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual 
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt 
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b)Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years  or more, based on contractual maturity. The 
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately nine years  for agency residential MBS, and six years  for 
both agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and 
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are 
met,  the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the 
balances outstanding under its securities financing 
agreements with the same counterparty. In addition,  the 
Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its 
counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net 
Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where  the Firm 
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to 
the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, 
along with securities financing balances that do not meet all 
these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is 
presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on 
the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net 
amounts” presented.  Where a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances 
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In 
transactions where  the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives 
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral,  the Firm 
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other 
assets and the obligation to return those securities within 
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm held $295 million  and $440 million , respectively,  of financial 
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are 
recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan.  The Firm accounts for loans based on the following 
categories:
•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
•Loans held-for-sale
•Loans at fair value
Refer to Note  12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer 
to Note  3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on  the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. 
Refer to Note  2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.  
Loan portfolio 
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three  portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the  Firm to determine 
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the  
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.  
Consumer, excluding 
credit cardCredit card Wholesale(c)(d)
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)• Credit card loans • Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)
(a)Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.
(b)Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer loans for which the 
wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d)The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, 
purpose, and type of borrower.
(e)Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to 
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021  Form 10-K  for 
more information on SPEs.
The following tables summarize  the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

2021 . The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance 
with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.
(c)Excludes purchases of retained loans of $2.4 billion  and $7.3 billion  for the three months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 , respectively, and $11.6

related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the  three and n ine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 was $68 million  and $(246) million , respectively, of which  $ ( 4 8 )  m i l l i o n and

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, 
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. 
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by 
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only 
payment period and certain payment-option loans that may 
result in negative amortization.

follows: current included $27 million  and $ 3 5  m i l l i o n; 30–149 days past due included $11 million  for both periods; and 150 or more days past due 
included $15 million  and $20 million , respectively.
(b)At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still 
within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
(c)At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $26 
million  and $31 million , respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(d)Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately  37%  of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien 
position the  Firm holds is considered in the  Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to 
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the 
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available 
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

Total retained loans $ 237,771 $ 224,795 
(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm 
reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed 
by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, 
approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days  or more past due.
(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered 
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of 
the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $42 million  and $41 million  and $132 million  and $127 million  for the three and nine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 , respectively.
(d)Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(e)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is 
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not 
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a 
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the 
extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all 
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h)Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO 
band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.
(i)Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(j)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2.
(k)At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $53 million  and $66 million , 
respectively . These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.
141
Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the  Firm 
grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported 
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions are not

$116 million  for the  three months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  
2022  and 2021 , respectively, and $313 million  and $674 
million  for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
2021 , respectively.  There were no additional commitments 
to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans 
have been modified in TDRs.   Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, 
generally provide various concessions to financially 
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest 
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of 
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise 
have been required under the terms of the original 
agreement.  The following table provides information about 
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs 
under the  Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above 
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of 
debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions.

(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred 
within one year  of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such 
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments 
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. 
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months  may no t be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified 
in TDRs were  six years . The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and 
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).  
Active and suspended foreclosure
At S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S.

were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

million  and $ 3 5  m i l l i o n, respectively, were no longer accruing interest 
based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance 
of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified 
reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. 
There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90

(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In 
accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that 
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the 
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral 
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves 
subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be 
negative.
(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was 
not material for the three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,

(d)The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on 
the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,

Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to 
be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers 
who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-
term or other insignificant modifications that are not 
considered concessions are not TDRs.  
The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, 
were not material to the  Firm for the  three and nine months

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting 
concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty. The  Firm grants concessions for most of 
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These 
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed 
payment plan, generally for  60 months, and typically 
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. 
Substantially all modifications under the  Firm’s long-term 
programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term 
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs.  
If the cardholder does not comply with the modified 
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age 
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with  the 
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases,  the Firm 
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial 
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans 
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is 
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses  two 
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified 
credit card loans remain in the modification program and 
continue to be charged off in accordance with the  Firm’s 
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to small 
businesses and high-net-worth individuals.  The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating  
assigned to each loan. Refer to Note  12 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021  Form 10-K  for further information on these risk ratings .

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not 
TDRs.  New  TDRs were $108 million  and $180 million  for the three months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and 2021 , 
respectively and $587 million  and $832 million  for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 , respectively. New 
TDRs for the three months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021  reflected extending maturity dates primarily in the 
Commercial and Industrial loan class in 2022 as well as principal deferrals largely in the Other loan class in 2021. New TDRs 
for the nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021  reflected modifications that included extending maturity dates and 
covenant waivers for both periods as well as the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan in 2021 predominantly in 
the Commercial and Industrial loan class . The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to  the Firm 
for the  three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 .
The carrying value of TDRs was  $852 million  and $607 million  as of  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1,

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 
was $20.8 billion , reflecting a  net addition of  $ 2 . 1  b i l l i o n 
from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, consisting of: $1.9 billion  in 
wholesale and  $168 million  in consumer.
The net addition to the wholesale allowance resulted from : 
•loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and
•changes to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast reflecting
–updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios 
including an increasing  forecasted unemployment rate 
and deterioration in the equity market indices, and
–the impact of the increased weight placed on the 
adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 
2022, due to the effects associated with higher 
inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical 
risks, inc luding the war in Ukraine . 
The increase in the consumer allowance was driven by Card, 
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan losses 
resulting from higher outstanding balances  predominantly 
offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty 
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the 
pandemic gradually recede.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting i n a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.0% in  the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.6% 
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2023.The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:  
Assumptions at September  30, 2022
4Q22 2Q23 4Q23
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 3.8 %  3.9 %  3.9 %

U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.2 %  4.0 %  3.9 %
YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 3.1 %  2.8 %  2.1 %
(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
(b)As of September 30, 2022, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP 
in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the 
percent change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. 
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates 
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future 
periods.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
As a result of  the Firm’s continuing involvement,  the Firm is 
considered to be the primary beneficiary of its  Firm-
sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase 
Issuance Trust. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and 
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages 
and other consumer loans  primarily in its CCB and CIB 
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well 
as the respective business involved,  the Firm may act as the 
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial 
interests in the securitization trusts.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal 
amount of assets held in  Firm-sponsored private-label 
securitization entities, including those in which  the Firm has 
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by  
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the 
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests 
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, 
and derivative contracts. In certain instances,  the Firm’s 
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The  
Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and 
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government 
agency re-securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored 
private-label re-securitization VIEs.Multi-seller conduits
In the normal course of business,  JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.  The Firm held 
$12.5 billion  and $13.7 billion  of the commercial paper 
issued by  the Firm -administered multi-seller conduits at  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
respectively,  which have been eliminated in consolidation.  
The Firm’s investments reflect  the Firm’s funding needs and 
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.  Other 
than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules,  the Firm is not obligated under any 
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and 
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been 
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related 
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were  
$11.5 billion  and $13.4 billion  at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, respectively,  and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other 
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note  22 
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments.  
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are 
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB 
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.  
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB 
transactions.

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, 
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of 
JPMorgan Chase . Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $2.1 billion  and $2.6 billion  at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, 
and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, respectively. 
(f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by 
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a 
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider , investor , 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee 
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the 
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying assets. Where  the Firm does not 
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a 
variable interest that could potentially be significant,  the 
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance 
sheets in the same manner it would record and report 
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.  
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm  holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit 
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities 
that own and operate affordable housing , energy, and other  
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A 
third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the 
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly  the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles.  The Firm generally invests in 
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the 
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by 
equity investments and funding commitments, was  $27.6 
billion  and $26.8 billion , of which  $10.0 billion  and $9.4 
billion  was unfunded at  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, respectively.  The Firm assesses each 
project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying 
amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies 
for tax credits. Refer to Note  25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  
Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing 
tax credits  and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more 
information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments.  
157
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB 
trusts, including  remarketing agent, liquidity or tender 
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,  the 
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a 
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.  
In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,  
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders 
for any shortfall.  The Firm does not have any intent to 
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the 
underlying municipal bonds.  The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since  the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.  The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to 
customer TOB trusts at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 was $6.2 billion  and $6.8 billion , 
respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 was $8.2 
billion  and $10.5 billion , respectively. 
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mor tgages, credit card receivables,  
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.
Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to  the Firm’s securitization activities for the  three and nine months ended  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 , related to assets held in Firm -sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by  
the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored 
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to 
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization 
activity tables above,  the Firm, in the normal course of 
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans 
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, 
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs 
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the 
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans).  The Firm also sells loans 
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae 
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed 
by another U.S. government agency.  The Firm does not 
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these 
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a 
limited number of loan sales,  the Firm is obligated to share 
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note  22 of this Form 10-Q for 
additional information about  the Firm’s loan sales- and 
securitization-related indemnifications and Note  14 for 
additional information about the impact of  the Firm ’s sale 
of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to  the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain 
loans due to material breaches of representations and 
warranties as discussed in Note  22, the Firm also has the 
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for 
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements . The Firm typically 
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan 
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the 
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable 
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or 
guaranteed. When  the Firm’s  repurchase option becomes 
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding 
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.  
The following table presents loans  the Firm repurchased or 
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and 
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage 
loans recognized on  the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets 
as of  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.

of Nutmeg in Corporate, OpenInvest and Campbell Global in AWM and 
Frank in CCB.
(b)Primarily foreign currency adjustments and, in 2021, adjustments to 
goodwill related to prior period acquisitions.Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter 
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or 
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business 
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.  Refer to 
Note  15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of  the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases 
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse 
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the 
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated 
fair values of the  Firm’s reporting units to decline in the 
future, which could result in a material impairment charge 
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill.  
As of  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, the Firm reviewed current 
economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as 
well as actual business results and projections of business 
performance . Based on such reviews, the Firm has 
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of 
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, or D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, nor was 
goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 or 2021 .
160
Mortgage servicing right s
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value 
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally 
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing 
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage 
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Note s 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021  Form 10-K  for a further description of the 
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.  
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the  three and nine months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 .

short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer 
advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right 
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if 
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements .

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the 
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change 
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be 
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a

Note 21 – Regulatory capit al 
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for 
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized requirements, for the 
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC 
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and 
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. 
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines 
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to 
maintain minimum ratios  for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, 
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR . Failure to meet 
these minimum requirements  could cause the Federal 
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to 
these capital requirements  established by their respective 
primary regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based  regulatory 
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to 
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of  
S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.

CECL regulatory capital transition
On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition 
provisions ,	which delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory 
capital for two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022, 
the $ 2 . 9  b i l l i o n CECL capital benefit recognized as of 
December 31, 2021, is being phased out at 25%  per year 
over a three-year period.  As of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, CET1 
capital reflected the remaining $ 2 . 2  b i l l i o n benefit 
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.
Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased 
out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition 
provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier 
2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure 
and RWA, as applicable.  
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and other 
commitments
JPMorgan Chase  provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address 
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The 
contractual amount of these financial instruments 
represents the maximum possible credit risk to  the Firm 
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment 
or the Firm  be required to fulfill its obligation under the 
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most 
of these commitments and guarantees have historically 
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total 
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in  the 
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit 
exposure or funding requirements.  Refer to Note  28 of 
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021  Form 10-K  for a further discussion 
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the  
Firm’s related accounting policies.  
To provide for expected  credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 
is maintained. Refer to Note  12 for further information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments .The following table summarizes the contractual amounts 
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments 
at S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The 
amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and 
certain scored business banking lending-related 
commitments represent the total available credit for these 
products.  The Firm has not experienced, and does not 
anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these 
products will be utilized at the same time.  The Firm can 
reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business 
banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, 
in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In 
addition,  the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the 
borrower is  60 days  or more past due.  The Firm may reduce 
or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the 
value of the underlying property, or when there has been a 
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the 
borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally 
consist of commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support 
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event 
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new 
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing 
organizations.  The Firm also issues commitments under 
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in 
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of 
credit.Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are 
conditional lending commitments issued by  the Firm to 
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a 
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial 
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, 
trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee,  the Firm is both a purchaser 
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives 
market. Refer to Note  4 for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives.  Merchant charge-backs  
Under the rules of payment networks,  the Firm, in its role as 
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for 
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that 
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is 
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will 
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the 
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the 
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable 
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services 
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the 
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by 
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve 
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant 
Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the 
payment or performance risk to  the Firm related to charge-
backs.  
173
Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with  the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with GSEs  the Firm has made 
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet 
certain requirements, and that may require  the Firm to 
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan 
purchaser if such representations and warranties are 
breached by  the Firm. 
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with 
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the  
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note  24 
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.  
Sponsored member repo program  
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight an d term resale and repurchase agreements 
through the Government Se curities Division of the Fixed 
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients 
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. 
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full 
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ 
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The  Firm 
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities 
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house 
therefore the  Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The  
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into 
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the 
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments 
line on  page 172 . Refer to Note  11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2021  Form 10-K  for additional information on credit risk 
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of 
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.  
Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt 
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan 
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100% -owned 
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and 
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees 
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity 
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 172  of 
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021  Form 
10-K for additional information.Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Note 24 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of September 30, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries 
and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous 
legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, 
government investigations or regulatory enforcement 
matters. The litigations range from individual actions 
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with 
potentially millions of class members. Investigations and 
regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and 
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and 
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are 
at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or 
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of 
business and several geographies and a wide variety of 
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and 
statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection 
claims), some of which present novel legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.2 billion  at September 30, 2022. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
was based upon information available as of that date for 
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an 
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For 
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an 
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate 
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
involves significant judgment, given:
•the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
•the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability 
(if any) has yet to be determined, 
•the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
•the attendant uncertainty of the various potential 
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm 
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the 
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or 
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, 
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be 
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may 
vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal 
proceedings.
1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a 
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia 
by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian 
state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan 
(Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges 
“dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in 
relation to payments of $ 3 0 0  m i l l i o n and $ 5 0 0  m i l l i o n, 
from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB 
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 
1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company 
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited.  
In September 2022, the Firm filed an application 
challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court’s 
jurisdiction to hear the claim.
Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in 
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by 
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase 
entities into residential housing projects developed by the 
A m r a p a l i  G r o u p  ( “ A m r a p a l i ” ) .  I n  2 0 1 7 ,  n u m e r o u s  c r e d i t o r s  
filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions 
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or 
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ 
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India 
and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order 
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately 
$31.5 million . The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. 
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued 
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and 
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities 
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, 
violated certain currency control and money laundering 
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry 
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) 
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million  from J.P. 
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the 
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and 
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.   
Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the 
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major 
international oil companies. The account held 
approximately $1.1 billion  in connection with a dispute 
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the 
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid 
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in 
accordance with directions received from its clients. In 
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) 
commenced a claim in the English High Court for 
approximately $875 million  in payments made out of the 
accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were 
175
instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments 
may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and 
April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in 
favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. 
The FRN has requested permission to appeal the decision 
relating solely to the 2013 payment of approximately 
$ 7 5  m i l l i o n.
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm 
previously reported settlements with certain government 
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and 
trading activities and controls related to those activities. 
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The 
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm a five-year  
exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its 
affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional 
Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm 
will need the DOL to approve a further exemption to cover 
the remainder of the ten-year  disqualification period 
following the antitrust plea. In October 2022, the DOL 
published a proposed exemption for the remainder of the 
disqualification period. This proposal will be open for public 
comment until December 2022. The only remaining FX-
related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition 
Commission matter which is currently pending before the 
South Africa Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a 
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, 
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws 
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign 
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of 
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on 
futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed 
requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and 
certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other 
foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of 
these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class 
action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign 
exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who 
purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. 
Another putative class action was brought against the Firm 
and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported 
indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court 
approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants 
of that class action for a total of $10 million . In addition, 
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based 
on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed 
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the 
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action 
pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, 
proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's 
denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached 
in the putative class action, which remains subject to court 
approval.   
Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . In 
December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered 
into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective 
civil investigations of compliance with records preservation 
requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap 
dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and 
CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain 
copies of certain communications required to be maintained 
under their respective record keeping rules, where such 
communications were sent or received by employees over 
electronic messaging channels that had not been approved 
for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also 
included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan 
Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found 
related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 1 2 5  m i l l i o n civil monetary 
penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc 
paid a total $ 7 5  m i l l i o n civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. 
The Firm continues to respond to requests for information 
and other material from certain authorities concerning its 
compliance with records preservation requirements in 
connection with business communications sent over 
electronic messaging channels that have not been approved 
by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.
In March 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York against the Firm’s Board of Directors asserting 
breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities 
laws based on the Board’s alleged failure to exercise 
adequate oversight over compliance with records 
preservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages, 
restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance 
reforms. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint in August 
2022, which defendants have moved to dismiss.
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging 
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, 
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card 
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of 
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases 
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card 
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card 
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that 
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded 
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York for further proceedings consistent with the 
appellate decision.
The original class action was divided into two separate 
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other 
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the 
176
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement 
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement 
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants 
collectively contributed an additional $900 million  to the 
approximately $5.3 billion  previously held in escrow from 
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended 
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. 
Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval 
order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the 
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended 
class settlement, $700 million  has been returned to the 
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with 
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action 
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District 
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in 
part, and denied the motion in part.
In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as 
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those 
actions remain pending.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 
various governmental agencies and entities around the 
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s 
(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for 
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s 
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss 
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to 
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain 
subject, continues. In December 2016, the European 
Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other 
banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules 
relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that 
decision with the European General Court, and that appeal 
is pending.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along 
with other banks in various individual and putative class 
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar 
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the 
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has 
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain 
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims 
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the 
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative 
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was 
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been 
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a 
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and 
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement 
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the 
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. 
Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In 
December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a 
preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from 
setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. In September 
2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its 
entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
asserting similar antitrust claims in October 2022. The 
Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss 
franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the 
Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill 
Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.
Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and 
Related Inquiries.  The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions 
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, 
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective 
investigations relating to historical trading practices by 
former employees in the precious metals and U.S. 
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 
2016.
The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a 
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with 
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain 
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms 
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after 
three years , provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully 
comply with all of their obligations. 
Across the three  resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary 
amount of approximately $ 9 2 0  m i l l i o n. A portion of the 
total monetary amount includes victim compensation 
payments.
Several putative class action complaints have been filed in 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York against the Firm and certain former employees, 
alleging a precious metals futures and options price 
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity 
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust 
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the 
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court 
consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July 2022, 
the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the 
parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed 
in the United States District Courts for the Northern District 
of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the 
Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and 
options, and bringing claims under the Commodity 
Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois 
were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The 
Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June 
2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement 
among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced 
177
putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged 
underlying conduct related to precious metals.
In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were 
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New 
York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on 
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the 
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the 
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not 
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these 
putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their 
second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally 
alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures 
contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during 
the putative class period were materially false and 
misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.  
In May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit purporting to act 
on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the 
State of New York asserting breach of fiduciary duty and 
unjust enrichment claims against certain current and 
former officers and directors of the Firm. The complaint 
claims the Firm’s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the 
shareholder’s demand to commence litigation and seeks 
damages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms 
on the basis of alleged supervisory failures with regard to 
certain historical spoofing-related conduct that was the 
subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC 
in September 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities 
that were separately the subject of a resolution between 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. 
Defendants have moved to dismiss.
Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, 
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are 
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust 
law and New York State common law in connection with an 
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous 
exchange trading for securities lending transactions. 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. 
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which 
defendants are opposing.
*     *     *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as 
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has 
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to 
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may 
be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm 
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its 
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its 
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $47 million  and $76 
million  for the three months ended September 30, 2022 
and 2021 , respectively, and $239 million  and $289 million  
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , 
respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation 
reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome 
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek 
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters 
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of 
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot 
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of 
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or 
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase 
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial 
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the 
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no 
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently 
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among other 
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level 
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are 
determined based on the products and services provided, or 
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in 
which financial information is currently evaluated by the 
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented 
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and 
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of JPMorgan Chase ’s business segments.
Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
segment results as of or for the three and nine months 
ended  September 30, 2022 and 2021 , on a managed basis. 
The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the 
reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE 
basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the 
Firm’s managed basis. 
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is 
referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and 
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. 
Refer to Line of business equity on  page 93 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on 
capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the 
“Firm”) as of S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income 
and changes in stockholders’ equity for the three-month 
and nine-month periods ended S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 
2021  and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the 
nine-month periods ended S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 and 2021 , 
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
“interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we 
are not aware of any material modifications that should be 
made to the accompanying interim financial statements for 
them to be in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of 
the Firm as of D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the 
year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report 
dated February 22, 2022, which included a paragraph 
describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit 
losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we 
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated 
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set 
forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
information as of D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, is fairly stated, in all 
material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance 
sheet from which it has been derived.  Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial 
information consists principally of applying analytical 
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the 
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements 
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an 
opinion.

another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence 
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, 
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its 
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the 
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the 
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to 
the protection seller for the difference between the face

criteria
Embedded derivatives:  are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of 
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner 
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms 
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of 
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid 
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument 
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the 
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a 
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, 
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a 
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio” : For residential real estate 
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between 
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of 
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.
Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination 
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual 
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the 
origination date.
Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current 
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated 
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home 
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area 
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist 
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data 
where actual data is not available. As a result, the 
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do 
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; 
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise 
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.
Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well 
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV 
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Mortgage product types :
Alt-A  
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A 
lending characteristics may include one or more of the 
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; 
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) 
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial 
proportion of  the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a 
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his 
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.
Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the 
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only 
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option 
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the 
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually 
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed 
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once 
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and 
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The 
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is 
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. 
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan 
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date 
triggers.
Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related 
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage 
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have 
reliable payment histories.
186
Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or 
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a 
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the 
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) 
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.
MREL : Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible 
liabilities

earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.  
Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for 
interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all 
sources of funds.
NFA:  National Futures Association
NM: Not meaningful
Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is not 
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status 
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and 
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more 
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of 
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically 
maintained on nonaccrual status.
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain 
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real 
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

total net revenue.
Parent Company:  JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: represents unvested share-based 
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, 
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share 
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase 
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees 
under its share-based compensation programs, which 
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the 
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested 
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under 
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and 
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock 
and participating securities, based on their respective rights 
to receive dividends.
PCD:  “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent 
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition 
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in 
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.
Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” 
approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital 
requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and 
prescribes rules for calculating RWA.
Pillar 3:  The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” 
approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through 
disclosure requirements which allow market participants to 
assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.
PPP:  Paycheck Protection Program under the Small 
Business Association (“SBA”)
PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority
Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue 
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this 
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a 
lending institution to generate income in excess of its 
provision for credit losses.
Principal transactions revenue : Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer 
spread, which is the difference between the price at which  
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and 
the price at which  the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. 
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or 
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and 
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and 
187
losses on financial and other instruments (including those 
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in 
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity 
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities,  the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue 
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and 
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives 
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships 
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign 
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk 
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and 
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a 
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which 
include capital requirements for  credit risk, market risk, and 
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk.  Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive 
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally 
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced.

reference pool of loans or other market variables. The notes 
typically contain embedded (but not separable or 
detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for 
principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing 
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional 
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates 
or indexes.  
Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure 
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are 
currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss 
mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. 
Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results,

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall 
fund performance:
Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services rank 
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over 
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and 
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the 
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating 
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is 
derived from a weighted average of the performance 
associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled 
funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual 
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on 
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with 
fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence 
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer 
191
categories and the asset values used to derive these 
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers 
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage 
of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for 
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for 
Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. 
The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not 
indicative of future results.
Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and 
five years):  All quartile rankings, the assigned peer 
categories and the asset values used to derive these 
rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. 
Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute 
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating 
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The 
percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and 
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and 
Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. 
The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not 
indicative of future results.
“Primary share class ” means the C share class for 
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and 
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the 
oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an 
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with 
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial 
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, 
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls 
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of 
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, 
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all 
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls 
may occur from time to time, and there can be no 
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in 
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal 
control in the future and collateral consequences 
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal 
control over financial reporting” on page 156  of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2021  Form 10-K for further information. There was 
no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three 
months ended  S e p t e m b e r  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, that has materially
