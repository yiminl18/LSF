PART I  
Item 1.    Business  
Oracle Corporation provides products and services t hat address all aspects of corporate information te chnology (IT) environments—application, 
platform and infrastructure—and are available to cu stomers either via cloud computing or on- premises deployment models. Our products include 
database and middleware software, application softw are, cloud infrastructure software and hardware sys tems (Oracle Engineered Systems, 
servers, storage, networking and industry specific products), along with support and related services.  We offer over 400,000 worldwide 
customers a choice of deployment models to best sui t their needs including (1) the deployment of our p roducts via our Oracle Cloud offerings, 
(2) the acquisition of Oracle products and services  for an on-premises IT environment or (3) a mix of these two models.  
For customers opting for a cloud computing model, O racle offers a wide range of services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a 
Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and In frastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be: rapidly 
deployable to enable customers shorter time to inno vation; easily maintainable to reduce integration a nd testing work; and cost effective by 
requiring lower upfront customer investment. Our Or acle Cloud offerings integrate the software, hardwa re and services on the customers’ behalf 
in IT environments that we deploy, support and mana ge for the customer. We are a leader in the core te chnologies of cloud IT environments, 
including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, cluster ing, large-scale systems management and 
related infrastructure. Our products and services a re the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services , our partners’ cloud services and our 
customers’ cloud IT environments.  
In addition to offering a broad spectrum of cloud p roducts and services, Oracle for decades has develo ped and sold its products and services to 
our customers worldwide for use in their global dat a centers and on- premises IT environments. An important element of o ur corporate strategy is 
to continue our investments in, and innovation with  respect to, our products and services that we offe r through our software and cloud, hardware 
and services businesses. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2 013, we invested $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4. 9 billion, respectively, in research and 
development to enhance our existing portfolio of pr oducts and services and to develop new products and  services. We have a deep understanding 
as to how all components within IT environments—app lication, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another. We focus 
our development efforts on improving the performanc e, operation and integration of these differing tec hnologies to make them more cost-
effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain  for our customers and to improve their computing p erformance relative to our competitors. 
After purchasing Oracle products and services, cust omers can continue to take advantage of Oracle’s re search and development investments and 
deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle  support offerings, which may include product enhan cements that we periodically deliver to 
our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and  JD Edwards application software products, among ot hers, or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS 
and IaaS contracts with us.  
Oracle customers are increasingly electing to run t heir IT environments using our suite of Oracle Clou d offerings. As customers deploy with the 
Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model w hereby certain of their IT resources are deployed a nd managed through the Oracle Cloud, 
while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premises, and both sets of resources can  be managed as one. We focus the 
engineering of our products and services to best co nnect these different deployment models to enable f lexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, 
extensibility and seamlessness.  
A selective and active acquisition program is anoth er important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the 
products and services that we can offer to customer s, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, contribute to our 
revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder val ue. In recent years, we have invested billions of d ollars to acquire a number of companies, 
products, services and technologies that add to, ar e complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue 
to acquire companies, products, services and techno logies to further our corporate strategy.

For more information about the competitive risks we  face, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included el sewhere in this Annual Report.  
Manufacturing  
To produce our hardware products, we rely on both o ur internal manufacturing operations as well as thi rd party manufacturing partners. Our 
internal manufacturing operations consist primarily  of materials procurement, assembly, testing and qu ality control of our Oracle Engineered 
Systems and certain of our enterprise and data cent er servers, storage systems and networking products . For all other manufacturing, we 
generally rely on third party manufacturing partner s to produce our hardware related components and ha rdware products and we may involve our 
internal manufacturing operations in the final asse mbly, testing and quality control processes for the se components and products. We distribute 
most of our hardware products either from our facil ities or partner facilities. Our manufacturing proc esses substantially are based on 
standardization of components across product types,  centralization of assembly and distribution center s and a “build-to-order” methodology in 
which products generally are built only after custo mers have placed firm orders. Production of our har dware products requires that we purchase 
materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full  assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of o ur hardware products, we have existing 
alternate sources of supply or such sources are rea dily available.  
   
16    •   the adoption of cloud based IT offerings including software as a service, platform as a service and in frastructure as a service offerings;  
  •   total cost of ownership;  
  •   ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our prod ucts and services offerings;  
  •   compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within on-premises IT environments and pub lic cloud IT environments, 
including our Oracle Cloud environments;  
  •   the adoption of commodity servers and microprocesso rs;  
  •   the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java tech nology platform and the .NET programming environmen t of 
Microsoft;  
  •   operating system competition among our Oracle Solar is and Linux operating systems, with alternatives i ncluding Microsoft’s Windows 
Server, and other UNIX and Linux operating systems;   
  •   the adoption of open source alternatives to commerc ial software by enterprise software customers;  
  •   products, features and functionality developed inte rnally by customers and their IT staff;  
  •   products, features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems i ntegrators or other third parties; 
and  
  •   attractiveness of offerings from business processin g outsourcers.

However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our 
supply chain operations. Refer to “Risk Factors” in cluded in Item 1A within this Annual Report for add itional discussion of the challenges we 
encounter with respect to the sources and availabil ity of supplies for our products and the related ri sks to our business.  
Research and Development  
We develop the substantial majority of our products  internally. In addition, we have extended our prod uct offerings and intellectual property 
through acquisitions of businesses and technologies . We also purchase or license intellectual property  rights in certain circumstances. Internal 
development allows us to maintain technical control  over the design and development of our products. W e have a number of United States and 
foreign patents and pending applications that relat e to various aspects of our products and technology . While we believe that our patents have 
value, no single patent is essential to us or to an y of our principal business segments. Research and development expenditures were $5.5 billion, 
$5.2 billion and $4.9 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, or 14% of total revenues in  fiscal 2015 and 13% of total revenues in 
each of fiscal 2014 and 2013. Rapid technological a dvances in hardware and software development, evolv ing standards in computer hardware 
and software technology, changing customer needs an d frequent new product introductions and enhancemen ts characterize the software and 
cloud and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount o f resources to research and 
development efforts to maintain and improve our cur rent product and services offerings.  
Employees  
As of May 31, 2015, we employed approximately 132,0 00 full-time employees, including approximately 35, 000 in sales and marketing, 
approximately 11,000 in software license updates an d product support, approximately 6,000 in our cloud  SaaS, PaaS and IaaS operations, 
approximately 1,000 in the manufacturing of our har dware systems products, approximately 5,000 in hard ware systems support, approximately 
23,000 in services, approximately 38,000 in researc h and development and approximately 13,000 in gener al and administrative positions. Of 
these employees, approximately 49,000 were employed  in the United States and approximately 83,000 were  employed internationally. None of 
our employees in the United States is represented b y a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsid iaries labor unions or workers’ councils 
represent some of our employees.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors  
We operate in rapidly changing economic and technol ogical environments that present numerous risks, ma ny of which are driven by factors that 
we cannot control or predict. The following discuss ion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies a nd Estimates” discussion in Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are 
not exhaustive and you should carefully consider th ese risks and uncertainties before investing in our  securities.  
Economic, political and market conditions can adver sely affect our business, results of operations and  financial condition, including our 
revenue growth and profitability, which in turn cou ld adversely affect our stock price.     Our business is influenced by a range of factor s that 
are beyond our control and that we have no comparat ive advantage in forecasting. These include:  
   
   
   
   
Macroeconomic developments like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in Europe and parts of th e United States, Asia and South 
America could negatively affect our business, opera ting results, financial condition and outlook, whic h, in turn, could adversely affect our stock 
price. Any general weakening of, and related declin ing corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or 
corporate spending could cause current or potential  customers to reduce or eliminate their information  technology (IT) budgets and spending, 
which could cause customers to delay, decrease or c ancel purchases of our products and services or cau se customers not to pay us or to delay 
paying us for previously purchased products and ser vices.  
In addition, political unrest in places like Ukrain e, Syria and Iraq and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the 
potential for other hostilities in various parts of  the world, potential public health crises and natu ral disasters continue to contribute to a climate 
of economic and political uncertainty that could ad versely affect our results of operations and financ ial condition, including our revenue growth 
and profitability. These factors generally have the  strongest effect on our sales of new software lice nses, hardware systems products, hardware 
systems support and related services and, to a less er extent, also may affect our renewal rates for so ftware license updates and product support 
and our subscription-based cloud offerings.  
We may experience foreign currency gains and losses . Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our 
revenue and profitability.     We conduct a significant number of transactions  and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Do llar. Changes in 
the values of major foreign currencies, particularl y the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relativ e to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect 
our total assets, revenues, operating results and c ash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In p articular, the economic uncertainties relating 
to European sovereign and other debt obligations ma y cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative  to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign 
currency rates, most notably the recent strengtheni ng of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, adversely a ffects our revenue growth in terms of the 
amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after conver ting our Euro-based results into U.S. Dollars and i n terms of actual demand for our products 
and services as these products become relatively mo re expensive for Euro-based enterprises to purchase . In addition, currency variations can 
adversely affect margins on sales of our products i n countries outside of the United States. Generally , our revenues and operating results are 
adversely affected when the dollar strengthens rela tive to other currencies and are positively affecte d when the dollar weakens. In addition, our 
reported assets generally are adversely affected wh en the dollar strengthens relative to other currenc ies as a significant portion of our 
consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other as sets, are held in foreign currencies. The U.S. doll ar strengthened relative to other currencies, 
including the Euro, in fiscal 2015, which is reflec ted in our results.  
Certain of our international subsidiaries operate i n economies that have been designated as highly inf lationary. We have incurred foreign 
currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in these highly inflationary economies r elative to the U.S. Dollar and we may 
continue to incur such losses in these countries or  other emerging market countries where we do busine ss.  
   
19    •   general economic and business conditions;  
  •   overall demand for enterprise software, cloud offer ings, hardware systems and services;  
  •   governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in gov ernment spending priorities; and  
  •   general political developments.  
Table of Contents  
In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense f ees and other intercompany agreements 
among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cas h settle in the near term, which are charged agains t earnings in the period incurred. We have 
a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency  forward contracts designed to offset the risks ass ociated with certain foreign currency 
exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As a part of this program, we enter into fore ign currency forward contracts so that 
increases or decreases in our foreign currency expo sures are offset at least in part by gains or losse s on the foreign currency forward contracts in 
an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility asso ciated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated 
operations are international, and we expect that we  will continue to realize gains or losses with resp ect to our foreign currency exposures, net of 
gains or losses from our foreign currency forward c ontracts. For example, we will experience foreign c urrency gains and losses in certain 
instances if it is not possible or cost effective t o hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedg ing efforts are ineffective, or should we 
suspend our foreign currency forward contract progr am. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect  to currency fluctuations will generally 
depend on the size and type of cross-currency expos ures that we enter into, the currency exchange rate s associated with these exposures and 
changes in those rates, whether we have entered int o foreign currency forward contracts to offset thes e exposures and other factors. All of these 
factors could materially impact our results of oper ations, financial position and cash flows.  
We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.     Our revenues, particularly our new 
software licenses revenues and hardware systems rev enues, are difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate 
substantially.  
We use a “pipeline” system, a common industry pract ice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of 
all proposals and estimate when a customer will mak e a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated 
periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipe line estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a  particular quarter and over a longer period of 
time, in part because the “conversion rate” or “clo sure rate” of the pipeline into contracts can be ve ry difficult to estimate. A reduction in the 
conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could c ause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely  affect our business or results of operations. In 
particular, a slowdown in IT spending or economic c onditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the con version rate in particular periods as 
purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount  or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affe cted by the tendency of some of our 
customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, whic h can also impede our ability to negotiate, 
execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timel y manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies , we have limited ability to predict how 
their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues  for a number of quarters following the acquisition . Conversion rates post-acquisition may be 
quite different from the acquired companies’ histor ical conversion rates. Differences in conversion ra tes can also be affected by changes in 
business practices that we implement in our newly a cquired companies. These changes may negatively aff ect customer behavior.  
A substantial portion of our new software licenses and hardware systems contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant 
percentage of these are larger orders. Because a si gnificant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, sales and revenue 
shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negati ve impact on our profitability. The number of large  new software licenses transactions and, to a 
lesser extent, hardware systems products transactio ns increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarte rly results because a delay in even a small 
number of these transactions could cause our quarte rly sales, revenues and profitability to fall signi ficantly short of our predictions.  
Our Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Sof tware as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (P aaS), Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.     We offer customers a full range of 
consumption models including the deployment of our products via our cloud based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and D aaS offerings. These business models 
continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compe te effectively, generate significant revenues or ma intain the profitability of our cloud 
offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and  our competitors may unfavorably impact 
the pricing of our on-premises enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings, and has a dampen ing impact on overall demand for our on-
premises software product and service  
   
20  
Table of Contents  
offerings, which could reduce our revenues and prof itability, at least in the near-term. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing 
strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of  our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues 
and profitability could decline.  
Our cloud offerings are generally purchased by cust omers on a subscription basis and revenues from the se offerings are generally recognized 
ratably over the term of the subscriptions. The def erred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in 
sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consoli dated statement of operations. This is in 
contrast to revenues associated with our new softwa re licenses arrangements whereby new software licen ses revenues are generally recognized 
in full at the time of delivery of the related soft ware licenses. We incur certain expenses associated  with the infrastructures and marketing of our 
cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recogn ize the revenues associated with these offerings. A s customer demand for our cloud offerings 
increases, we experience volatility in our reported  revenues and operating results due to the differen ces in timing of revenue recognition between 
our new software licenses arrangements and cloud of fering arrangements.  
We have also acquired a number of cloud computing c ompanies, and the integration of these companies in to our Oracle Cloud strategy may not 
be as efficient or scalable as anticipated, which c ould adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions.  
Our success depends upon our ability to develop new  products and services, integrate acquired products  and services and enhance our 
existing products and services.     Rapid technological advances and evolving standards  in computer hardware and software development and 
communications infrastructure, changing and increas ingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new  product introductions and 
enhancements characterize the industries in which w e compete. If we are unable to develop new or suffi ciently differentiated products and 
services, enhance and improve our products and supp ort services in a timely manner or position and pri ce our products and services to meet 
demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support, hardware support or 
cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these co ntracts are important to the growth of our business . In addition, we cannot provide any 
assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effec tively for business opportunities in 
emerging areas.  
We have continued to refresh and release new offeri ngs of our software and cloud and hardware products  and services, including our Database 
Multitenant, Database In- Memory, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, DaaS and Oracle Engineere d Systems offerings. Our business may be adversely affected if: 
   
   
   
   
   
If our security measures for our software, hardware , services or Oracle Cloud offerings are compromise d and as a result, our data, our 
customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed impr operly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, o ur products and services may be 
perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation c ould be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and 
customers may stop using our products and services,  all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings , increase our expenses and expose 
us to legal claims and regulatory actions.     We are in the information technology business, and our products and services, including our Oracle  
Cloud offerings, store, retrieve, manipulate and ma nage our customers’ information and data, external data, as well as our own data. We have a 
reputation for secure and reliable product offering s and related services and we have invested a great  deal of time and resources in protecting the 
integrity and security of our products, services an d the internal and external data that we manage.  
   
21    •   we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;  
  •   there is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enh anced or acquired product line or service;  
  •   there are changes in information technology trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address wit h our product development 
efforts;  
  •   we do not timely optimize complementary product lin es and services; or  
  •   we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance  acquired product lines or services.

At times, we encounter attempts by third parties to  identify and exploit product and service vulnerabi lities, penetrate or bypass our security 
measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or ou r customers’, partners’ and suppliers’ software, ha rdware and cloud offerings, networks and 
systems, any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential informa tion or data of Oracle or our customers. 
Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other mal icious software programs that could 
attack our products and services, exploit potential  security vulnerabilities of our products and servi ces, create system disruptions and cause 
shutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third party data, products or services incorpor ated into our own. Data may also be accessed 
or modified improperly as a result of customer, par tner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and  third parties may attempt to fraudulently 
induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in 
order to gain access to our data, our customers’, s uppliers’ or partners’ data or the IT systems of Or acle, its customers, suppliers or partners.  
High-profile security breaches at other companies h ave increased in recent years, and security industr y experts and government officials have 
warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attacks  targeting information technology products and busi nesses. Although this is an industry-wide 
problem that affects other software and hardware co mpanies, it affects Oracle in particular because co mputer hackers tend to focus their efforts 
on the most prominent IT companies, and they may fo cus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and ma rketing efforts associated with, having 
secure products and services. These risks will incr ease as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and  store and process increasingly large 
amounts of data, including personal information and  our customers’ confidential information and data a nd other external data, and host or 
manage parts of our customers’ businesses in cloud- based IT environments, especially in customer secto rs involving particularly sensitive data 
such as health sciences, financial services and the  government. We also have an active acquisition pro gram and have acquired a number of 
companies, products, services and technologies over  the years. While we make significant efforts to ad dress any IT security issues with respect 
to our acquired companies, we may still inherit suc h risks when we integrate these companies within Or acle.  
If a cyber-attack or other security incident descri bed above were to allow unauthorized access to or m odification of our customers’ or suppliers’ 
data, other external data or our own data or our IT  systems or if the services we provide to our custo mers were disrupted, or if our products or 
services are perceived as having security vulnerabi lities, we could suffer significant damage to our b rand and reputation. Customers could lose 
confidence in the security and reliability of our p roducts and services, including our cloud offerings , and perceive them to be not secure. This in 
turn could lead to fewer customers using our produc ts and services and result in reduced revenue and e arnings. The costs we would incur to 
address and fix these security incidents would incr ease our expenses. These types of security incident s could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory 
investigations and claims and increased legal liabi lity, including in some cases contractual costs rel ated to customer notification and fraud 
monitoring.  
Our business practices with respect to the collecti on, use and management of personal information coul d give rise to liabilities or 
reputational harm as a result of governmental regul ation, legal requirements or industry standards rel ating to consumer privacy and data 
protection.     As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concern ing the handling of 
personal information expand and become more complex , potential risks related to data collection and us e within our business will intensify. U.S. 
and foreign governments have enacted or are conside ring enacting legislation or regulations, or may in  the near future interpret existing 
legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact the ability of Oracle and our customers and data partners to collect, 
augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain s ervices Oracle provides and data services. 
This could be true particularly in those jurisdicti ons where privacy laws or regulators take a broader  view of how personal information is 
defined, therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstruc tive to the operations of Oracle and its 
customers and data providers. This impact may be ac ute in countries that have passed or are considerin g passing legislation that requires data to 
remain localized “in country”, as this imposes fina ncial costs on any service provider that is require d to store data in jurisdictions not of its 
choosing and nonstandard operational processes that  are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. Regulators globally are also 
imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violati ons, and the European  
   
22  
Table of Contents  
Union (EU) is considering legislation that would im pose fines for privacy violations based on a percen tage of global revenues. Changes in laws 
or regulations associated with the enhanced protect ion of certain types of sensitive data, such as hea lthcare data or other personal information, 
could greatly increase our cost of providing our pr oducts and services or even prevent us from offerin g certain of our services in jurisdictions 
that we operate. Additionally, public perception an d standards related to the privacy of personal info rmation can shift rapidly, in ways that may 
affect Oracle’s reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit Oracle ’s ability to provide certain products. Any 
failure, or perceived failure, by Oracle to comply with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regul ations, including laws and regulations 
regulating privacy, data security, or consumer prot ection, or other policies, public perception, stand ards, self-regulatory requirements or legal 
obligations, could result in lost or restricted bus iness, proceedings, actions or fines brought agains t us or levied by governmental entities or 
others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.  
We might experience significant coding, manufacturi ng or configuration errors in our software, hardwar e and cloud offerings.     Despite 
testing prior to their release and throughout the l ifecycle of a product or service, software, hardwar e and cloud offerings sometimes contain 
coding or manufacturing errors that can impact thei r function, performance and security, and result in  other negative consequences. The 
detection and correction of any errors in released software, hardware or cloud offerings can be time c onsuming and costly. Errors in our 
software, hardware or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software, hardware or cloud offerings, 
could delay the development or release of new produ cts or services or new versions of products or serv ices, could result in creating security 
vulnerabilities in our products or services, and co uld adversely affect market acceptance of our produ cts or services. This includes third party 
software products or services incorporated into our  own. If we experience errors or delays in releasin g our software, hardware or cloud offerings 
or new versions thereof, our sales could be affecte d and revenues could decline. In addition, we run O racle’s business operations as well as cloud 
and other services that we offer to our customers o n our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws c ould affect our ability to conduct our 
business operations and the operations of our custo mers. Enterprise customers rely on our software and  hardware products and services to run 
their businesses and errors in our software, hardwa re or cloud offerings could expose us to product li ability, performance and warranty claims as 
well as significant harm to our brand and reputatio n, which could impact our future sales.  
If we are unable to compete effectively, the result s of operations and prospects for our business coul d be harmed.     We face intense 
competition in all aspects of our business. The nat ure of the IT industry creates a competitive landsc ape that is constantly evolving as firms 
emerge, expand or are acquired, and as technology e volves. Many vendors develop and market databases, middleware products, application 
development tools, business applications, collabora tion products and business intelligence products, a mong others, that compete with our 
software and cloud offerings. These vendors include  on-premises software companies and companies that offer cloud based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS 
and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing  (BPO) as competitive alternatives to buying softwa re and hardware. Our competitors that 
offer business applications and middleware products  may influence a customer’s purchasing decision for  the underlying database in an effort to 
persuade potential customers not to acquire our pro ducts. We could lose customers if our competitors i ntroduce new competitive products, add 
new functionality, acquire competitive products, re duce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing 
competition from open source software initiatives i n which competitors may provide software and intell ectual property for free. Existing or new 
competitors could gain sales opportunities or custo mers at our expense.  
Our hardware systems business competes with, among others, (i) systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own 
microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors, (ii) microprocessor/chip manufactu rers, (iii) providers of storage products 
and (iv) certain industry-specific hardware manufac turers including those serving communications, hosp itality and retail industries. Our 
hardware systems business causes us to compete with  certain companies that historically have been part ners. Some of these competitors may 
have more experience than we do in managing a hardw are business. A large portion of our hardware produ cts are based on our SPARC 
microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform, which has a smaller installed base than c ertain of our competitors’ platforms and 
which may make it difficult for us to win new custo mers that have already made significant investments  in our competitors’ platforms. Certain of 
these competitors also

compete very aggressively on price. A loss in our c ompetitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability, which could adversely 
impact our ability to realize the revenue and profi tability forecasts for our hardware systems busines s.  
Our international sales and operations subject us t o additional risks that can adversely affect our op erating results.     We derive a substantial 
portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our inter national operations include software and 
hardware systems development, manufacturing, assemb ly, sales, customer support, consulting and other s ervices and shared administrative 
service centers.  
Compliance with international and U.S. laws and reg ulations that apply to our international operations  increases our cost of doing business in 
foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations i nclude U.S. laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, 
tax laws, anti- competition regulations, prohibitions on payments t o governmental officials, import and trade restrict ions and export requirements. 
Violations of these laws and regulations could resu lt in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our off icers or our employees, and prohibitions on 
the conduct of our business. Any such violations co uld result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more 
countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisi tions and could also materially damage our reputati on, our brand, our international expansion 
efforts, our ability to attract and retain employee s, our business and our operating results. Complian ce with these laws requires a significant 
amount of management attention and effort, which ma y divert management’ s attention from running our business operations an d could harm our 
ability to grow our business, or may increase our e xpenses as we engage specialized or other additiona l resources to assist us with our 
compliance efforts. Our success depends, in part, o n our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations 
and investigate allegations of improprieties relati ng to transactions and the way in which such transa ctions are recorded. Where circumstances 
warrant, we provide information and report our find ings to government authorities, but no assurance ca n be given that action will not be taken by 
such authorities.  
We are also subject to a variety of other risks and  challenges in managing an organization operating i n various countries, including those related 
to:

As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Ser vices Software Limited (OFSS), a publicly traded co mpany in India, and Oracle Corporation 
Japan (NOKK), a publicly traded company in Japan, w e are faced with several additional risks, includin g being subject to local securities 
regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if OFSS or NOKK were w holly owned subsidiaries.  
   
24    •   general economic conditions in each country or regi on;  
  •   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related  impacts to customer demand and our operating resul ts;  
  •   difficulties in transferring funds from or converti ng currencies in certain countries such as Venezuel a that have led to a devaluation of 
our net assets, in particular our cash assets, in t hat country ’s currency;  
  •   regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be ab le to sufficiently plan for or 
avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or  other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes 
that we may be required to pay in these countries;  
  •   political unrest, terrorism and the potential for o ther hostilities, including those in Ukraine, Syria , Iraq and Yemen;

Acquisitions present many risks and we may not real ize the financial and strategic goals that were con templated at the time of a transaction. 
    In recent years, we have invested billions of d ollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies. A selective and 
active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. 
Risks we may face in connection with our acquisitio n program include:  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
25    •   our ongoing business may be disrupted and our manag ement’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, t ransition or integration 
activities;  
  •   we may have difficulties (i) managing an acquired c ompany’s technologies or lines of business; (ii) en tering new markets where we 
have no or limited direct prior experience or where  competitors may have stronger market positions; or  (iii) retaining key personnel 
from the acquired companies;  
  •   an acquisition may not further our business strateg y as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as 
successfully as we expected or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, ou r investments, which could 
adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition 
including intangible assets and goodwill;  
  •   our operating results or financial condition may be  adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that w e assume from an acquired 
company or technology or that are otherwise related  to an acquisition, including, among others, claims  from government agencies, 
terminated employees, current or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; pre-exi sting contractual relationships of 
an acquired company that we would not have otherwis e entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or 
disruptive to our business; unfavorable revenue rec ognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company’s 
practices; and intellectual property claims or disp utes;  
  •   we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumst ances prior to acquiring a company 
or technology, which could result in unexpected lit igation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable account ing treatment, unexpected 
increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax b enefits or other adverse effects on our business, o perating results or financial condition;  
  •   we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reason s, including if a larger than 
predicted number of customers decline to renew soft ware or hardware support contracts or cloud-based s ubscription contracts, if we are 
unable to sell the acquired products or service off erings to our customer base or if contract models o f an acquired company do not allow 
us to recognize revenues on a timely basis;  
  •   we may have difficulty incorporating acquired techn ologies, products, services and their related suppl y chain operations with our 
existing lines of business and supply chain infrast ructure and maintaining uniform standards, architec ture, controls, procedures and 
policies;  
  •   we may have multiple product lines or services offe rings as a result of our acquisitions that are offe red, priced and supported differently, 
which could cause customer confusion and delays;  
  •   we may have higher than anticipated costs in contin uing support and development of acquired products o r services, in general and 
administrative functions that support new business models, or in compliance with associated regulation s that are more complicated than 
we had anticipated;  
  •   we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, o r may otherwise have certain limitations, restricti ons, penalties or other sanctions 
imposed on us by, worker councils or similar bodies  under applicable employment laws as a result of an  acquisition, which could 
adversely affect our integration plans in certain j urisdictions and potentially increase our integrati on and restructuring expenses;  
  •   we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and anti trust laws on a timely basis, if 
at all, which could, among other things, delay or p revent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the 
expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisi tion or have other adverse effects on our current b usiness and operations;

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, 
particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or  several concurrent acquisitions.  
Our periodic workforce restructurings, including re organizations of our sales force, can be disruptive .     We have in the past restructured or 
made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily, in  response to management changes, product 
changes, performance issues, acquisitions and other  internal and external considerations. In the past,  these types of sales force restructurings 
have resulted in increased restructuring costs, inc reased sales and marketing costs and temporary redu ced productivity while the sales teams 
adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. I n addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expec ted growth or cost savings benefits of these 
restructurings, or do so within the expected timefr ame. These effects could recur in connection with f uture acquisitions and other restructurings 
and our revenues and other results of operations co uld be negatively affected.  
Our hardware systems revenues and profitability cou ld decline if we do not manage the risks associated  with our hardware systems business. 
    Our hardware systems business may adversely aff ect our overall profitability if we do not effectiv ely manage the associated risks. We may not 
achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other fina ncial projections with respect to our hardware syst ems business in a timely manner or at all 
due to a number of factors, including:  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
26    •   our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit o ther potential uses of our cash, including stock re purchases, dividend payments and 
retirement of outstanding indebtedness;  
  •   we may significantly increase our interest expense,  leverage and debt service requirements if we incur  additional debt to pay for an 
acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed  with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain  the necessary funding to 
complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on f avorable terms;  
  •   to the extent that we issue a significant amount of  equity securities in connection with future acquis itions, existing stockholders may be 
diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and  
  •   we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisiti ons pursuant to U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles, including arrangeme nts that we assume from an acquisition.  
  •   as we develop and introduce new versions or next ge nerations of our hardware systems products, custome rs may defer or delay 
purchases of existing hardware systems products and  wait for these new releases, all of which could ad versely affect our hardware 
systems revenues in the short term;  
  •   our hardware systems business has higher expenses a s a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our software and 
cloud business;  
  •   we have focused on our more profitable Oracle Engin eered Systems, such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic 
Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine a nd Oracle SuperCluster products, which are in the r elatively early stages of 
adoption by our customers, and the de-emphasis of o ur lower profit margin commodity hardware systems p roducts could adversely 
affect our hardware systems revenues because the lo wer profit systems have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware 
systems revenues;  
  •   we face a greater risk of potential write-downs and  impairments of inventory, higher warranty expenses  than in our software and cloud 
and services businesses, and amortization and poten tial impairment of intangible assets associated wit h our hardware systems business. 
Any of these items could result in material charges  and adversely affect our operating results;  
  •   we may not be able to increase sales of hardware sy stems support contracts or such increase may take l onger than we anticipate, which 
could result in lower revenues and profitability, o r slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability; and  
  •   we may acquire hardware companies that are strategi cally important to us but (i) operate in hardware b usinesses with historically lower 
operating margins than our own; (ii) have different  legacy business  
Table of Contents  
Our hardware systems offerings are complex products , and if we cannot successfully manage this complex ity, the results of our hardware 
systems business will suffer.     Designing, developing, manufacturing and introducin g new hardware systems products are complicated 
processes. The development process for our hardware  systems products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation. After the 
development phase, we must be able to forecast cust omer demand and manufacture new hardware systems pr oducts in sufficient volumes to 
meet this demand and do so in a cost effective mann er. Our “build-to-order” manufacturing model, in wh ich our hardware systems products 
generally are not built until after customers place  orders, may from time to time experience delays in  delivering our hardware systems products 
to customers in a timely manner. These delays could  cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors. We 
must also manage new hardware product introductions  and transitions to minimize the impact of customer  delayed purchases of existing 
hardware systems products in anticipation of new ha rdware systems product releases. It is also possibl e that we could experience design or 
manufacturing flaws which could delay or prevent th e production of the components for which we have pr eviously committed to pay or need to 
fulfill orders from customers and could also preven t the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned, 
recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues, in creases in warranty costs or costs related to remed iation efforts, damage to our reputation, 
penalties and litigation.  
We depend on suppliers to design, develop, manufact ure and deliver on a timely basis the necessary tec hnologies and components for our 
hardware products, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a si ngle vendor due to price, quality, 
technology, availability or other business constrai nts. As a result, our supply chain operations could  be disrupted or negatively impacted by 
natural disasters, political unrest, port stoppages  or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns o r other factors affecting the countries or 
regions where these single source component vendors  are located or where the products are being shippe d. We may be unable to purchase these 
items from the respective single vendors on accepta ble terms or may experience significant delays or q uality issues in the delivery of necessary 
technologies, parts or components from a particular  vendor. If we had to find a new supplier for these  technologies, parts and components, 
hardware systems product shipments could be delayed , which would adversely affect our hardware systems  revenues. We could also experience 
fluctuations in component prices which, if unantici pated, could negatively impact our hardware systems  business cost structure. Additionally, we 
could experience changes in shipping and logistics of our hardware products, which could result in flu ctuations in prices and negatively impact 
our hardware systems margins. These factors may mak e it difficult for us to plan and procure appropria te component inventory levels in a timely 
fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware pr oducts. Therefore, we may experience component inve ntory shortages which may result in 
production delays or customers choosing to purchase  fewer hardware products from us or systems product s from our competitors. We negotiate 
supply commitments with vendors early in the manufa cturing process to ensure we have sufficient techno logies and components for our 
hardware products to meet anticipated customer dema nd. We must also manage our levels of older compone nt inventories used in our hardware 
products to minimize inventory write-offs or write- downs. If we have excess inventory, it may be neces sary to write-down the inventory, which 
would adversely affect our operating results. If on e or more of the risks described above occurs, our hardware systems business and related 
operating results could be materially and adversely  affected.  
We are susceptible to third party manufacturing and  logistics delays, which could result in the loss o f sales and customers.     We outsource 
the design, manufacturing, assembly and delivery of  certain of our hardware products to a variety of c ompanies, many of which are located 
outside the United States. Our reliance on these th ird parties reduces our control over the design, ma nufacturing and delivery process, exposing 
us to risks, including reduced control over quality  assurance, product costs, product supply and deliv ery delays as well as the political and 
economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the  international locations where certain of these thi rd party manufacturers have facilities and 
operations. Some countries may raise national secur ity concerns or  
   
27    practices and go-to-market strategies that we may a lter as a part of our integration efforts, which ma y significantly impact our estimated 
revenues and profits from the acquired company; (ii i) leverage different platforms or competing techno logies that we may encounter 
difficulties in integrating; or (iv) utilize unique  manufacturing processes that affect our ability to  scale these acquired products within 
our own manufacturing operations.  
Table of Contents  
impose market access restrictions based on location  of manufacture or sourcing. Any manufacturing disr uption or logistics delays by these third 
parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware systems products for extended pe riods of time. If we are unable to manage our 
relationships with these third parties effectively,  or if these third parties experience delays, disru ptions, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or 
quality control problems in their operations, or fa il to meet our future requirements for timely deliv ery, our ability to ship and deliver certain of 
our hardware systems products to our customers coul d be impaired and our hardware systems business cou ld be harmed.  
We have simplified our supply chain processes by re ducing the number of third party manufacturing part ners and the number of locations where 
these third party manufacturers build our hardware systems products. We therefore have become more dep endent on a fewer number of these 
manufacturing partners and locations. If these part ners experience production problems or delays or ca nnot meet our demand for products, we 
may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sou rces in a timely or cost effective manner, if at al l. If we are required to change third party 
manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled ha rdware systems products deliveries to our customers  could be adversely affected, which could 
cause the loss of sales and existing or potential c ustomers, delayed revenue recognition or an increas e in our hardware systems products 
expenses, all of which could adversely affect the m argins of our hardware business.  
These challenges and risks also exist when we acqui re companies with hardware products and related sup ply chain operations. In some cases, we 
may be dependent, at least initially, on these acqu ired companies’ supply chain operations that we are  less familiar with and thus we may be 
slower to adjust or react to these challenges and r isks.  
Our software indirect sales channel could affect ou r future operating results.     Our software indirect channel network is compri sed primarily 
of resellers, system integrators/implementers, cons ultants, education providers, internet service prov iders, network integrators and independent 
software vendors. Our relationships with these chan nel participants are important elements of our soft ware marketing and sales efforts. Our 
financial results could be adversely affected if ou r contracts with channel participants were terminat ed, if our relationships with channel 
participants were to deteriorate, if any of our com petitors enter into strategic relationships with or  acquire a significant channel participant, if the 
financial condition or operations of our channel pa rticipants were to weaken or if the level of demand  for our channel participants’ products and 
services were to decrease. There can be no assuranc e that we will be successful in maintaining, expand ing or developing our relationships with 
channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue s.  
We may not be able to protect our intellectual prop erty rights.     We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and tra de secret laws, confidentiality 
procedures, controls and contractual commitments to  protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be 
limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy  or reverse engineer portions of our products or ot herwise obtain and use our intellectual 
property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidate d, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending o r future patent applications, whether or 
not being currently challenged, may not be issued w ith the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not 
provide the same level of protection of our intelle ctual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States. If we cannot protect our 
intellectual property rights against unauthorized c opying or use, or other misappropriation, we may no t remain competitive.  
Third parties have claimed and, in the future, may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual proper ty rights and/or breach of license 
agreement provisions.     We periodically receive notices from, or have l awsuits filed against us by, others claiming infrin gement or other 
misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or  breach of our agreements with them. These third pa rties include entities that do not have the 
capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual p roperty like patents for the sole purpose of 
monetizing their acquired intellectual property thr ough asserting claims of infringement and misuse. W e expect the number of such claims will 
increase as:  
   
   
   
   
28    •   we continue to acquire companies and expand into ne w businesses;  
  •   the number of products and competitors in our indus try segments grows;  
  •   the use and support of third party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the ind ustry;

Responding to any such claim, regardless of its val idity, could:  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.     We rely on the continued service of our senior 
management, including our Executive Chairman of the  Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and f ounder, our Chief Executive Officers, 
other members of our executive team and other key e mployees and the hiring of new qualified employees.  In the technology industry, there is 
substantial and continuous competition for highly s killed business, product development, technical and  other personnel. In addition, acquisitions 
could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquire d companies or at Oracle. We may also experience in creased compensation costs that are not 
offset by either improved productivity or higher sa les. We may not be successful in recruiting new per sonnel and in retaining and motivating 
existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not  have long-term employment or non-competition agree ments with our employees. Members 
of our senior management team have left Oracle over  the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional 
departures, which may be disruptive to our operatio ns.  
We continually focus on improving our cost structur e by hiring personnel in countries where advanced t echnical expertise and other expertise are 
available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay 
the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure . We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend 
toward globalization continues, which may affect ou r employee retention efforts and increase our expen ses in an effort to offer a competitive 
compensation program. Our general compensation prog ram includes stock options and restricted stock uni ts (RSUs), which are important tools 
in attracting and retaining employees in our indust ry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adve rsely affect our ability to retain or attract 
employees. In addition, because we expense all stoc k-based compensation, we have changed and may in th e future change our stock-based and 
other compensation practices. For example, in fisca l 2015, we introduced RSU grants for certain of our  employees and performance related stock 
unit grants for certain of our executives. We conti nue to evaluate our compensation practices and othe r changes we consider from time to time 
include a reduction in the number of employees gran ted equity awards, a reduction in the number of sto ck options or RSUs granted per employee 
and alternative forms of stock-based compensation, all of which may have an impact on our ability to r etain employees and also impact the 
amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices o r changes made by competitors could 
affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.  
Our sales to government clients subject us to busin ess volatility and risks, including government budg eting cycles and appropriations, early 
termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.     We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S.  government, state and local 
governments, and foreign governments and their resp ective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. 
There is increased pressure for governments and the ir agencies, both domestically and internationally,  to reduce spending. Further, our U.S. 
federal government contracts are subject to the app roval of appropriations made by the U.S. Congress t o fund the expenditures under these 
contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state an d local levels in the U.S. and our contracts with f oreign governments and their agencies are 
generally subject to government

  •   require us to stop selling or to redesign certain o f our products;  
  •   require us to release source code to third parties,  possibly under open source license terms;  
  •   require us to satisfy indemnification obligations t o our customers; or  
  •   otherwise adversely affect our business, results of  operations, financial condition or cash flows.

funding authorizations. Additionally, government co ntracts are generally subject to audits and investi gations which could result in various civil 
and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions , including termination of contracts, refund of a p ortion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, 
suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or de barment from future government business.  
We may need to change our pricing models to compete  successfully.     The intense competition we face in the sales of  our products and 
services and general economic and business conditio ns can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on 
certain products or services or develop products th at the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other 
favorable terms in order to compete successfully. A ny such changes may reduce margins and could advers ely affect operating results. 
Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud an d SaaS delivery models offered by us and our compet itors may unfavorably impact the 
pricing of our on-premises enterprise software offe rings and our cloud offerings, as well as overall d emand for our on- premises software product 
and service offerings, which could reduce our reven ues and profitability. Our software license updates  and product support fees and hardware 
systems support fees are generally priced as a perc entage of our net new software licenses fees and ne t new hardware systems products fees, 
respectively. Our competitors may offer lower prici ng on their support offerings, which could put pres sure on us to further discount our product 
or support pricing.  
Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing po licies could cause our revenues to decline or be de layed as our sales force implements and 
our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. S ome of our competitors may bundle products for prom otional purposes or as a long-term 
pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices an d product implementations. These practices could, o ver time, significantly constrain the prices 
that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect chang es in customer use of our products or 
changes in customer demand, our revenues could decr ease. The increase in open source software distribu tion may also cause us to change our 
pricing models.  
We may not receive significant revenues from our cu rrent research and development efforts for several years, if at all.     Developing 
software, cloud and hardware offerings is expensive  and the investment in the development of these off erings often involves a long return on 
investment cycle. An important element of our corpo rate strategy is to continue to make significant in vestments in research and development and 
related product and service opportunities both thro ugh internal investments and the acquisition of int ellectual property from companies that we 
have acquired. Accelerated product and service intr oductions and short software and hardware life cycl es require high levels of expenditures for 
research and development that could adversely affec t our operating results if not offset by revenue in creases. We believe that we must continue 
to dedicate a significant amount of resources to ou r research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not 
expect to receive significant revenues from these i nvestments for several years, if at all.  
Business disruptions could adversely affect our ope rating results.     A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in 
a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated b usiness and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales 
and providing services, including some of our cloud  offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catas trophic event that results in the destruction 
or disruption of any of our critical business or IT  systems could severely affect our ability to condu ct normal business operations and, as a result, 
our future operating results could be materially an d adversely affected.  
Adverse litigation results could affect our busines s.     We are subject to various legal proceedings. Li tigation can be lengthy, expensive and 
disruptive to our operations, and can divert our ma nagement’s attention away from running our core bus iness. The results of our litigation also 
cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse deci sion could result in monetary damages or injunctive  relief that could affect our business, 
operating results or financial condition. Additiona l information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included  elsewhere in this Annual Report.  
We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.      As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income 
based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is requ ired in determining our worldwide provision 
for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions 
taken by us on our tax returns.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a signi ficantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, the United States, many 
countries in the EU, and other countries where we d o business, are actively considering changes in rel evant tax, accounting and other laws, 
regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals,  which, if enacted, could have a significant 
adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and 
calculations where the ultimate tax determination i s uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to add itional audits in the future. Although, we 
have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilate ral Advance Pricing Agreements that 
cover some of our intercompany transfer pricing iss ues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment 
within the scope of these agreements, these agreeme nts do not cover substantial elements of our transf er pricing. In recent periods, transfer 
pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have b ecome increasingly contentious. Similarly, certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising 
concerns about certain withholding tax matters. In addition, our provision for income taxes could be a dversely affected by earnings being lower 
than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider  to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United S tates that have lower statutory tax rates and 
earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdict ions that have higher statutory tax rates.  
We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such  as payroll, sales, use, value- added, net worth, property and goods and services t axes, in both 
the United States and various foreign jurisdictions . We are regularly under audit by tax authorities w ith respect to these non-income based taxes 
and may have exposure to additional non-income base d tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax 
exposures, particularly with our entry into the har dware systems business, which increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations 
that we are subject to and with which we must compl y.  
Although we believe that our income and non- income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is  no assurance that the final determination of tax 
audits or tax disputes will not be different from w hat is reflected in our historical income tax provi sions and accruals.  
Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may  adversely affect our operating results.     Under business combination accounting 
standards pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations , we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, th e liabilities assumed and any non-
controlling interests in acquired companies general ly at their acquisition date fair values and, in ea ch case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as 
of the acquisition date is measured as the excess a mount of consideration transferred, which is also g enerally measured at fair value, and the net 
of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable  assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our e stimates of fair value are based upon 
assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are  inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisi tion, the following factors could result in 
material charges and adversely affect our operating  results and may adversely affect our cash flows:  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
31    •   costs incurred to combine the operations of compani es we acquire, such as transitional employee expens es and employee retention, 
redeployment or relocation expenses;  
  •   impairment of goodwill, in particular within our co nsulting reporting unit, or impairment of intangibl e assets, both of which we have 
added to significantly in recent years and may cont inue to increase in the future;  
  •   amortization of intangible assets acquired;  
  •   a reduction in the useful lives of intangible asset s acquired;  
  •   identification of, or changes to, assumed contingen t liabilities, both income tax and non- income tax related, after our final determination 
of the amounts for these contingencies or the concl usion of the measurement period (generally up to on e year from the acquisition date), 
whichever comes first;  
  •   charges to our operating results to maintain certai n duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended  period of time or to maintain these 
activities for a period of time that is longer than  we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain d uplicative pre-merger activities, and 
charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;  
Table of Contents  
   
Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income a nd earnings per share for the periods in 
which those costs are incurred. For example, we rec ognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth qu arter of fiscal 2015 relating to our 
hardware systems reporting unit. Charges to our ope rating results in any given period could differ sub stantially from other periods based on the 
timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities. A more detailed d iscussion of our accounting for business 
combinations and other items is presented in the “C ritical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of Management’ s Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (I tem 7).  
There are risks associated with our outstanding and  future indebtedness.     As of May 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $42. 0 billion of 
outstanding indebtedness that will mature between c alendar year 2016 and calendar year 2055 and we may  incur additional indebtedness in the 
future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the p rincipal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our  ability to manage our business operations, 
generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt  and the other factors discussed in this section. T here can be no assurance that we will be able 
to manage any of these risks successfully.  
We may also need to refinance a portion of our outs tanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we  may not be able to refinance existing debt 
or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthe rmore, if prevailing interest rates or other 
factors at the time of refinancing result in higher  interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest  expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness 
would increase. Should we incur future increases in  interest expense, our ability to utilize certain o f our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. 
federal income tax could be limited, which could un favorably affect our provision for income taxes and  effective tax rate. In addition, changes 
by any rating agency to our outlook or credit ratin g could negatively affect the value of both our deb t and equity securities and increase the 
interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future de bt. These risks could adversely affect our financia l condition and results of operations.  
Environmental and other related laws and regulation s subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.     
Some of our cloud and hardware systems operations a re subject to state, federal and international laws  governing protection of the environment, 
proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of  certain chemical substances and the labor 
practices of suppliers. We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws, yet compliance with these environmental and other laws 
could increase our product design, development, pro curement, manufacturing, delivery and administratio n costs, limit our ability to manage 
excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change  our sales activities, or otherwise impact future f inancial results of our cloud and hardware 
systems businesses. Any violation of these laws can  subject us to significant liability, including fin es, penalties and possible prohibition of sales 
of our products and services into one or more state s or countries and result in a material adverse eff ect on the financial condition or results of 
operations of our cloud and hardware systems busine sses.  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has ado pted disclosure requirements for companies that use  certain “conflict 
minerals” (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, t ungsten and gold) in their products. Our supply cha in is multi-tiered, global and highly 
complex. As a provider of hardware systems end prod ucts, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict 
minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our abil ity to determine with certainty the origin and chai n of custody of conflict minerals is limited. 
Our relationships with customers and suppliers coul d suffer if we are unable to describe our products as “conflict-free.” We may also face 
increased costs in complying with conflict minerals  disclosure requirements.  
A significant portion of our hardware systems reven ues come from international sales. Environmental le gislation, such as the EU Directive on 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive  (WEEE Directive) and China’s 
regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Po llution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing 
business internationally and impact our hardware sy stems revenues from the EU, China and other countri es with similar environmental 
legislation as we endeavor to comply with and imple ment these requirements. The cumulative impact of i nternational environmental legislation 
could be significant.

  •   charges to our operating results due to the expensi ng of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisitio n.

Our stock price could become more volatile and your  investment could lose value.     All of the factors discussed in this section co uld affect our 
stock price. The timing of announcements in the pub lic market regarding new products, product enhancem ents or technological advances by our 
competitors or us and any announcements by us of ac quisitions, major transactions, or management chang es could also affect our stock price. 
Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repur chases or dividends could adversely affect our stoc k price. Our stock price is subject to 
speculation in the press and the analyst community,  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates b y financial analysts, changes in 
investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelat ed to our performance. A significant drop in 
our stock price could also expose us to the risk of  securities class actions lawsuits, which could res ult in substantial costs and divert 
management’s attention and resources, which could a dversely affect our business.

all of which we own. We lease our principal interna l manufacturing facility for our hardware systems p roducts in Hillsboro, Oregon. We also 
own or lease other office facilities for current us e consisting of approximately 25.6 million square f eet in various other locations in the United 
States and abroad. We believe our facilities are in  good condition and suitable for the conduct of our  business. Approximately 2.5 million square 
feet, or 9%, of total owned and leased space is sub let or is being actively marketed for sublease or d isposition.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Ex change under the symbol “ORCL”. Prior to July 15, 2 013, our common stock traded on 
the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “O RCL”. According to the records of our transfer agen t, we had 11,383 stockholders of 
record as of May 31, 2015. The following table sets  forth the low and high sale prices per share of ou r common stock, based on the last daily 
sale, in each of our last eight fiscal quarters.  
   
We declared and paid cash dividends totaling $0.51 and $0.48 per outstanding common share over the cou rse of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, 
respectively.  
In June 2015, our Board of Directors declared a qua rterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outs tanding common stock payable on July 29, 
2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of b usiness on July 8, 2015. We currently expect to con tinue paying comparable cash dividends on 
a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record an d payment dates are subject to the final 
determination of our Board of Directors.  
For equity compensation plan information, please re fer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report.  
Stock Repurchase Programs  
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for u s to repurchase shares of our common stock. On Sept ember 18, 2014, we announced that 
our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our  stock repurchase program by an additional $13.0 bi llion. Approximately $9.2 billion 
remained available for stock repurchases as of May 31, 2015 pursuant to our stock repurchase program.  
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an  expiration date and the pace of our repurchase act ivity will depend on factors such as our 
working capital needs, our cash requirements for ac quisitions and dividend payments, our debt repaymen t obligations or repurchases of our debt, 
our stock price and economic and market conditions.  Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to  time through open market purchases or 
pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchas e program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or  discontinued at any time.  
The following table summarizes the stock repurchase  activity for the three months ended May 31, 2015 a nd the approximate dollar value of 
shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our st ock repurchase program:

  Our results of operations for fiscal 2015 compare d to fiscal 2014 were significantly impacted by mov ements in international currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our 
fiscal 2015 total revenues by 4 percentage points, total operating expenses by 3 percentage points and  total operating income by 6 percentage points in c omparison to fiscal 2014.  
  Total working capital sequentially increased in m ost periods primarily due to the favorable impact t o our net current assets resulting from our net inc ome generated during these periods 
and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20. 0 billion in fiscal 2015, €2.0 billion and $3.0 bil lion in fiscal 2014 and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013 . These increases were partially offset 
by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of commo n stock and dividend payments made in all periods p resented and repayments of certain of our senior no tes in fiscal 2015, 2013 and 
2011.  
  Our notes payable and other borrowings, which rep resented the summation of our notes payable, curren t and other current borrowings, and notes payable a nd other non-current 
borrowings as reported per our consolidated balance  sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2015 due t o the issuances of long-term senior 
notes of $20.0 billion in fiscal 2015, €2.0 billion  and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014, and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013, and $1.7 billion of short-term borr owings made pursuant to our revolving 
credit agreement in fiscal 2012. See Note 8 of Note s to Consolidated Financial Statements included els ewhere in this Annual Report for additional informa tion regarding our notes

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Fi nancial Condition and Results of Operations with an  overview of our key operating 
business segments and significant trends. This over view is followed by a summary of our critical accou nting policies and estimates that we 
believe are important to understanding the assumpti ons and judgments incorporated in our reported fina ncial results. We then provide a more 
detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  
Business Overview  
Oracle Corporation provides products and services t hat address all aspects of corporate information te chnology (IT) environments—application, 
platform and infrastructure—and are available to cu stomers either via cloud computing or on- premises deployment models. Our products include 
database and middleware software, application softw are, cloud infrastructure software, and hardware sy stems (Oracle Engineered Systems, 
servers, storage, networking and industry specific products), along with support and related services.  We offer over 400,000 worldwide 
customers a choice of deployment models to best sui t their needs including (1) the deployment of our p roducts via our Oracle Cloud offerings, 
(2) the acquisition of Oracle products and services  for an on-premises IT environment or (3) a mix of these two models.  
For customers opting for a cloud computing model, O racle offers a wide range of services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a 
Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and In frastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be: rapidly 
deployable to enable customers shorter time to inno vation; easily maintainable to reduce integration a nd testing work; and cost effective by 
requiring lower upfront customer investment. Our Or acle Cloud offerings integrate the software, hardwa re and services on the customers’ behalf 
in IT environments that we deploy, support and mana ge for the customer. We are a leader in the core te chnologies of cloud IT environments, 
including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, cluster ing, large-scale systems management and 
related infrastructure. Our products and services a re the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services , our partners’ cloud services and our 
customers’ cloud IT environments.  
In addition to offering a broad spectrum of cloud p roducts and services, Oracle for decades has develo ped and sold its products and services to 
our customers worldwide for use in their global dat a centers and on- premises IT environments. An important element of o ur corporate strategy is 
to continue our investments in, and innovation with  respect to, our products and services that we offe r through our software and cloud, hardware 
and services businesses. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2 013, we invested $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4. 9 billion, respectively, in research and 
development to enhance our existing portfolio of pr oducts and services and to develop new products and  services. We have a deep understanding 
as to how all components within IT environments—app lication, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another. We focus 
our development efforts on improving the performanc e, operation and integration of these differing tec hnologies to make them more cost-
effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain  for our customers and to improve their computing p erformance relative to our competitors. 
After purchasing Oracle products and services, cust omers can continue to take advantage of Oracle’s re search and development investments and 
deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle  support offerings, which may include product enhan cements that we periodically deliver to 
our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and  JD Edwards application software products, among ot hers, or renewing their SaaS, PaaS and 
IaaS contracts with us.  
Oracle customers are increasingly electing to run t heir IT environments using our suite of Oracle Clou d offerings. As customers deploy with the 
Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model w hereby certain of their IT resources are deployed a nd managed through the Oracle Cloud, 
while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premises, and both sets of resources can  be managed as one. We focus the 
engineering of our products and services to best co nnect these different deployment models to enable f lexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, 
extensibility and seamlessness.  
A selective and active acquisition program is anoth er important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the 
products and services that we can offer to customer s, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our 
revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder val ue.

Table of Contents  
In recent years, we have invested billions of dolla rs to acquire a number of companies, products, serv ices and technologies that add to, are 
complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our ex isting offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and 
technologies to further our corporate strategy.  
We have three businesses that deliver our applicati on, platform and infrastructure technologies: softw are and cloud, hardware systems, and 
services. These businesses can be further divided i nto certain operating segments (Note 16 of Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements, 
included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our operating seg ments). Each of our businesses and 
operating segments has unique characteristics and f aces different opportunities and challenges. Althou gh we report our actual results in U.S. 
Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transac tions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Theref ore, we present constant currency 
information to provide a framework for assessing ho w our underlying businesses performed excluding the  effects of foreign currency rate 
fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses a nd related operating segments follows.  
Software and Cloud Business  
Our software and cloud business, which represented 77%, 76% and 75% of our total revenues in fiscal 20 15, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is 
comprised of three operating segments: (1) new soft ware licenses and cloud software subscriptions, (2)  cloud infrastructure as a service and 
(3) software license updates and product support. O n a constant currency basis, we expect that our sof tware and cloud business’ total revenues 
generally will continue to increase due to continue d demand for our software products and cloud softwa re subscription offerings, our software 
license updates and product support offerings, incl uding the high percentage of customers that renew t heir software license updates and product 
support contracts, and our acquisitions, which shou ld allow us to grow and continue to make investment s in research and development.  
New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscripti ons:     Our new software licenses and cloud software su bscriptions line of business 
markets, sells and delivers our application and pla tform technologies including our SaaS and PaaS offe rings (our SaaS and PaaS offerings are 
collectively referred to as cloud software subscrip tions), which provide customers a choice of softwar e applications and platforms that are 
delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and support, and the licensing of our software products including Oracle 
Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middle ware and Java, among others. Our application and pl atform technologies are substantially 
built on standards-based architectures that are des igned to help customers reduce the cost and complex ity of their IT infrastructure. Our 
commitment to industry standards results in softwar e that works in customer environments with Oracle o r non-Oracle hardware or software 
components and that can be adapted to meet specific  industry or business needs. We focus the engineeri ng of our products and services to best 
connect cloud and on- premises deployment models to enable flexibility, e ase, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seam lessness. Our software 
offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurati ons for cloud or on-premises IT 
environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Mic rosoft Windows and third party UNIX 
products, among others. These approaches are design ed to support customer choice and reduce customer r isk. Our customers include businesses 
of many sizes, government agencies, educational ins titutions and resellers. We market and sell our sof tware products and services to these 
customers with a sales force positioned to offer th e combinations that best fit their needs. We enable  customers to evolve and transform to 
substantially any IT environment at whatever pace i s most appropriate for them.  
The growth in our new software licenses and our Saa S and PaaS revenues that we report is affected by t he strength of general economic and 
business conditions, governmental budgetary constra ints, the competitive position of our software offe rings, our acquisitions and foreign 
currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software license transactions are character ized by long sales cycles and the timing of a 
few large software license transactions can substan tially affect our quarterly new software licenses r evenues. New software licenses and cloud 
software subscriptions revenues represented 26% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015 and 28% in each o f fiscal 2014 and 2013. Our cloud 
software subscriptions contracts, which consist of SaaS and PaaS arrangements, are generally one to th ree years in duration and we strive to 
renew these contracts when they are eligible for re newal. Our new software licenses and cloud software  subscriptions segment’s margin has 
historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due t o the historical  
   
38  
Table of Contents  
upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majori ty of our costs for this segment are 
predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our  new software licenses and cloud software subscript ions segment’ s margin has been and will 
continue to be affected by the fair value adjustmen ts relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations that we assumed in our business 
combinations (described further below) and by the a mortization of intangible assets associated with co mpanies and technologies that we have 
acquired.  
For certain of our acquired businesses, we recorded  adjustments to reduce the cloud SaaS and PaaS obli gations to their estimated fair values at 
the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not r ecognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues 
related to acquired contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as in dependent entities in the amounts of $12 
million, $17 million and $45 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underl ying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are 
renewed with us following an acquisition, we will r ecognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over their respective contractual 
periods.  
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service:     Our cloud infrastructure as a service offerings, wh ich represented 2% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015 
and 1% in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013, provide com prehensive software and hardware management and mai ntenance services for customer IT 
infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select  partner data centers or physically on-premises at 
customer facilities; deployment and management offe rings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine 
instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storag e; and certain of our Oracle Engineered 
Systems and related support offerings that are depl oyed in our customers’ data centers for a monthly f ee.  
Software License Updates and Product Support:     Customers that purchase software license update s and product support are granted rights to 
unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releas es and patches released during the term of the supp ort period, as well as technical support 
assistance. Our software license updates and produc t support contracts are generally one year in durat ion. Substantially all of our software 
license customers renew their software license upda tes and product support contracts annually. The gro wth of software license updates and 
product support revenues is primarily influenced by  three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews 
its software support contracts, (2) the amount of n ew software support contracts sold in connection wi th the sale of new software licenses and 
(3) the amount of software support contracts assume d from companies we have acquired.  
Software license updates and product support revenu es, which represented 49%, 47% and 46% of our total  revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 
2013, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins during fiscal 20 15 were 90% and accounted for 81% of 
our total margins over the same period. Our softwar e license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments 
relating to software support obligations assumed in  business combinations (described further below) an d by amortization of intangible assets. 
However, over the longer term, we believe that soft ware license updates and product support revenues a nd margins will grow for the following 
reasons:  
   
   
   
We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to the ir estimated fair values at the 
acquisition dates. As a result, as required by busi ness combination accounting rules,  
   
39    •   substantially all of our customers, including custo mers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible 
for renewal;  
  •   substantially all of our customers purchase softwar e license updates and product support contracts whe n they buy new software licenses, 
resulting in a further increase in our software sup port contract base. Even if new software licenses r evenues growth was flat, software 
license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding  prior year periods assuming 
contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign  currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software 
licenses transactions result in the sale of softwar e license updates and product support contracts, wh ich add to our software support 
contract base; and  
  •   our acquisitions have increased our software suppor t contract base, as well as the portfolio of produc ts available to be licensed and 
supported.  
Table of Contents  
we did not recognize software license updates and p roduct support revenues related to software support  contracts that would have been otherwise 
recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 
2013, respectively. To the extent underlying softwa re support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the 
revenues for the full values of the software suppor t contracts over the respective support periods, th e majority of which are one year.  
Hardware Systems Business  
Our hardware systems business is comprised of two o perating segments: (1) hardware systems products an d (2) hardware systems support. Our 
hardware business represented 14% of our total reve nues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. We expect our h ardware business to have lower 
operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software and cloud business due to the incremen tal costs we incur to produce and 
distribute these products and to provide support se rvices, including direct materials and labor costs.  We expect to make investments in research 
and development to improve existing hardware produc ts and services and to develop new hardware product s and services.  
Hardware Systems Products:     We provide a broad selection of hardware system s and related services including Oracle Engineered Systems, 
servers, storage, networking, workstations and rela ted devices, industry specific hardware, virtualiza tion software, operating systems, and 
management software to support diverse IT environme nts, including cloud computing environments. We eng ineer our hardware systems with 
virtualization and management capabilities to enabl e the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premises IT 
infrastructures. Our hardware products support many  of the world’s largest cloud infrastructures, incl uding the Oracle Cloud.  
Our hardware systems products are designed to be ea sier to deploy, manage and maintain for our custome rs and to improve computing 
performance relative to our competitors’ offerings.  We design our hardware products to seamlessly conn ect on-premises and cloud IT 
environments to further enable interoperability, in terchangeability and extendibility and to work in c ustomer environments that may include 
other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software com ponents. Our flexible and open approach provides Or acle customers with a broad range of 
choices in how they deploy our hardware products, w hich we believe is a priority for our customers.  
Oracle Engineered Systems are core to our hardware offerings and are important elements of our data ce nter and cloud computing offerings 
including the Oracle Cloud. These pre-integrated pr oducts are designed to integrate multiple Oracle te chnology components to work together to 
deliver improved performance, availability, securit y and operational efficiency relative to our compet itors’ products, to be upgraded effectively 
and efficiently and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patchin g. Oracle Engineered Systems are tested 
before they are shipped to customers and delivered ready-to-run, enabling customers to shorten the tim e to production.  
We offer a wide range of server systems using our S PARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Orac le Solaris operating system and are 
designed to be differentiated by their reliability,  security, and scalability. Our mid- size and large servers are designed to offer better  performance 
and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe sy stems for business critical applications, for custo mers having more computationally 
intensive needs, and as platforms for building clou d computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle 
SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems.   
We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 ser vers are based on microprocessors from Intel Corpor ation and are compatible with Oracle 
Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle 
Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata Databas e Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Ex alytics In-Memory Machine and the 
Oracle Big Data Appliance.  
Our storage products are designed to securely manag e, protect, archive and restore customers’ mission critical data assets and consist of tape, 
disk, flash and hardware-related software including  file systems software, back-up and archive softwar e and storage management software and 
networking for mainframe and open systems environme nts.

Our networking and data center fabric products, inc luding Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle Infini Band and Ethernet technologies, are used 
with our server and storage products and are integr ated into our management tools to help enterprise c ustomers improve infrastructure 
performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplif y storage and server connectivity.  
We offer hardware products and services designed fo r specific industries. Our point-of-sale hardware o fferings include point-of-sale terminals 
and related hardware that are designed for managing  businesses within the food and beverage, hotel and  retail industries, among others. Our 
hardware products and services for communications n etworks include network signaling, policy control a nd subscriber data management 
solutions, and session border control technology, a mong others.  
The majority of our hardware systems products are s old through indirect channels, including independen t distributors and value added resellers.  
To produce our hardware products, we rely on both o ur internal manufacturing operations as well as thi rd party manufacturing partners. Our 
internal manufacturing operations consist primarily  of materials procurement, assembly, testing and qu ality control of our Oracle Engineered 
Systems and certain of our enterprise and data cent er servers and storage systems. For all other manuf acturing, we generally rely on third party 
manufacturing partners to produce our hardware rela ted components and hardware products and we may inv olve our internal manufacturing 
operations in the final assembly, testing and quali ty control processes for these components and produ cts. We distribute most of our hardware 
products either from our facilities or partner faci lities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying ou r manufacturing processes through increased 
standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in whi ch products generally are built only 
after customers have placed firm orders.  
Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of har dware systems products and hardware systems operati ng margins that we report are affected 
by our strategy for and the competitive position of  our hardware systems products, the strength of gen eral economic and business conditions, 
governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations . In addition, our operating margins for our 
hardware systems products segment have been and wil l be affected by the amortization of intangible ass ets.  
Our quarterly hardware systems products revenues ar e difficult to predict. The timing of customer orde rs and delays in our ability to timely 
manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transac tions, among other factors, could substantially aff ect the amount of hardware systems 
products revenues, expenses and operating margins t hat we report.  
Hardware Systems Support:     Our hardware systems support offerings provide cust omers with software updates for software components  that 
are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product 
repairs, maintenance services and technical support  services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are priced as a 
percentage of the net hardware systems products fee s, are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of  the support period and are one year in 
duration. We continue to evolve hardware systems su pport processes that are intended to proactively id entify and solve quality issues and to 
increase the amount of new and renewed hardware sys tems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. 
Our hardware systems support revenues that we repor t are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware 
products, the mix of hardware products purchased, w hether customers decide to purchase hardware system s support contracts at or in close 
proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the  percentage of our hardware systems support contrac t customer base that renews its support 
contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all o f these factors are heavily influenced by our custo mers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade 
their existing hardware systems’ infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available.  
Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and  related accounting, including fair value 
adjustments relating to hardware systems support ob ligations assumed, and by the amortization of intan gible assets. As required by business 
combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustmen ts to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our 
acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware system s support revenues by

the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 mill ion for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. To the extent underlying hardware sys tems support contracts are renewed with us followin g an acquisition, we will recognize the 
revenues for the full values of the hardware system s support contracts over the respective support per iods.  
Services Business  
Our services business, which represented 9%, 10% an d 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively, is 
comprised of the remainder of our operating segment s. Our services business has lower margins than our  software and cloud and hardware 
businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by o ur strategy for and the competitive position of our  services, certain of our acquisitions, 
general economic conditions, governmental budgetary  constraints, personnel reductions in our customers ’ IT departments, tighter controls over 
discretionary spending and the growth in our softwa re and hardware systems products revenues. Our serv ices business’ offerings include:  
   
   
   
Acquisitions  
A selective and active acquisition program is anoth er important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of 
dollars to acquire a number of complementary compan ies, products, services and technologies including MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS) in 
fiscal 2015, Responsys, Inc. (Responsys) and Tekele c Global, Inc. (Tekelec) in fiscal 2014, and Acme P acket, Inc. (Acme Packet) in fiscal 2013, 
among others. We believe our acquisition program st rengthens our competitive position, enhances the pr oducts and services that we can offer to 
customers, expands our customer base, provides grea ter scale to accelerate innovation, grows our reven ues and earnings and increases 
stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire  companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. 
Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement s included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides  additional information related to our 
recent acquisitions.  
We believe we can fund our future acquisitions with  our internally available cash, cash equivalents an d marketable securities, cash generated 
from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential 
acquisition with regard to earnings, operating marg in, cash flow and return on invested capital target s before deciding to move forward with an 
acquisition.  
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounti ng principles (GAAP) as set forth in the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accou nting Standards Codification (ASC) and we consider the various staff accounting 
bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by t he United States Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC). GAAP, as set forth within the 
ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgmen ts and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which 
we rely are reasonable based upon information avail able to us at the time that these  
   
42    •   consulting services that are designed to help our c ustomers and global system integrator partners more  successfully architect and deploy 
our products, including IT strategy alignment, ente rprise architecture planning and design, initial pr oduct implementation and 
integration, and ongoing product enhancements and u pgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery mode l to optimize value for our 
customers and partners, consisting of on-premises c onsultants from local geographies, industry special ists and consultants from our 
global delivery and solution centers;  
  •   advanced customer support services, which are provi ded on-premises and remotely to our customers to en able increased performance 
and higher availability of their Oracle products an d services; and  
  •   education services for Oracle products and services , including training and certification programs tha t are offered to customers, partners 
and employees through a variety of formats, includi ng instructor-led classes at our education centers,  live virtual training, self-paced 
online training, private events and custom training .

estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. Thes e estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect t he reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities as of the date of the financial stateme nts as well as the reported amounts of revenues and  expenses during the periods presented. To the 
extent there are differences between these estimate s, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our  financial statements will be affected. The 
accounting policies that reflect our more significa nt estimates, judgments and assumptions and which w e believe are the most critical to aid in 
fully understanding and evaluating our reported fin ancial results include the following:  
   
   
   
   
   
   
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a partic ular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP a nd does not require management’s 
judgment in its application. There are also areas i n which management ’s judgment in selecting among available alternative s would not produce a 
materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and r elated disclosures with the Finance and 
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  
Revenue Recognition  
Our sources of revenues include: (1) software and c loud revenues, including new software licenses reve nues earned from granting licenses to use 
our software products and industry specific softwar e; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees  for granting customers access to a 
broad range of our software and related support off erings on a subscription basis in a secure, standar ds-based cloud computing environment; 
cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deploym ent and management offerings for our software and h ardware and related IT infrastructure 
generally on a subscription basis; and software lic ense updates and product support revenues (describe d further below); (2) hardware systems 
revenues, which include the sale of hardware system s products including Oracle Engineered Systems, com puter servers, storage products, 
networking and data center fabric products, and ind ustry specific hardware; and hardware systems suppo rt revenues; and (3) services, which 
include software and hardware related services incl uding consulting, advanced customer support and edu cation revenues. Revenues generally are 
recognized net of any taxes collected from customer s and subsequently remitted to governmental authori ties.  
Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Softw are Related Services (Software Elements)  
New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use  our database, middleware and 
application software and exclude cloud SaaS and Paa S revenues and revenues derived from software licen se updates, which are included in 
software license updates and product support revenu es. The basis for our new software licenses revenue  recognition is substantially governed by 
the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connectio n with 
the determination of the amount of software and sof tware related services revenues to be recognized in  each accounting period.  
For software license arrangements that do not requi re significant modification or customization of the  underlying software, we recognize new 
software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for t he license of software; (2) we deliver the 
products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinab le and free of contingencies or significant uncerta inties; and (4) collection is probable. 
Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sal e because the foregoing conditions are not met, are  recognized when those conditions are 
subsequently met.  
Substantially all of our software license arrangeme nts do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of 
public policy, for example, in agreements with gove rnment entities where  
   
43    •   Revenue Recognition  
  •   Business Combinations  
  •   Goodwill and Intangible Assets —Impairment Assessments  
  •   Accounting for Income Taxes  
  •   Legal and Other Contingencies  
  •   Stock -Based Compensation  
Table of Contents  
acceptance periods are required by law, or within p reviously executed terms and conditions that are re ferenced in the current agreement and are 
short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenu es upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue 
recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance p rovisions are not perfunctory (for example, accepta nce provisions that are long-term in nature 
or are not included as standard terms of an arrange ment), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or 
expiration of the acceptance period.  
The vast majority of our software license arrangeme nts include software license updates and product su pport contracts, which are entered into at 
the customer’s option and are recognized ratably ov er the term of the arrangement, typically one year.  Software license updates provide 
customers with rights to unspecified software produ ct upgrades, maintenance releases and patches relea sed during the term of the support period. 
Product support includes internet access to technic al content, as well as internet and telephone acces s to technical support personnel. Software 
license updates and product support contracts are g enerally priced as a percentage of the net new soft ware licenses fees. Substantially all of our 
customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.  
Revenue Recognition for Multiple -Element Arrangements — Software Products and Software Related Services (So ftware Arrangements)  
We often enter into arrangements with customers tha t purchase both software related products and softw are related services from us at the same 
time, or within close proximity of one another (ref erred to as software related multiple-element arran gements). Such software related multiple-
element arrangements include the sale of our softwa re products, software license updates and product s upport contracts and other software 
related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous de livery of the other elements. For those 
software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the a mount of new software license revenues 
to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the  residual method, if fair value exists for undelive red elements in a multiple-element 
arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered ele ments is deferred with the remaining portion of the  arrangement consideration generally 
recognized upon delivery of the software license. W e allocate the fair value of each element of a soft ware related multiple-element arrangement 
based upon its fair value as determined by our vend or specific objective evidence (VSOE— described further below), with any remaining amount  
allocated to the software license.  
Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS O fferings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Syste ms Support and Related Services 
(Nonsoftware Elements)  
Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deli verables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offeri ngs, hardware systems products, support 
and related services is based upon the accounting g uidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition , Multiple-Element Arrangements, 
and we exercise judgment and use estimates in conne ction with the determination of the amount of cloud  SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, 
hardware systems products revenues, support and rel ated services revenues to be recognized in each acc ounting period.  
Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements  are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an  arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the 
products and passage of the title to the buyer occu rs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; an d (4) collection is reasonably assured. 
Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sal e because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are 
subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenu es for estimated returns or certain other incentive  programs where we have the ability to 
sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. W here an arrangement is subject to acceptance criter ia and the acceptance provisions are not 
perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions tha t are long-term in nature or are not included as st andard terms of an arrangement), revenues 
are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of writt en customer acceptance or expiration of the accepta nce period.  
Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide  customers access to certain of our software within  a cloud-based IT environment that we 
manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS a nd PaaS offerings are generally 
recognized ratably over the contract term commencin g with the date the service is made available to cu stomers and all other revenue recognition 
criteria have been satisfied.  
   
44  
Table of Contents  
Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and man agement offerings for our software and hardware and  related IT infrastructure including 
comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT i nfrastructure for a stated term that 
is hosted at our data center facilities, select par tner data centers or physically on-premises at cust omer facilities generally for a term-based fee; 
and virtual machine instances that are subscription -based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage. Revenues for these 
cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratab ly over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers 
and all other revenue recognition criteria have bee n satisfied.  
Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products  represent amounts earned primarily from the sale o f our Oracle Engineered Systems, 
computer servers, storage, networking and industry specific hardware.  
Our hardware systems support offerings generally pr ovide customers with software updates for the softw are components that are essential to the 
functionality of our hardware products and can also  include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware 
systems support contracts are generally priced as a  percentage of the net hardware systems products fe es. Hardware systems support contracts 
are entered into at the customer’s option and are r ecognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year.  
Revenue Recognition for Multiple -Element Arrangements—Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Off erings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware 
Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware A rrangements)  
We enter into arrangements with customers that purc hase both nonsoftware related products and services  from us at the same time, or within 
close proximity of one another (referred to as nons oftware multiple-element arrangements). Each elemen t within a nonsoftware multiple- element 
arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met:  the delivered products or services have 
value to the customer on a standalone basis; and fo r an arrangement that includes a general right of r eturn relative to the delivered products or 
services, delivery or performance of the undelivere d product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider 
a deliverable to have standalone value if the produ ct or service is sold separately by us or another v endor or could be resold by the customer. 
Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the d elivered products. Where the aforementioned 
criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undeliver ed element(s) and treated as a single unit of 
accounting for the purposes of allocation of the ar rangement consideration and revenue recognition. Fo r those units of accounting that include 
more than one deliverable but are treated as a sing le unit of accounting, we generally recognize reven ues over the contractual period of the 
arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractua l term of the cloud software subscription. 
For the purposes of revenue classification of the e lements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the 
respective revenue line items within our consolidat ed statements of operations based on a rational and  consistent methodology utilizing our best 
estimate of relative selling prices of such element s.  
For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a sell ing price hierarchy at the arrangement’s 
inception. The selling price for each element is ba sed upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSO E if available, third party evidence (TPE) 
if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling pric e (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a de scription as to how we determine VSOE, 
TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardw are systems product includes software, we determine  whether the tangible hardware 
systems product and the software work together to d eliver the product’s essential functionality and, i f so, the entire product is treated as a 
nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement cons ideration is allocated to each separate unit of acc ounting for each of the nonsoftware 
deliverables using the relative selling prices of e ach unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue 
recognized for delivered elements to an amount that  is not contingent upon future delivery of addition al products or services or meeting of any 
specified performance conditions.  
When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price f or deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipl e-element arrangements using the price 
charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support an d hardware systems support, based on the 
renewal rates offered to customers. TPE  
   
45  
Table of Contents  
is established by evaluating similar and interchang eable competitor products or services in standalone  arrangements with similarly situated 
customers. If we are unable to determine the sellin g price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we dete rmine ESP for the purposes of allocating 
the arrangement by reviewing historical transaction s, including transactions whereby the deliverable w as sold on a standalone basis and 
considering several other external and internal fac tors including, but not limited to, pricing practic es including discounting, margin objectives, 
competition, contractually stated prices, the geogr aphies in which we offer our products and services,  the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value 
added reseller, government agency and direct end us er, among others) and the stage of the product life cycle. The determination of ESP is made 
through consultation with and approval by our manag ement, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or 
our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategi es evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in t he future, which could result in changes to 
our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result , our future revenue recognition for multiple-eleme nt arrangements could differ materially 
from our results in the current period. Selling pri ces are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequen tly if we experience significant changes in 
our selling prices.  
Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Sof tware and Nonsoftware Elements  
Revenue Recognition for Multiple -Element Arrangements — Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements   
We also enter into multiple-element arrangements th at may include a combination of our various softwar e related and nonsoftware related 
products and services offerings including new softw are licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS 
offerings, hardware systems products, hardware syst ems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such 
arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangeme nt consideration based on the relative selling pric es of the software group of elements as a 
whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then furt her allocate consideration within the software grou p to the respective elements within that 
group following the guidance in ASC 985- 605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the  
elements, we account for each respective element in  the arrangement as described above.  
Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to So ftware and Nonsoftware Elements  
Many of our software arrangements include consultin g implementation services sold separately under con sulting engagement contracts and are 
included as a part of our services business. Consul ting revenues from these arrangements are generally  accounted for separately from new 
software licenses revenues because the arrangements  qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC  985-605. The more significant factors 
considered in determining whether the revenues shou ld be accounted for separately include the nature o f services (i.e., consideration of whether 
the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability  of services from other vendors, timing of 
payments and impact of milestones or acceptance cri teria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are 
generally recognized as the services are performed.  If there is a significant uncertainty about the pr oject completion or receipt of payment for the 
consulting services, revenues are deferred until th e uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate  the proportional performance on contracts 
with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly bas is utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage  of total estimated hours to complete the 
project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to me asure progress towards completion, revenues are rec ognized when we receive final acceptance 
from the customer that the services have been compl eted. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we  accrue for the estimated losses 
immediately using cost estimates that are based upo n an average fully burdened daily rate applicable t o the consulting organization delivering 
the services. The complexity of the estimation proc ess and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the 
application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and r elated expenses reported in our 
consolidated financial statements. A number of inte rnal and external factors can affect our estimates,  including labor rates, utilization and 
efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  
Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangem ents to customers buying other software 
and non-software products and services. We offer th ese advanced support  
   
46  
Table of Contents  
services, both on-premises and remote, to Oracle cu stomers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and 
services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangem ent, revenues from these services are recognized as  the services are performed or ratably 
over the term of the service period, which is gener ally one year or less.  
Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based an d internet-based training in the use of our 
software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education of ferings are delivered.  
If an arrangement contains multiple elements and do es not qualify for separate accounting for the prod uct and service transactions, then new 
software licenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally 
recognized together with the services based on cont ract accounting using either the percentage-of-comp letion or completed-contract method. 
Contract accounting is applied to any bundled softw are and cloud, hardware systems and services arrang ements: (1) that include milestones or 
customer specific acceptance criteria that may affe ct collection of the software license or hardware s ystems product fees; (2) where consulting 
services include significant modification or custom ization of the software or hardware systems product  or are of a specialized nature and 
generally performed only by Oracle; (3) where signi ficant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware 
systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the s oftware license or hardware systems 
product payment is tied to the performance of consu lting services. For the purposes of revenue classif ication of the elements that are accounted 
for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate rev enues to software and nonsoftware elements based on  a rational and consistent methodology 
utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling  price of such elements.  
We also evaluate arrangements with governmental ent ities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination f or convenience” provisions, when such 
provisions are required by law, to determine the pr obability of possible cancellation. We consider mul tiple factors, including the history with the 
customer in similar transactions, the “essential us e” of the software or hardware systems products and  the planning, budgeting and approval 
processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If  we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is 
remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a d etermination cannot be made, revenues are 
recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or appr oval of the applicable funding provision by the gov ernmental entity.  
We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at  the time of sale and recognize revenues if all oth er revenue recognition requirements are 
met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. Ho wever, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. 
Payments that are due within six months are general ly deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such 
arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required crit eria for revenue recognition.  
While most of our arrangements for sales within our  businesses include short-term payment terms, we ha ve a standard practice of providing 
long-term financing to creditworthy customers prima rily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1 989, when our financing division was 
formed, we have established a history of collection , without concessions, on these receivables with pa yment terms that generally extend up to 
five years from the contract date. Provided all oth er revenue recognition criteria have been met, we r ecognize new software licenses revenues 
and hardware systems products revenues for these ar rangements upon delivery, net of any payment discou nts from financing transactions. We 
have generally sold receivables financed through ou r financing division on a non-recourse basis to thi rd party financing institutions within 90 
days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds fro m these sales as cash flows from operating activiti es in our consolidated 
statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing , as we are 
considered to have surrendered control of these fin ancing receivables.  
In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasin g companies for the sale of our hardware systems pr oducts. These leasing companies, in turn, 
lease our products to end-users. The leasing compan ies generally have no recourse to us in the event o f default by the end-user and we recognize 
revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recogni tion criteria have been met.

Our customers include several of our suppliers and,  occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at 
or about the same time that we have sold our produc ts to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions ). Software license agreements or sales 
of hardware systems that occur within a three- month time period from the date we have purchased g oods or services from that same customer are 
reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and d isclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a  customer, we negotiate the purchase 
separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purch ase in cash. We recognize revenues from 
Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recog nition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current 
operations.  
Business Combinations  
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations , in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requir es us to recognize separately from 
goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities as sumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill  as of the acquisition date is measured as the 
excess of consideration transferred over the net of  the acquisition date fair values of the assets acq uired and the liabilities assumed. While we use 
our best estimates and assumptions to accurately va lue assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent 
consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, 
which may be up to one year from the acquisition da te, we record adjustments to the assets acquired an d liabilities assumed with the 
corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusi on of the measurement period or final determination  of the values of assets acquired or 
liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any sub sequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidate d statements of operations.  
Accounting for business combinations requires our m anagement to make significant estimates and assumpt ions, especially at the acquisition 
date, including our estimates for intangible assets , contractual obligations assumed, restructuring li abilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and 
contingent consideration, where applicable. Althoug h we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable 
and appropriate, they are based in part on historic al experience and information obtained from the man agement of the acquired companies and 
are inherently uncertain.  
Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain o f the intangible assets we have acquired include bu t are not limited to:  
   
   
   
   
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur th at may affect the accuracy or validity of such assu mptions, estimates or actual results.  
We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and P aaS (collectively, cloud software subscriptions), s oftware license updates and product 
support, and hardware systems support obligations a ssumed. The estimated fair values of these performa nce obligations are determined utilizing 
a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approac h determines fair value by estimating the costs rel ated to fulfilling the obligations plus a 
normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfil l the obligations are based on the historical direc t costs related to providing the services 
including the correction of any errors in the produ cts acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount 
that we would be required to pay a third party to a ssume the performance obligations. We do not includ e any costs associated with selling efforts 
or research and development or the related fulfillm ent margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the  
   
48    •   future expected cash flows from software license sa les, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, hardware systems product sales, support 
agreements, consulting contracts, other customer co ntracts, acquired developed technologies and patent s;  
  •   expected costs to develop the in- process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the 
projects when completed;  
  •   the acquired company’s brand and competitive positi on, as well as assumptions about the period of time  the acquired brand will 
continue to be used in the combined company ’s product portfolio; and  
  •   discount rates.  
Table of Contents  
acquired entities would have concluded those sellin g efforts on the performance obligations prior to t he acquisition date. We also do not include 
the estimated research and development costs in our  fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the 
time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recogn ize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to cloud S aaS and PaaS contracts in the amounts of 
$12 million, $17 million and $45 million that would  have been otherwise recorded by the acquired busin esses as independent entities in fiscal 
2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We did not recog nize software license updates and product support r evenues related to support contracts in 
the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 mill ion that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent 
entities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectivel y. In addition, we did not recognize hardware syste ms support revenues related to hardware 
systems support contracts that would have otherwise  been recorded by the acquired businesses as indepe ndent entities in the amounts of $4 
million, $11 million and $14 million for fiscal 201 5, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, subst antially all of our customers, including 
customers from acquired companies, renew their soft ware license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for 
renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS,  and hardware systems support contracts. To the ext ent cloud SaaS and PaaS, software 
support or hardware systems support contracts are r enewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full  values of the contracts over their 
respective contractual periods, which are generally  one year in duration.  
In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associa ted with restructuring plans committed to 
by our management. Restructuring costs are typicall y comprised of employee severance costs, costs of c onsolidating duplicate facilities and 
contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by  our management, but may be refined in 
subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or  restructure certain activities of an acquired comp any separately from the business 
combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or di sposal activity is 
recognized and measured at its fair value in our co nsolidated statement of operations in the period in  which the liability is incurred. When 
estimating the fair value of facility restructuring  activities, assumptions are applied regarding esti mated sub-lease payments to be received, 
which can differ materially from actual results. Th is may require us to revise our initial estimates w hich may materially affect our results of 
operations and financial position in the period the  revision is made.  
For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pr e-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition d ate and may extend our review and 
evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies t hroughout the measurement period in order to obtain  sufficient information to assess whether 
we include these contingencies as a part of the fai r value estimates of assets acquired and liabilitie s assumed and, if so, to determine their 
estimated amounts.  
If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of  a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax rela ted) by the end of the measurement 
period, which is generally the case given the natur e of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency 
if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a l iability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can b e 
reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement  period, changes in our estimates of such contingen cies will affect earnings and could have 
a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.  
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax relate d valuation allowances assumed in connection with a  business combination are initially 
estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate  these items quarterly based upon facts and circums tances that existed as of the acquisition 
date with any adjustments to our preliminary estima tes being recorded to goodwill if identified within  the measurement period. Subsequent to 
the measurement period or our final determination o f the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated va lue, whichever comes first, changes to 
these uncertain tax positions and tax related valua tion allowances will affect our provision for incom e taxes in our consolidated statement of 
operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  
Goodwill and Intangible Assets — Impairment Assessments  
We review goodwill for impairment annually and when ever events or changes in circumstances indicate it s carrying value may not be 
recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other . According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qua litative 
assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for  
   
49  
Table of Contents  
impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessmen t, if we determine that the fair value of a 
reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a lik elihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than it s carrying amount, the two step impairment test 
prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed. In the fir st step, we compare the fair value of each reportin g unit to its carrying value. If the fair value 
of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of  the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not 
required to perform further testing. If the carryin g value of the net assets assigned to the reporting  unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting 
unit, then we must perform the second step of the i mpairment test in order to determine the implied fa ir value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If 
the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill e xceeds its implied fair value, then we would record  an impairment loss equal to the difference.  
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit invo lves the use of significant estimates and assumptio ns. These estimates and assumptions include 
revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjuste d discount rates, future economic and 
market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimate s on assumptions we believe to be 
reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actua l future results may differ from those estimates. I n addition, we make certain judgments and 
assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabili ties to determine the carrying values for each of o ur reporting units.  
Based upon our most recent annual goodwill impairme nt review which took place as of March 1, 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss 
related to our hardware systems products reporting unit. We considered several approaches to determine  the fair value of our hardware systems 
reporting unit and concluded the most appropriate t o be the income approach. Based upon the completion  of our annual forecasting process, the 
fair value of our hardware systems products reporti ng unit under the income approach was impacted by l ower forecasted operating results, 
primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and o ur continued investment in research and development  activities. We compared the implied 
fair value of goodwill in our hardware systems prod ucts reporting unit to its carrying value, which re sulted in a $186 million goodwill 
impairment loss, representing the aggregate amount of goodwill in our hardware systems products report ing unit. The aggregate hardware 
systems reporting unit goodwill that was impaired i n fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pil lar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems, Inc., 
GreenBytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems, Inc. Such impa irment loss was recorded to acquisition related and  other expenses in our fiscal 2015 
consolidated statement of operations. We did not re cognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 20 14 or 2013.  
Our most recent annual goodwill impairment review f or our other reporting units, which also took place  on March 1, 2015, did not result in a 
goodwill impairment loss. Other than our consulting  reporting unit, all of our other reporting units h ad fair values that substantially exceeded 
their carrying values. Our consulting reporting uni t had $1.8 billion of goodwill on March 1, 2015, an d experienced revenue and operating 
margin declines in fiscal 2015. As of our most rece nt annual goodwill impairment review, our consultin g reporting unit’s fair value was 16% in 
excess of its carrying value. We estimate that shou ld our consulting reporting unit’s projected margin s and related cash flows unfavorably 
deviate from our projections by 20% or more, our co nsulting reporting unit likely would incur a goodwi ll impairment loss.  
We make judgments about the recoverability of purch ased finite lived intangible assets whenever events  or changes in circumstances indicate 
that an impairment may exist. Each period we evalua te the estimated remaining useful lives of purchase d intangible assets and whether events or 
changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability o f finite lived intangible assets is measured 
by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset t o the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is e xpected to generate. We review indefinite 
lived intangible assets for impairment annually and  whenever events or changes in circumstances indica te the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived int angible assets is measured by comparison of the car rying amount of the asset to its fair value. If 
the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference bet ween the carrying value and the fair value 
of the impaired asset.  
Assumptions and estimates about future values and r emaining useful lives of our intangible and other l ong-lived assets are complex and 
subjective. They can be affected by a variety of fa ctors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such 
as changes in our business strategy and our interna l  
   
50

forecasts. Although we believe the historical assum ptions and estimates we have made are reasonable an d appropriate, different assumptions and 
estimates could materially impact our reported fina ncial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015, 
2014 or 2013.  
Accounting for Income Taxes  
Significant judgment is required in determining our  worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary co urse of a global business, there are many 
transactions and calculations where the ultimate ta x outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties  arise as a consequence of revenue sharing 
and cost reimbursement arrangements among related e ntities, the process of identifying items of revenu es and expenses that qualify for 
preferential tax treatment and segregation of forei gn and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid doub le taxation. Although we believe that our 
estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is  reflected in our historical income tax 
provisions and accruals. Such differences could hav e a material effect on our income tax provision and  net income in the period in which such 
determination is made.  
Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certa in undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S.  taxes have been provided because such 
earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign e arnings to the United States are planned 
based on projected cash flow, working capital and i nvestment needs of our foreign and domestic operati ons. Based on these assumptions, we 
estimate the amount that will be distributed to the  United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on th ese amounts. Material changes in our 
estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings wi ll be distributed to the United States or tax legis lation that limits or restricts the amount of 
undistributed foreign earnings that we consider ind efinitely reinvested outside the United States coul d materially impact our income tax 
provision and effective tax rate.  
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our defer red tax assets to the amount that is more likely th an not to be realized. In order for us to 
realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to  generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisd ictions where the deferred tax assets are 
located. We consider future growth, forecasted earn ings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in  the jurisdictions in which we operate, 
historical earnings, taxable income in prior years,  if carryback is permitted under the law and pruden t and feasible tax planning strategies in 
determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be  able to realize all or part of our net 
deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to  the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which 
we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuatio n allowance related to an acquisition 
within the measurement period. If we later determin e that it is more likely than not that the net defe rred tax assets would be realized, we would 
reverse the applicable portion of the previously pr ovided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earn ings at such time.  
We calculate our current and deferred tax provision  based on estimates and assumptions that could diff er from the actual results reflected in 
income tax returns filed during the subsequent year . Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns 
are filed and the global tax implications are known , which can materially impact our effective tax rat e.  
The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoi ng audits by federal, state and foreign tax authori ties, which often result in proposed 
assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A  description of our accounting policies 
associated with tax related contingencies assumed a s a part of a business combination is provided unde r “Business Combinations” above. For 
those tax related contingencies that are not a part  of a business combination, we account for these un certain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, 
Income Taxes , which contains a two-step approach to recognizing  and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or exp ected to be taken in a tax 
return. The first step is to determine if the weigh t of available evidence indicates that it is more l ikely than not that the tax position will be 
sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second  step is to measure the tax benefit as the 
largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be r ealized upon ultimate settlement. Although we belie ve we have adequately reserved for our 
uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters.  We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax 
positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial ruling s, and refinement of estimates or realization 
of earnings or deductions that differ from  
   
51  
Table of Contents  
our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome  of these matters is different than the amounts rec orded, such differences generally will impact 
our provision for income taxes in the period in whi ch such a determination is made. Our provisions for  income taxes include the impact of 
reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are  considered appropriate and also include the relate d interest and penalties.  
In addition, as a part of our accounting for busine ss combinations, intangible assets are recognized a t fair values and goodwill is measured as the 
excess of consideration transferred over the net es timated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are 
generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period t hat any impairment is recorded. Amortization 
expenses associated with acquired intangible assets  are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our e xisting tax structure; however, deferred 
taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortiz ation expenses as a part of the accounting for busi ness combinations. We have taken into 
account the allocation of these identified intangib les among different taxing jurisdictions, including  those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, 
in establishing the related deferred tax liabilitie s.  
Legal and Other Contingencies  
We are currently involved in various claims and leg al proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our 
potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies a ssumed as a part of a business combination 
is provided under “Business Combinations” above. Fo r legal and other contingencies that are not a part  of a business combination, we accrue a 
liability for an estimated loss if the potential lo ss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered  probable and the amount can be reasonably 
estimated. Significant judgment is required in both  the determination of probability and the determina tion as to whether the amount of an 
exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncert ainties related to these matters, accruals are base d only on the best information available at 
the time the accruals are made. As additional infor mation becomes available, we reassess the potential  liability related to our pending claims and 
litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revis ions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of 
operations and financial position.  
Stock -Based Compensation  
We account for share-based payments to employees, i ncluding grants of service-based employee stock opt ions, service-based restricted stock 
awards, performance-based restricted stock awards ( PSUs) and purchases under employee stock purchase p lans, in accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the ex tent they are compensatory) be recognized in our 
consolidated statements of operations based on thei r fair values and the estimated number of shares we  ultimately expect will vest. For our 
service-based awards, we recognize stock-based comp ensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is 
generally four years. For our PSUs, we recognize st ock-based compensation expense on a straight-line b asis over the service period for each 
separately vesting tranche, as the performance cond itions to evaluate attainment of each tranche for e ach participant are independent of the 
performance conditions for the other tranches.  
We are required to estimate the stock awards that w e ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock- based compensation expense for the effects of 
estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense re cognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical 
experience, actual forfeitures in the future may di ffer. To the extent our actual forfeitures are diff erent than our estimates, we record a true- up for 
the difference in the period that a grantee termina tes or the awards vest and such true-ups could mate rially affect our operating results. 
Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis  whether there have been any significant changes in  facts and circumstances that would affect 
our expected forfeiture rate.  
We estimate the fair values of employee stock optio ns using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Th e fair value of an award is affected by 
our stock price on the date of grant as well as oth er assumptions including the estimated volatility o f our stock price over the term of the awards 
and the estimated period of time that we expect emp loyees to hold their stock options. The risk-free i nterest rate assumption we use is based 
upon U.S. treasury interest rates appropriate for t he expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of publicly traded  
   
52  
Table of Contents  
options in our stock in order to estimate future st ock price trends as we believe that implied volatil ity is more representative of future stock price 
trends than historical volatility. In order to dete rmine the estimated period of time that we expect e mployees to hold their stock options, we have 
used historical rates of employee groups by seniori ty of job classification. Our expected dividend rat e is based upon an annualized dividend yield 
based on the per share dividend declared by our Boa rd of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to 
fair value our stock awards are subjective estimate s and changes to these estimates will cause the fai r values of our stock awards and related 
stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary.  
We issue PSUs to certain key executives. We estimat e the fair values of the PSUs based upon their intr insic values as of the grant dates as the 
vesting conditions and related terms of the PSUs we re communicated to each participating employee as o f their respective grant dates and 
include attainment metrics that are defined, fixed and consistently determined based upon consistent U .S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics and 
that require the employee to render service. The pe rformance conditions of the PSUs affect the number of PSUs that will ultimately vest and be 
issued to the grantee based upon a “target” that is  subject to certain attainment maximums, with the p ossibility that none will vest if applicable 
performance conditions are not met. We update the a mount of stock-based compensation expense, net of f orfeitures, to record as of the end of 
each reporting period based on the expected attainm ent of performance targets, which is subject to cha nge until a final determination is known. 
Changes to the target estimates are reflected in th e amount of stock-based compensation expense that w e recognize for each PSU tranche on a 
cumulative basis during the reporting period in whi ch the target estimates are altered and may cause t he amount of stock-based compensation 
expense that we record for such reporting period to  vary.  
We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compe nsation awards that result in deductions on our inc ome tax returns, based on the amount of 
stock-based compensation recognized and the fair va lues attributable to the vested portion of stock aw ards assumed in connection with a 
business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax ded uction. Because the deferred tax assets we 
record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforemen tioned inputs that affect the fair values of 
our stock awards may also indirectly affect our inc ome tax expense. In addition, differences between t he deferred tax assets recognized for 
financial reporting purposes and the actual tax ded uction reported on our income tax returns are recor ded in additional paid-in capital.  
To the extent we change the terms of our employee s tock-based compensation programs, experience market  volatility in the pricing of our 
common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded options in our stock , refine different assumptions in future 
periods such as forfeiture rates or PSU target perf ormance attainment that differ from our current est imates, or assume stock awards from 
acquired companies that are different in nature tha n our stock award arrangements, among other potenti al impacts, the stock- based compensation 
expense that we record in future periods and the ta x benefits that we realize may differ significantly  from what we have recorded in previous

Impact of Acquisitions  
The comparability of our operating results in fisca l 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of 
MICROS in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and Res ponsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.  
The comparability of our operating results in fisca l 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of 
Responsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Teke lec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Pa cket in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.  
In our discussion of changes in our results of oper ations from fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and  fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, we 
may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquir ed products and services (for the one year period s ubsequent to the acquisition date) to the 
growth in certain of our operating segments’ revenu es where such qualitative discussions would be mean ingful for an understanding of the 
factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide q uantitative disclosures related to such

acquired products and services. The contributions o f our acquisitions to certain of our operating segm ents’ revenues, margins and expenses for 
each of the respective period comparisons generally  are not provided in our discussions, as they eithe r were not separately identifiable due to the 
integration of these businesses and operating segme nts into our existing operations, and/or were insig nificant to our results of operations during 
the periods presented.  
We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquis ition comparisons, as well as any quantified amount s themselves, may provide indications of 
general trends, any acquisition information that we  provide has inherent limitations for the following  reasons:  
   
   
Constant Currency Presentation  
Our international operations have provided and will  continue to provide a significant portion of our t otal revenues and expenses. As a result, total 
revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major interna tional currencies. In order to provide a 
framework for assessing how our underlying business es performed excluding the effects of foreign curre ncy fluctuations, we compare the 
percent change in the results from one period to an other period in this Annual Report using constant c urrency disclosure. To present this 
information, current and comparative prior period r esults for entities reporting in currencies other t han U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. 
Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates  in effect on May 31, 2014, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual 
exchange rates in effect during the respective peri ods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros h ad revenues of 1.0 million Euros from 
products sold on May 31, 2015 and 2014, our financi al statements would reflect reported revenues of $1 .08 million in fiscal 2015 (using 1.08 as 
the month-end average exchange rate for the period)  and $1.36 million in fiscal 2014 (using 1.36 as th e month-end average exchange rate for the 
period). The constant currency presentation, howeve r, would translate the fiscal 2015 results using th e fiscal 2014 exchange rate and indicate, in 
this example, no change in revenues during the peri od. In each of the tables below, we present the per cent change based on actual, unrounded 
results in reported currency and in constant curren cy.  
   
54    •   any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot  specifically address or quantify the substantial e ffects attributable to changes in 
business strategies, including our sales force inte gration efforts. We believe that if our acquired co mpanies had operated independently 
and sales forces had not been integrated, the relat ive mix of products sold would have been different;  and  
  •   although substantially all of our software license customers, including customers from acquired compan ies, renew their software license 
updates and product support contracts when the cont racts are eligible for renewal and we strive to ren ew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts 
and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts  shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues, so ftware license updates and 
product support deferred revenues, and hardware sys tems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain 
charges (presented below) are not necessarily indic ative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent 
customers do not renew.

Total Revenues and Operating Expenses  
   
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Our results of operations for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were significantly impacted by 
movements in international currencies relative to t he U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 4 percentage points, total operating 
expenses by 3 percentage points and total operating  income by 6 percentage points.  
Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency varia tions of 4 percentage points, our total revenues in creased in fiscal 2015 due to revenue 
increases in our software and cloud and hardware sy stems businesses. The constant currency growth in o ur software and cloud revenues was 
attributable to growth in our software license upda tes and product support revenues, growth in our Saa S, PaaS and IaaS revenues, and revenue 
contributions from our recent acquisitions. The con stant currency growth in our hardware systems busin ess was attributable to growth in our 
hardware systems support revenues, which were prima rily attributable to revenue contributions from our  recent acquisitions. Excluding the 
effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas  contributed 69%, EMEA contributed 28% and Asia Pac ific contributed 3% to the growth in 
our total revenues during fiscal 2015.  
Excluding the effects of favorable currency variati ons of 3 percentage points, our total operating exp enses increased during fiscal 2015 due to 
expense increases across all of our lines of busine ss, the largest of which were due to increased sale s and marketing and research and 
development expenses resulting primarily from incre ased headcount, increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expen ses to support the increase in our 
cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, and increased acquisi tion related and other expenses.  
Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign curren cy rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points, our fi scal 2015 operating margin was flat in 
comparison to the prior year, while our operating m argin as a percentage of revenues decreased during fiscal 2015 as our total operating 
expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 :     On a constant currency basis, our total revenue s increased in fiscal 2014 due to increases in our 
software and cloud business revenues and our hardwa re systems business revenues, partially offset by a  decrease in our services business 
revenues. The constant currency revenue growth in o ur

software and cloud business was substantially attri butable to growth in our software license updates a nd product support revenues and, to a lesser 
extent, growth in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The constant currency revenue growth in 
our hardware business was due to an increase in our  hardware systems support revenues due substantiall y to incremental revenues from our 
acquisitions and due to increases in our hardware r evenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Syste ms. On a constant currency basis, the 
Americas contributed 61%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to our total revenues g rowth during fiscal 2014.  
Total constant currency operating expenses increase d during fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase i n sales and marketing and research and 
development expenses resulting from increased headc ount, increased sales-based variable compensation e xpenses due to revenues growth, and 
increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses to support t he increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues. Th ese expense increases in fiscal 2014 
were partially offset by lower constant currency ex penses in fiscal 2014 from our hardware systems sup port and services segments due to 
decreased headcount, lower restructuring expenses, and lower intangible assets amortization. In fiscal  2013, we recognized a $387 million 
acquisition related benefit related to changes in e stimates for contingent consideration payable (refe r to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Ann ual Report for additional information) and a $306 m illion benefit relating to certain litigation 
(refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financia l Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Repo rt for additional information), both of 
which decreased our acquisition related and other e xpenses during this period.  
Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluc tuations, our operating margin increased during fis cal 2014 due to our revenues growth, while 
our operating margin as a percentage of revenues wa s flat.

  In connection with our acquisitions, we have estima ted the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS subs criptions, software support and hardware systems su pport obligations assumed. Due 
to our application of business combination accounti ng rules, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to subscription contracts that wou ld have otherwise been 
recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $12 million, $17 million  and $45 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, res pectively. We also did not 
recognize software license updates and product supp ort revenues related to software support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acqu ired businesses as independent 
entities in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, resp ectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardwar e systems support revenues 
related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts o f $4 million, $11 million and 
$14 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respecti vely.

related to intangible assets were as follows (in mi llions):

  Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional  and certain other employees, stock-based compensat ion expenses, integration related 
professional services, certain business combination  adjustments including certain adjustments after th e measurement period has ended and certain other op erating items, net. Included in 
acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2 015 was a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million (refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements included elsewhere 
in this Annual Report for additional information). Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 and 2013 were benefits of $53 milli on and $306 million, respectively, 
related to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included  elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional inf ormation). Also included in 
acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2 013 were changes in estimates for contingent consid eration payable, which reduced acquisition related and other expenses by $387 
million during fiscal 2013 (refer to Note 2 of Note s to Consolidated Financial Statements included els ewhere in this Annual Report for additional informa tion).  
  The significant majority of restructuring expense s during fiscal 2015 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2015 Oracle  Restructuring Plan (2015 
Restructuring Plan) and our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Rest ructuring Plan (2013 Restructuring Plan). Restructu ring expenses during fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily  related to costs incurred 
pursuant to our 2013 Restructuring Plan. Additional  information regarding certain of our restructuring  plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidat ed Financial Statements included

Software and Cloud Business  
Our software and cloud business consists of our new  software licenses and cloud software subscriptions  segment, our cloud infrastructure as a 
service segment and our software license updates an d product support segment.  
New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscripti ons:     New software licenses revenues represent fees e arned from granting customers 
licenses to use our database and middleware and our  application software products. Cloud software subs criptions include revenues from our 
cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, which grant customer s access to a broad range of our software offerings  on a subscription basis in a secure, 
standards-based, cloud computing environment that i ncludes access, hosting, infrastructure management,  the use of software updates, and 
support. We continue to place significant emphasis,  both domestically and internationally, on direct s ales through our own sales force. We also 
continue to market our products through indirect ch annels. Costs associated with our new software lice nses and cloud software subscriptions 
segment are included in sales and marketing expense s, cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses and amortization of  intangible assets. These costs are 
largely personnel related and include commissions e arned by our sales force for the sale of our softwa re offerings, marketing program costs, the 
cost of providing our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings  and amortization of intangible assets.  
   
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total new 
software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues remained flat during fiscal 2015 as growth  in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and 
contributions from our recent acquisitions were off set by a decline in our new software licenses reven ues. In constant currency, fiscal 2015 
revenue growth in the Americas region was offset by  revenue declines in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regi ons.  
As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjust ments to reduce assumed cloud SaaS and PaaS obligat ions to their estimated fair values at the 
acquisition dates. Due to our application of busine ss combination accounting rules, cloud SaaS and Paa S revenues in the amounts of $12 million, 
$17 million and $45 million that would have

Software License Updates and Product Support:     Software license updates grant customers rights  to unspecified software product upgrades 
and maintenance releases and patches released durin g the support period. Product support includes inte rnet access to technical content as well as 
internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses a ssociated with our software license updates 
and product support line of business include the co st of providing the support services, largely perso nnel related expenses, and the amortization 
of our intangible assets associated with software s upport contracts and customer relationships obtaine d from acquisitions.  
   
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency varia tions of 4 percentage points, software license 
updates and product support revenues increased by 8 % in fiscal 2015 as a result of new software licens es sold with substantially all of these 
customers electing to purchase software support con tracts during the trailing 4-quarter period, the re newal of substantially all of the software 
support customer base eligible for renewal during t he trailing 4-quarter period and incremental revenu es from our recent acquisitions. Excluding 
the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Amer icas contributed 50%, EMEA contributed 36% and Asia  Pacific contributed 14% to the 
increase in software license updates and product su pport revenues during fiscal 2015.  
As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjust ments to reduce assumed software support obligation s to their estimated fair values at the 
acquisition dates. Due to our application of busine ss combination accounting rules, software license u pdates and product support revenues 
related to software support contracts in the amount s of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million that w ould have been otherwise recorded by our 
acquired businesses as independent entities were no t recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respect ively. Historically, substantially all of our 
software license customers, including customers fro m acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are 
eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlyin g support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these 
contracts over the support periods, the substantial  majority of which are one year in duration.

Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency  rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses increased 
during fiscal 2015 due to higher employee related e xpenses and facilities costs associated with increa sed headcount that was primarily 
attributable to our recent acquisitions, and also i ncreased due to higher bad debt expenses. These fis cal 2015 expense increases were partially 
offset by fiscal 2015 expense decreases related to lower statutory obligation expenses in the jurisdic tions in which we operate and lower 
amortization of intangible assets.  
In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment increased d uring fiscal 2015 as our total revenues for

Hardware Systems Business  
Our hardware systems business consists of our hardw are systems products segment and hardware systems s upport segment.  
Hardware Systems Products:     Hardware systems products revenues are primaril y generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered  Systems, 
computer server, storage, networking, workstations and related devices and industry specific hardware products. We market and sell our 
hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent dis tributors and value added resellers. 
Operating expenses associated with our hardware sys tems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses 
for materials and labor used to produce these produ cts by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty 
expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inve ntory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. 
Operating expenses associated with our hardware sys tems products also include sales and marketing expe nses, which are largely personnel 
related and include variable compensation earned by  our sales force for the sales of our hardware prod ucts, and amortization of intangible assets.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total hardware  
systems products revenues were flat in fiscal 2015 in comparison to the prior year as revenues from ou r recently acquired companies, including 
MICROS, and increases in hardware revenues attribut able to our Oracle Engineered Systems products were  offset by reductions in the sales 
volumes of certain of our other hardware product of ferings. On a constant currency basis, revenue incr eases in the Americas region and EMEA 
region were offset by declines in the Asia Pacific region.  
Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fl uctuations of 5 percentage points, total hardware s ystems products expenses decreased in fiscal 
2015 primarily due to lower bad debt expenses and a  reduction in amortization of intangible assets. Th ese fiscal 2015 expense decreases were

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations , total margin and margin as a percentage of revenu es decreased in fiscal 2014 due to a 
decrease in our total revenues and increase in our total expenses for this segment.  
Hardware Systems Support:     Our hardware systems support offerings provide cust omers with software updates for software components  that 
are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product 
repairs, maintenance services and technical support  services. Expenses associated with our hardware sy stems support operating segment include 
the cost of materials used to repair customer produ cts, the cost of providing support services, largel y personnel related expenses, and the 
amortization of our intangible assets primarily ass ociated with hardware systems support contracts and  customer relationships obtained from our 
acquisitions.  
   
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, hardware 
systems support revenues increased in fiscal 2015 p rimarily due to incremental revenues from our recen tly acquired companies, including 
MICROS. The Americas region contributed 42%, EMEA c ontributed 52% and Asia Pacific contributed 6%, to our constant currency growth in 
hardware systems support revenues during fiscal 201 5.  
As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjust ments to reduce assumed hardware systems support ob ligations to their estimated fair values at 
the acquisition dates. Due to our application of bu siness combination accounting rules, hardware syste ms support revenues related to hardware 
systems support contracts in the amounts of $4 mill ion, $11 million and $14 million were not recognize d in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. To the extent these underlying hardwa re systems support contracts are renewed, we will r ecognize the revenues for the full values 
of these contracts over the future support periods.   
In constant currency, total hardware systems suppor t expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due t o reduced service delivery costs due to 
operational initiatives and a decrease in amortizat ion of intangible assets, partially offset by highe r employee related expenses resulting from 
increased headcount from our recent acquisitions, h igher external contractor expenses and higher bad d ebt expenses.  
In constant currency, total hardware systems suppor t margin and margin as a percentage of total revenu es increased in fiscal 2015 due to the 
increase in total revenues and decrease in total ex penses for this operating segment.

Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     Excluding the impacts of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems support revenues 
increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to increment al revenues from our acquisitions. In constant curr ency, hardware systems support revenues 
growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific region was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the EM EA region.  
As described above, the amounts of hardware systems  support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013 were affected by 
business combination accounting rules.  
In constant currency, total hardware systems suppor t expenses decreased in fiscal 2014 primarily due t o a reduction in employee related 
expenses attributable to operational initiatives in cluding decreased headcount and reduced service del ivery costs, partially offset by an increase 
in amortization of intangible assets.  
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations , total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased 
in fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segme nt increased while our total expenses for this segm ent decreased.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     On a constant currency basis, total general and adm inistrative expenses increased during fiscal 2015 
primarily due to higher employee related expenses r esulting from increased headcount and higher profes sional fees.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     On a constant currency basis, total general and adm inistrative expenses decreased during fiscal 2014 
primarily due to lower professional fees and lower variable compensation expenses, partially offset by  slightly increased salaries and benefits 
expenses due to an increase in headcount.  
Amortization of Intangible Assets:  
   
Amortization of intangible assets decreased during fiscal 2015 and 2014, each relative to the respecti ve prior year period, due to a reduction in 
expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. These decreases  were partially offset by additional 
amortization from intangible assets that we acquire d in connection with our acquisitions of MICROS in fiscal 2015 and Responsys in fiscal 
2014, among others. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included elsewhere in this An nual Report has additional information 
regarding our intangible assets and related amortiz ation.  
Acquisition Related and Other Expenses:     Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and cer tain 
other employees, stock-based compensation expenses,  integration related professional services, certain  business combination adjustments 
including certain adjustments after the measurement  period has ended and certain other operating items , net. Stock- based compensation expenses 
included in acquisition related and other expenses result from unvested stock options and restricted s tock-based awards assumed from 
acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon t ermination of the employees pursuant to the origina l terms of those stock options and 
restricted stock-based awards.  
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     On a constant currency basis, acquisition related a nd other expenses increased during fiscal 2015 
primarily due to a $186 million goodwill impairment  loss (refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Fin ancial Statements included elsewhere in 
this Annual Report for additional information) and an increase in certain transitional employee relate d costs, primarily related to our acquisition 
of MICROS. These fiscal 2015 expense increases were  partially offset by a $53 million benefit recorded  in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 
related to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included  elsewhere in this Annual Report for 
additional information).

Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     On a constant currency basis, the increase in o ur acquisition related and other expenses in fiscal  2014 
was primarily due to certain benefits that we recor ded during fiscal 2013, which reduced our expenses during this period. We recorded a net 
benefit of $387 million during fiscal 2013 related to the change in fair value of contingent considera tion payable in connection with an 
acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidat ed Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). 
We also recorded a $306 million benefit in fiscal 2 013 to professional fees and other, net related to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewher e in this Annual Report for additional information) .  
Restructuring Expenses:     Restructuring expenses result from the executio n of management approved restructuring plans that w ere generally 
developed to improve our cost structure and/or oper ations, often in conjunction with our acquisition i ntegration strategies. Restructuring 
expenses consist of employee severance costs and ma y also include charges for duplicate facilities and  other contract termination costs to 
improve our cost structure prospectively. For addit ional information regarding our restructuring plans , see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Ann ual Report.  
   
Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2015 primarily rel ated to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and our 2013 Re structuring Plan. Restructuring expenses 
in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 primarily related to  our 2013 Restructuring Plan. Our management approv ed, committed to and initiated these 
plans in order to restructure and further improve e fficiencies in our operations. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2015 
Restructuring Plan are up to $626 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of 
operations as they are incurred. The total estimate d remaining restructuring costs associated with the  2015 Restructuring Plan were 
approximately $526 million as of May 31, 2015 and t he majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 
2016. Actions pursuant to the 2013 Restructuring Pl an were substantially complete as of May 31, 2015 ( refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Ann ual Report for additional information pertaining to  our 2013 Restructuring Plan). Our 
estimated costs are subject to change in future per iods.  
Interest Expense:  
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Interest expense increased in fiscal 2015 primarily  due to higher average borrowings resulting from 
our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in Ma y 2015 and $10.0 billion of senior notes in July 20 14. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 
2015 was partially offset by a reduction in interes t expense during fiscal 2015 resulting from the mat urity and repayment of $1.5 billion of senior 
notes and the related fixed to variable interest ra te swap agreements in July 2014. See Recent Financi ng Activities below and Note 8 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewher e in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our fiscal 2015 borrowings.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     Interest expense increased in fiscal 2014 prima rily due to higher average borrowings resulting fro m 
our issuance of $3.0 billion and €2.0 billion of se nior notes in July 2013 and our issuance of $5.0 bi llion of senior notes in October 2012, 
partially offset by a reduction in interest expense  resulting from the maturity and repayment of $1.25  billion of senior notes in April 2013.

Non -Operating Income (Expense), net:     Non-operating income (expense), net consists pr imarily of interest income, net foreign currency 
exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interes ts in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidi aries (primarily Oracle Financial Services 
Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other in come (losses) including net realized gains and loss es related to all of our investments and net 
unrealized gains and losses related to the small po rtion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.  
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:      On a constant currency basis, our non-operatin g income, net in fiscal 2015 increased due to lower  net 
foreign currency losses and due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances. 
Included in foreign currency losses, net in fiscal 2015 was a remeasurement loss of $23 million relate d to our Venezuelan subsidiary. We 
recorded non-operating expense, net in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a foreign currency remeasurement l oss of $213 million that also related to 
our Venezuelan subsidiary. Note 1 of Notes to Conso lidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report contains additional 
information regarding the foreign currency remeasur ement losses we incurred in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2 013 related to our Venezuelan 
subsidiary.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     We recorded non-operating expense, net in fisca l 2014 in comparison to non-operating income, net i n

remeasurement losses of $213 million that related t o our Venezuelan subsidiary (see Note 1 of Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements 
included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additi onal information).  
Provision for Income Taxes:     Our effective tax rate in all periods is the re sult of the mix of income earned in various tax jur isdictions that 
apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provis ion for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax 
rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefi nitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxe s, the U.S. research and development tax 
credit and the U.S. domestic production activity de duction. Future effective tax rates could be advers ely affected if earnings are lower than 
anticipated in countries where we have lower statut ory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws a nd regulations or by adverse rulings in tax 
related litigation.  
   
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015 increased , relative to the provision for income taxes in fis cal 
2014, due in substantial part to an unfavorable cha nge in the jurisdictional mix of our fiscal 2015 ea rnings, and due to the effects of acquisition 
related settlements with tax authorities in fiscal 2014 that were not present in fiscal 2015, which to gether were partially offset by lower fiscal 
2015 income before provision for income taxes.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014 decre ased, relative to the provision for income taxes in  fiscal 
2013, due to a tax favorable change in the jurisdic tional mix of our fiscal 2014 earnings and the effe cts of acquisition related settlements with tax 
authorities during fiscal 2014.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
Working capital:     The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2 015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was primarily due  to our issuance of 
$20.0 billion of long-term senior notes during fisc al 2015, the favorable impact to our net current as sets resulting from our net income during 
fiscal 2015, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds  from stock option exercises. These working capital  increases were partially offset by $6.2 
billion of net cash used for our acquisitions of MI CROS and others, $8.1 billion of cash used for repu rchases of our common stock, the 
reclassification of $2.0 billion of senior notes du e January 2016 from long-term to current, and $2.3 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our 
stockholders, all of which occurred during fiscal 2 015. Our working capital may be impacted by some or  all of the aforementioned factors in 
future periods, the amounts and timing of which are  variable.  
The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2014 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was primarily due to our issuance of €2.0 billion and $3.0 
billion of long-term senior notes in July 2013, the  favorable impact to our net current assets resulti ng from our net income during fiscal 2014, 
and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock o ption exercises. These working capital increases we re partially offset by the reclassification of 
$1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from lon g-term to current, $9.8 billion of cash used for repu rchases of our common stock, cash used to 
pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used fo r acquisitions.  
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:     Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 
commercial paper and other securities with original  maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securiti es primarily consist of time deposits held at 
major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate not es and certain other securities. The increase in ca sh, cash equivalents and marketable 
securities at May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31,  2014 was due to an increase in cash generated from  our operating activities, our issuance of 
$20.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2015, and t o a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially 
offset by $6.2 billion of net cash paid for our acq uisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of rep urchases of our common stock, the 
repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and $2.3 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to o ur stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and 
marketable securities included $42.7 billion held b y our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2015. We c onsider $38.0 billion of our undistributed 
earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistr ibuted earnings would be subject to U.S. 
income tax if repatriated to the United States. Ass uming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits , the potential deferred tax liability associated 
with these undistributed earnings would be approxim ately $11.8 billion as of May 31, 2015 should the a mounts be repatriated to the United 
States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and ma rketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash 
equivalents and marketable securities balances held  by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translat ion adjustments caused by changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates as of the end of each respe ctive reporting period (the offset to which is subs tantially recorded to accumulated other 
comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance shee ts and is also presented as a line item in our cons olidated statements of comprehensive 
income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). A s the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against ce rtain major international currencies 
during fiscal 2015, the amount of cash, cash equiva lents and marketable securities that we reported in  U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries 
decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2015 relativ e to what we would have reported using constant cur rency rates from our May 31, 2014 
balance sheet date.  
The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities at May 31, 2014 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was due to an increase in cash 
generated from our operating activities, our issuan ce of €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes  in July 2013, and to a lesser extent, cash 
proceeds from stock option exercises. These increas es were partially offset by $9.8 billion of repurch ases of our common stock, $3.5 billion of 
net cash paid for acquisitions and $2.2 billion use d for the payment of cash dividends to our stockhol ders. Additionally, our reported cash, cash 
equivalents and marketable securities balances as o f May 31, 2014 decreased on a net basis in comparis on to May 31, 2013 due to the modest 
strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to c ertain major international currencies during fiscal  2014.

Days sales outstanding, which we calculate by divid ing period end accounts receivable by average daily  sales for the quarter, was 47 days at 
May 31, 2015 compared with 48 days at May 31, 2014.  The days sales outstanding calculation excludes th e impact of revenue adjustments 
resulting from business combinations that reduced o ur acquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, softwa re license updates and product support 
obligations and hardware systems support obligation s to fair value.  
   
Cash flows from operating activities:     Our largest source of operating cash flows is c ash collections from our customers following the 
purchase and renewal of their software license upda tes and product support agreements. Payments from c ustomers for these support agreements 
are generally received near the beginning of the co ntracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over  the course of a fiscal year, we also 
have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS offering s, hardware systems products, hardware 
systems support arrangements, and services. Our pri mary uses of cash from operating activities are for  employee related expenditures, material 
and manufacturing costs related to the production o f our hardware systems products, taxes and leased f acilities.  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Net cash provided by operating activities decre ased in fiscal 2015 in comparison to fiscal 2014 
primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of fo reign currency exchange rate variances on our fisca l 2015 net income of 7 percentage points.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     Net cash provided by operating activities incre ased in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 
primarily due to the following: the fiscal 2013 non -recurring impacts of a $387 million reduction of c ontingent consideration payable in 
connection with an acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included  elsewhere in this Annual Report for 
additional information) and the impact of a $306 mi llion non-current receivable related to certain lit igation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewher e in this Annual Report for additional information) , both of which increased our net income 
in fiscal 2013 without the corresponding operating cash flow benefits. These items did not recur durin g fiscal 2014.  
Cash flows from investing activities:     The changes in cash flows from investing activi ties primarily relate to acquisitions and the timin g of 
purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including 
certain intangible assets, to support our growth.  
Net cash used for investing activities increased in  fiscal 2015 and 2014, each relative to the respect ive prior year period, primarily due to an 
increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash  acquired, and an increase in net cash used to purc hase marketable securities (net of proceeds 
received from sales and maturities).  
Cash flows from financing activities:     The changes in cash flows from financing activi ties primarily relate to borrowings and repayments 
related to our debt instruments as well as stock re purchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stoc k option exercises.  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014:     Net cash provided by financing activities in fi scal 2015 increased in comparison to net cash used by 
financing activities in fiscal 2014 primarily due t o a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2015 (we i ssued $20.0 billion of senior notes during 
fiscal 2015 in comparison to €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2014) as well  as lower stock repurchase activity during 
fiscal 2015. These favorable impacts to our financi ng cash flows during fiscal 2015 were partially off set by the repayment of $1.5 billion of 
borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities duri ng fiscal 2015 (no repayments during fiscal 2014).  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013:     Net cash used for financing activities in fisca l 2014 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2013 prima rily 
due to the repayment of $3.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain exp ired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 
2013 (no repayments during fiscal 2014), a net incr ease in borrowings during fiscal 2014 (we issued €2 .0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes

2014 in comparison to $5.0 billion of senior notes issued during fiscal 2013), lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2014 and higher 
proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2014. These fiscal 2014 cash favorable variances we re partially offset by an increase in 
payments of cash dividends to stockholders in fisca l 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013.  
Free cash flow:     To supplement our statements of cash flows pres ented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a 
trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows gene rated from our operations. We believe free cash flo w is also useful as one of the bases for 
comparing our performance with our competitors. The  presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not mea nt to be considered in isolation or as 
an alternative to net income as an indicator of our  performance, or as an alternative to cash flows fr om operating activities as a measure of 
liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows:   
   
Long -Term Customer Financing:     We offer certain of our customers the option to acq uire our software products, hardware systems produc ts 
and services offerings through separate long-term p ayment contracts. We generally sell these contracts  that we have financed for our customers 
on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions w ithin 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution.  We record the transfers of amounts due from 
customers to financial institutions as sales of fin ancial assets because we are considered to have sur rendered control of these financial assets. We

Interest Rate Swap Agreements :    In July 2014, we entered into certain interest  rate swap agreements that have the economic effect  of 
modifying the fixed interest obligations associated  with our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes so that the int erest payable on these notes effectively 
became variable based on LIBOR. As of May 31, 2015,  our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes had effective intere st rates of 0.76% and 0.91%, 
respectively, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap 
agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 , Derivatives and Hedging . Additional details regarding our Senior Notes and  related 
interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes  8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statem ents included elsewhere in this Annual 
Report.  
Cash Dividends :    In fiscal 2015, we declared and paid cash divi dends of $0.51 per share that totaled $2.3 billion,  an increase of $0.03 per share 
over the cash dividends declared and paid in fiscal  2014. In June 2015, our Board of Directors declare d a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per 
share of outstanding common stock payable on July 2 9, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close o f business on July 8, 2015. Future 
declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of 
Directors.  
Common Stock Repurchases :    Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On  
September 18, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurc hase program by an additional $13.0 
billion. As of May 31, 2015, approximately $9.2 bil lion remained available for stock repurchases under  the stock repurchase program. We 
repurchased 193.7 million shares for $8.1 billion, 280.4 million shares for $9.8 billion, and 346.1 mi llion shares for $11.0 billion in fiscal 2015, 
2014 and 2013, respectively. Our stock repurchase a uthorization does not have an expiration date and t he pace of our repurchase activity will 
depend on factors such as our working capital needs , our cash requirements for acquisitions and divide nd payments, our debt repayment 
obligations (described further below), our stock pr ice and economic and market conditions. Our stock r epurchases may be effected from time to 
time through open market purchases or pursuant to a  Rule 10b5- 1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be acceler ated, suspended, delayed or 
discontinued at any time.  
Contractual Obligations:     The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments un der fixed 
contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in  our business needs, cancellation provisions, chang ing interest rates and other factors may 
result in actual payments differing from these esti mates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the ti ming and amounts of payments. We have 
presented below a summary of the most significant a ssumptions used in preparing this information withi n the context of our consolidated 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our  contractual obligations as of May 31, 2015:

Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report  for additional information related to our notes pa yable.  
     We have entered into certain interest rate swap agr eements related to our 2.375% senior notes due Janu ary 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our 2019 Notes and o ur 2021 Notes that have the 
economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obl igations associated with these senior notes so that  the interest obligations effectively became variab le pursuant to a LIBOR-based 
index. Interest payments on the January 2019 Notes,  2019 Notes and 2021 Notes presented in the contrac tual obligations table above have been estimated us ing interest rates of 0.93%, 
0.76% and 0.91%, respectively, which represented ou r effective interest rates for these senior notes a s of May 31, 2015 after consideration of these fixe d to variable interest rate swap 
agreements, and are subject to change in future per iods. 
     Our 2017 Notes, our floating rate senior notes  due January 2019 and our 2019 Floating Rate Notes bore interest at a rate of 0.47%, 0.86% and 0.78%, respectively, as of May 31, 2015 
and interest payments on these notes presented in t he contractual obligations table above have been es timated using this rate. (1)

As of May 31, 2015, we had $4.8 billion of gross un recognized income tax benefits, including related i nterest and penalties, recorded on our 
consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations  have been excluded from the table above due to the  uncertainty as to when they might be 
settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estim ate of the period in which the remainder of our unr ecognized income tax benefits will be 
settled or released with the relevant tax authoriti es, although we believe it is reasonably possible t hat certain of these liabilities could be settled 
or released during fiscal 2016.  
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from o perations will be sufficient to meet our 
working capital, capital expenditures and contractu al obligation requirements. In addition, we believe  we could fund any future acquisitions, 
dividend payments and repurchases of common stock o r debt with our internally available cash, cash equ ivalents and marketable securities, cash 
generated from operations, additional borrowings or  from the issuance of additional securities.  
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:     We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangemen ts that have or are reasonably likely to have a cur rent or 
future effect on our financial condition, changes i n financial condition, revenues or expenses, result s of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures 
or capital resources that is material to investors.   
Selected Quarterly Financial Data  
Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income h ave historically been affected by a variety of seas onal factors, including sales force 
incentive compensation plans. In addition, our Euro pean operations generally provide lower revenues in  our first fiscal quarter because of the 
reduced economic activity in Europe during the summ er. These seasonal factors are common in the high t echnology industry. These factors have 
caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding f ourth quarter, which historically has been 
our highest revenue quarter within a particular fis cal year. Similarly, the operating income of our bu siness is affected by seasonal factors in a 
consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, o ur new software licenses and cloud software subscri ptions segment) as certain expenses within 
our cost structure are relatively fixed in the shor t-term. We expect these trends to continue in fisca l 2016.  
   
74       Our 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (Janua ry 2021 Notes) and our 3.125% senior notes due July  2025 (July 2025 Notes) are denominated in Euro. In  connection with the issuance 
of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the econom ic effect of converting our fixed rate, Euro denomi nated debt, including annual 
interest payments and the payment of principal at m aturity, to a fixed rate, U.S. Dollar denominated d ebt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest ra te of 3.53%. Principal and interest 
payments for the January 2021 Notes presented in th e contractual obligations table above were calculat ed based on the terms of the aforementioned cross-c urrency swap agreements. 
Principal and interest payments for the July 2025 N otes presented in the contractual obligations table  above were estimated using foreign currency exchan ge rates as of May 31, 2015. 
  Primarily represents leases of facilities and inc ludes future minimum rent payments for facilities t hat we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring a nd merger integration activities. We 
have approximately $61 million in facility obligati ons, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our c onsolidated balance sheet at 
May 31, 2015.  
  Primarily represents amounts associated with agreem ents that are enforceable, legally binding and spec ify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities t o be purchased; fixed, minimum 
or variable price provisions; and the approximate t iming of the payment. We utilize several external m anufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to 
perform final assembly and testing of finished hard ware products. We also obtain individual hardware c omponents for our products from a variety of indivi dual suppliers based on 
projected demand information. Such purchase commitm ents are based on our forecasted component and manu facturing requirements and typically provide for fu lfillment within agreed 
upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-t imes for the particular part or product and have be en included in the amount presented in the above co ntractual obligations table. 
Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered in to in the ordinary course of 
business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order t o secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a 
meaningful way.  (2)

The following tables set forth selected unaudited q uarterly information for our last eight fiscal quar ters. We believe that all necessary 
adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurri ng adjustments, have been included in the amounts s tated below to present fairly the results 
of such periods when read in conjunction with the c onsolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding.  
   
   
Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards  
Our stock-based compensation program is a key compo nent of the compensation package we provide to attr act and retain certain of our talented 
employees and align their interests with the intere sts of existing stockholders.  
We recognize that stock options and restricted stoc k-based awards dilute existing stockholders and hav e sought to control the number of stock 
options and restricted stock-based awards granted w hile providing competitive compensation packages. C onsistent with these dual goals, our 
cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2012 ha s been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.9% p er year. The potential dilution percentage 
is calculated as the average annualized new stock o ptions or restricted stock-based awards granted and  assumed, net of stock options and 
restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employee s leaving the company, divided by the weighted aver age outstanding shares during the 
calculation period. This maximum potential dilution  will only result if all stock options are exercise d and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of 
the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2015, whic h generally have a 10-year exercise period, less th an 1.0% have exercise prices higher than 
the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has m ore than offset the dilutive effect of our 
stock-based compensation program; however, we may r educe the level of our stock repurchases in the fut ure as we may use our available cash 
for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or rep urchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2015, the maximum potential dilution 
from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of wh en granted and regardless of whether 
vested or unvested and including stock options wher e the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 10.2%.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and I nterest Income Risk  
Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally h eld with large, diverse financial institutions worl dwide with high investment grade credit 
ratings or financial institutions that meet investm ent grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitiga tes credit risk and certain other risks. In 
addition, as of May 31, 2015, substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with app roximately 28% having maturity dates within 
one year and 72% having maturity dates within one t o six years (see a description of our marketable se curities held in Note 3 and Note 4 of 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included  elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). We hold a  
mix of both fixed and floating rate debt securities . Our floating rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio 
associated with the risk of rising interest rates. The fair values of our fixed rate debt securities a re impacted by interest rate movements and if 
interest rates increased by 50 basis points as of M ay 31, 2015, we estimate the change would decrease the fair

Interest Expense Risk  
Interest Expense Risk — Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap Agreements  
Our total borrowings were $42.0 billion as of May 3 1, 2015, consisting of $39.7 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $2.3 billion of floating rate 
borrowings (Floating Rate Notes). During fiscal 201 5, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprise d of $1.75 billion of floating rate notes 
and $18.25 billion of fixed rate notes as described  in the “Recent Financing Activities” section of Ma nagement’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item  7) in this Annual Report.  
In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate  swap agreements that have the economic effect of m odifying the fixed interest obligations 
associated with our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior no tes due October 2019 (2019 Notes) and our $1.5 bill ion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 
(2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 20 19 Notes and the 2021 Notes effectively became vari able based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we 
entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixe d interest obligations associated with our 
$1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 201 9 (January 2019 Notes) so that the interest payable  on the January 2019 Notes effectively 
became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the crit ical terms of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes 
and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate s wap agreements pertain to, including the notional a mounts and maturity dates. We do not use 
these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We are accoun ting for these interest rate swap 
agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 , Derivatives and Hedging . The total fair value gain of these fixed to varia ble interest rate 
swap agreements as of May 31, 2015 was $74 million.  If LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bas is points as of May 31, 2015, the 
change would decrease the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $221 million. Additi onal details regarding our senior notes 
and related interest rate swap agreements are inclu ded in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Fina ncial Statements included elsewhere in 
this Annual Report.  
By issuing the Floating Rate Notes and entering int o the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangement s, we have assumed risks associated with 
variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. As of May  31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate assoc iated with our Floating Rate Notes and 
January 2019 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, afte r considering the effects of the aforementioned int erest rate swap arrangements, was 
0.79%. Changes in the overall level of interest rat es affect the interest expense that we recognize in  our statements of operations. An interest rate 
risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure intere st rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash  flows as a result of assumed changes in 
market interest rates. As of May 31, 2015, if LIBOR -based interest rates increased by 100 basis points , the change would increase our interest 
expense annually by approximately $73 million as it  relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swa p agreements and floating rate borrowings.

In July 2014, our 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 for $1.5 billion matured and were repaid, and we se ttled the fixed to variable interest rate 
swap agreements associated with such fixed rate sen ior notes.  
Currency Risk  
Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Risks — Foreign Currency Borrowings and Related Hedges  
In July 2013, we issued €1.25 billion of 2.25% note s due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and we ente red into certain cross-currency swap 
agreements to manage the related foreign exchange r isk by effectively converting the fixed-rate Euro d enominated debt, including the annual 
interest payments and the payment of principal at m aturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated d ebt. The economic effect of the swap 
agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the Janu ary 2021 Notes by fixing the principal 
amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion wi th an annual interest rate of 3.53%. The critical t erms of the cross-currency swap agreements 
match the critical terms of January 2021 Notes, inc luding the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these cross-currency swap 
arrangements for trading purposes. We are accountin g for these interest rate swap agreements as cash f low hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The fair 
values of these cross-currency swap agreements as o f May 31, 2015 and 2014 were a $(244) million loss and a $74 million gain, respectively. 
The changes in the fair values of the cross-currenc y swap agreements during fiscal 2015 were primarily  attributable to the decline in the value of 
the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. If the Euro w eakened by 10% as of May 31, 2015, we estimate the change would decrease the fair values of 
the cross-currency swap agreements by $174 million.  If interest rates that correspond to the remaining  term of the January 2021 Notes decreased 
by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2015, we estimate  the change would decrease the fair values of the c ross-currency swap agreements by $91 
million. Additional details regarding our senior no tes and related cross-currency swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewher e in this Annual Report.  
In July 2013, we also issued € 750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Not es). We designated the 2025 Notes as a net investme nt hedge 
of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in 
stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency ex change rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. D ollar. As a result, the change 
in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency excha nge rates on the effective portion is 
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on  our consolidated balance sheet and is also present ed as a line item in our consolidated 
statements of comprehensive income included elsewhe re in this Annual Report and totaled $208 million o f net other comprehensive gains for 
fiscal 2015. Any remaining change in the carrying v alue of the 2025 Notes representing the ineffective  portion of the net investment hedge is 
recognized in non-operating income (expense), net. We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal  2015.  
Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro  and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S.  Dollars that we will require to settle the 
2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar weakened  by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 201 5, we estimate our obligation to cash 
settle the principal portion of the 2025 Notes in U .S. Dollars would increase by approximately $81 mil lion.  
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk — Foreign Currency Forward Contracts  
We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utili zes foreign currency forward contracts to 
offset the risks associated with the effects of cer tain foreign currency exposures. Under this program , our strategy is to enter into foreign 
currency forward contracts so that increases or dec reases in our foreign currency exposures are offset  by gains or losses on the foreign currency 
forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks an d volatility associated with our foreign currency t ransactions. We may suspend this program 
from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures t ypically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, i ntercompany loans and other 
intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency for ward contracts are generally short-term in duration .  
We neither use these foreign currency forward contr acts for trading purposes nor do we designate these  forward contracts as hedging instruments 
pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fai r values of these contracts as of the end of our re porting period to our consolidated balance 
sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our c onsolidated statement of operations. Given the shor t duration of the forward contracts, the 
amount recorded is  
   
78  
Table of Contents  
not significant. The balance sheet classification f or the fair values of these forward contracts is pr epaid expenses and other current assets for a 
net unrealized gain position and other current liab ilities for a net unrealized loss position. The sta tement of operations classification for changes 
in fair values of these forward contracts is non-op erating income (expense), net for both realized and  unrealized gains and losses.  
We expect that we will continue to realize gains or  losses with respect to our foreign currency exposu res, net of gains or losses from our foreign 
currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized g ain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposu res will generally depend on the size and 
type of cross- currency transactions that we enter into, the curre ncy exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the 
net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency f orward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2 015 and 2014, the notional amounts of the 
forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencie s were $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion, 
respectively. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014, the noti onal amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U .S. Dollars in exchange for other major 
international currencies were $1.2 billion and $2.0  billion, respectively. The fair values of our outs tanding foreign currency forward contracts 
were nominal at May 31, 2015 and 2014. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operati ng income (expense), net in the 
accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $157 million, $375 million and $162 million in  fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and  fiscal 2013 were foreign currency 
remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelan sub sidiary’s operations of $23 million, $213 million a nd $64 million, respectively (see Note 1 
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements inclu ded elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). As a large portion of our 
consolidated operations are international, we could  experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of 
which are unknown.  
Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, C ash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  
Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amoun t of total assets and liabilities that we report fo r our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation 
of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable  securities that we report in U.S. Dollars 
for a significant portion of the cash held by these  subsidiaries is subject to translation variance ca used by changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates as of the end of each respective reporting pe riod (the offset to which is substantially recorded  to accumulated other comprehensive loss on 
our consolidated balance sheet and is also presente d as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere 
in this Annual Report).  
As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain inter national currencies as of the end of fiscal 2015, t he amount of cash, cash equivalents and 
marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Doll ars for foreign subsidiaries that hold internationa l currencies as of May 31, 2015 decreased 
relative to what we would have reported using a con stant currency rate as of May 31, 2014. As reported  in our consolidated statements of cash 
flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate chang es on our reported cash and cash equivalents balanc es in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2015, 2014 
and 2013 were decreases of $1.2 billion, $158 milli on and $110 million, respectively. The following ta ble includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar 
equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable  securities denominated in certain major foreign cu rrencies that we held as of May 31, 2015:

If overall foreign currency exchange rates in compa rison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%,  the amount of cash, cash equivalents 
and marketable securities we would report in U.S. D ollars would decrease by approximately $765 million , assuming constant foreign currency 
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ba lances.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures  
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation u nder the supervision and with the 
participation of our Disclosure Committee and our m anagement, including our Principal Executive Office rs and our Principal Financial Officer, 
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of  our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to  Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 
(e). Disclosure controls are procedures that are de signed to ensure that information required to be di sclosed in our reports filed under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Ac t, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is reco rded, processed, summarized and 
reported within the time periods specified by the U .S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that 
such information is accumulated and communicated to  our management, including our Principal Executive Officers and our Principal Financial 
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions r egarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluat ion of disclosure controls includes an 
evaluation of some components of our internal contr ol over financial reporting. We also perform a sepa rate annual evaluation of internal control 
over financial reporting for the purpose of providi ng the management report below.  
The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implem entation of the controls and the effect of 
the controls on the information generated for use i n this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we review ed data 
errors or control problems identified and sought to  confirm that appropriate corrective actions, inclu ding process improvements, were being 
undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on  a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of manag ement, including our Principal Executive 
Officers and our Principal Financial Officer, conce rning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on 
Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an on going basis by both our internal audit 
and finance organizations. The overall goals of the se various evaluation activities are to monitor our  disclosure controls and to modify them as 
necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure con trols as dynamic processes and procedures that we a djust as circumstances merit.  
Based on our management’s evaluation (with the part icipation of our Principal Executive Officers and o ur Principal Financial Officer), as of the 
end of the period covered by this report, our Princ ipal Executive Officers and our Principal Financial  Officer have concluded that our disclosure 
controls and procedures were effective.  
Management ’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report ing  
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financia l reporting, as such term is defined in 
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under t he supervision and with the participation of our ma nagement, including our Principal 
Executive Officers and our Principal Financial Offi cer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectivenes s of our internal control over financial 
reporting as of May 31, 2015 based on the guideline s established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ’s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financ ial reporting includes policies and 
procedures that provide reasonable assurance regard ing the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles.  
   
80  
Table of Contents  
Based on the results of our evaluation, our managem ent concluded that our internal control over financ ial reporting was effective as of May 31, 
2015. We reviewed the results of management’s asses sment with our Finance and Audit Committee.  
The effectiveness of our internal control over fina ncial reporting as of May 31, 2015 has been audited  by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent 
registered public accounting firm, as stated in the ir report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.  
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reportin g  
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with t he evaluation required by paragraph (d) of 
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred d uring our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially affect, our internal control over financ ial reporting.  
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  
Our management, including our Principal Executive O fficers and our Principal Financial Officer, believ es that our disclosure controls and 
procedures and internal control over financial repo rting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are 
effective at the reasonable assurance level. Howeve r, our management does not expect that our disclosu re controls and procedures or our internal 
control over financial reporting will prevent all e rrors and all fraud. A control system, no matter ho w well conceived and operated, can provide 
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the o bjectives of the control system are met. Further, t he design of a control system must reflect the 
fact that there are resource constraints and the be nefits of controls must be considered relative to t heir costs. Because of the inherent limitations 
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls c an provide absolute assurance that all control issu es and instances of fraud, if any, have been 
detected. These inherent limitations include the re alities that judgments in decision making can be fa ulty and that breakdowns can occur because 
of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, control s can be circumvented by the individual acts of som e persons, by collusion of two or more 
people or by management override of the controls. T he design of any system of controls also is based i n part upon certain assumptions about the 
likelihood of future events and there can be no ass urance that any design will succeed in achieving it s stated goals under all potential future 
conditions; over time, controls may become inadequa te because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or 
procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent  limitations in a cost effective control system, mi sstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle C orporation  
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balan ce sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related 
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensiv e income, equity, and cash flows for each of the th ree years in the period ended May 31, 
2015. Our audits also included the financial statem ent schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. T hese financial statements and schedule are 
the responsibility of the Company’ s management. Our responsibility is to express an o pinion on these financial statements and schedule b ased on 
our audits.  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the stan dards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Bo ard (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai n reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a tes t basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclo sures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles u sed and significant estimates made by management, a s well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
In our opinion, the financial statements referred t o above present fairly, in all material respects, t he consolidated financial position of Oracle 
Corporation at May 31, 2015 and 2014, and the conso lidated results of its operations and its cash flow s for each of the three years in the period 
ended May 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. general ly accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opi nion, the related financial statement 
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fai rly in all material respects the information 
set forth therein.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standa rds of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boar d (United States), Oracle 
Corporation’s internal control over financial repor ting as of May 31, 2015, based on criteria establis hed in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framewo rk) and our report dated June 25,

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle C orporation  
We have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal contr ol over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015, bas ed on criteria established in Internal 
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committe e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commi ssion (2013 framework) (the 
COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal cont rol over financial reporting, and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control  over financial reporting included in the accompany ing Management’s Report on Internal 
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibilit y is to express an opinion on the company’s interna l control over financial reporting based 
on our audit.  
We conducted our audit in accordance with the stand ards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boa rd (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai n reasonable assurance about whether effective inte rnal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit incl uded obtaining an understanding of internal control  over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evalua ting the design and operating effectiveness of inte rnal control based on the assessed risk, and 
performing such other procedures as we considered n ecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.  
A company’s internal control over financial reporti ng is a process designed to provide reasonable assu rance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statemen ts for external purposes in accordance with general ly accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal control over financial reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pe rtain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect th e transactions and dispositions of the assets of th e company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to perm it preparation of financial statements in accordanc e with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of t he company are being made only in accordance with a uthorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonabl e assurance regarding prevention or timely detectio n of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have  a material effect on the financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal contr ol over financial reporting may not prevent or dete ct misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are s ubject to the risk that controls may become inadequ ate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or proce dures may deteriorate.  
In our opinion, Oracle Corporation maintained, in a ll material respects, effective internal control ov er financial reporting as of May 31, 2015, 
based on the COSO criteria.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standa rds of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boar d (United States), the consolidated 
balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated stateme nts of operations, comprehensive 
income, equity, and cash flows for each of the thre e years in the period ended May 31, 2015 of Oracle Corporation and our report dated June 25, 
2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Oracle Corporation develops, manufactures, markets,  sells, hosts and supports database and middleware software, application software, cloud 
infrastructure, hardware systems—including Oracle E ngineered Systems, computer server, storage, networ king and industry specific hardware 
products—and related services that are engineered t o work together in cloud-based and on-premises info rmation technology (IT) environments. 
We offer our customers the option to purchase our s oftware and hardware systems products and related s ervices to manage their own cloud-
based or on-premises IT environments, or to deploy our comprehensive set of cloud service offerings in cluding Oracle Software as a Service 
(SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastruc ture as a Service (IaaS). Customers that purchase o ur software products may elect to purchase 
software license updates and product support contra cts, which provide our customers with rights to uns pecified product upgrades and 
maintenance releases issued during the support peri od as well as technical support assistance. Custome rs that purchase our hardware products 
may elect to purchase hardware systems support cont racts, which provide customers with software update s for software components that are 
essential to the functionality of our hardware prod ucts, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other soft ware products, and can include product 
repairs, maintenance services, and technical suppor t services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings including consulting 
services, advanced customer support services and ed ucation services.  
Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and w as incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation a nd is the successor to operations 
originally begun in June 1977.  
Basis of Financial Statements  
The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majori ty-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling 
interest positions of certain of our consolidated e ntities are reported as a separate component of con solidated equity from the equity attributable 
to Oracle’s stockholders for all periods presented.  The noncontrolling interests in our net income wer e not significant to our consolidated results 
for the periods presented and therefore have been i ncluded as a component of non-operating income (exp ense), net in our consolidated 
statements of operations. Intercompany transactions  and balances have been eliminated. Certain other p rior year balances have been reclassified 
to conform to the current year presentation. Such r eclassifications did not affect total revenues, ope rating income or net income.  
Acquisition related and other expenses as presented  in our consolidated statements of operations for f iscal 2015 included $186 million related to 
a goodwill impairment loss (refer to Note 7 below f or additional information) and for fiscal 2015 and 2013 included benefits of $53 million and 
$306 million, respectively, related to certain liti gation (refer to Note 18 below for additional infor mation). Further, acquisition related and other 
expenses for fiscal 2013 included a change in fair value of contingent consideration payable, which re sulted in a net benefit of $387 million in 
fiscal 2013 (refer to Note 2 below for additional i nformation).  
In fiscal 2015, we adopted Accounting Standards Upd ate (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying 
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03). In connection with the adoption of A SU 2015-03, we reclassified debt issuance costs 
related to our senior notes from other assets to no tes payable, non-current as a deduction to the carr ying amounts of our senior notes in our 
May 31, 2015 and 2014 consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material  impact on our consolidated financial 
statements.  
In fiscal 2015, we also adopted ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement 
Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraord inary Items , ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Abili ty to

ORACLE CORPORATION  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continu ed)  
May 31, 2015  
   
Use of Estimates  
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounti ng principles (GAAP) as set forth in the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accou nting Standards Codification (ASC) and we consider the various staff accounting 
bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by t he U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). T hese accounting principles require us 
to make certain estimates, judgments and assumption s. We believe that the estimates, judgments and ass umptions upon which we rely are 
reasonable based upon information available to us a t the time that these estimates, judgments and assu mptions are made. These estimates, 
judgments and assumptions can affect the reported a mounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during th e periods presented. To the extent there are differ ences between these estimates, judgments 
or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated  financial statements will be affected. In many cas es, the accounting treatment of a particular 
transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and do es not require management’s judgment in its applica tion. There are also areas in which 
management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially differe nt result.  
Revenue Recognition  
Our sources of revenues include: (1) software and c loud revenues, including new software licenses reve nues earned from granting licenses to use 
our software products and industry specific softwar e; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees  for granting customers access to a 
broad range of our software and related support off erings on a subscription basis in a secure, standar ds-based cloud computing environment; 
cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deploym ent and management offerings for our software and h ardware and related IT infrastructure 
generally on a subscription basis; and software lic ense updates and product support revenues (describe d further below); (2) hardware systems 
revenues, which include the sale of hardware system s products including Oracle Engineered Systems, com puter servers, storage products, 
networking and data center fabric products, and ind ustry specific hardware; and hardware systems suppo rt revenues; and (3) services, which 
include software and hardware related services incl uding consulting, advanced customer support and edu cation revenues. Revenues generally are 
recognized net of any taxes collected from customer s and subsequently remitted to governmental authori ties.  
Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Softw are Related Services (Software Elements)  
New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use  our database, middleware and 
application software and exclude cloud SaaS and Paa S revenues and revenues derived from software licen se updates, which are included in 
software license updates and product support revenu es. The basis for our new software licenses revenue  recognition is substantially governed by 
the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition . We exercise judgment and use estimates in connect ion with 
the determination of the amount of software and sof tware related services revenues to be recognized in  each accounting period.  
For software license arrangements that do not requi re significant modification or customization of the  underlying software, we recognize new 
software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for t he license of software; (2) we deliver the 
products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinab le and free of contingencies or significant uncerta inties; and (4) collection is probable. 
Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sal e because the foregoing conditions are not met, are  recognized when those conditions are 
subsequently met.  
Substantially all of our software license arrangeme nts do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of 
public policy, for example, in agreements with gove rnment entities where acceptance periods are requir ed by law, or within previously executed 
terms and conditions that are referenced in the cur rent agreement and are short-term in nature, we gen erally recognize revenues upon delivery 
provided the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continu ed)  
May 31, 2015  
   
acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other reve nue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptan ce provisions are not perfunctory (for 
example, acceptance provisions that are long-term i n nature or are not included as standard terms of a n arrangement), revenues are recognized 
upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acc eptance or expiration of the acceptance period.  
The vast majority of our software license arrangeme nts include software license updates and product su pport contracts, which are entered into at 
the customer’s option and are recognized ratably ov er the term of the arrangement, typically one year.  Software license updates provide 
customers with rights to unspecified software produ ct upgrades, maintenance releases and patches relea sed during the term of the support period. 
Product support includes internet access to technic al content, as well as internet and telephone acces s to technical support personnel. Software 
license updates and product support contracts are g enerally priced as a percentage of the net new soft ware licenses fees. Substantially all of our 
customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually.  
Revenue Recognition for Multiple -Element Arrangements —Software Products and Software Related Services (So ftware Arrangements)  
We often enter into arrangements with customers tha t purchase both software related products and softw are related services from us at the same 
time, or within close proximity of one another (ref erred to as software related multiple-element arran gements). Such software related multiple-
element arrangements include the sale of our softwa re products, software license updates and product s upport contracts and other software 
related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous de livery of the other elements. For those 
software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the a mount of new software license revenues 
to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the  residual method, if fair value exists for undelive red elements in a multiple-element 
arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered ele ments is deferred with the remaining portion of the  arrangement consideration generally 
recognized upon delivery of the software license. W e allocate the fair value of each element of a soft ware related multiple-element arrangement 
based upon its fair value as determined by our vend or specific objective evidence (VSOE— described further below), with any remaining amount  
allocated to the software license.  
Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS O fferings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Syste ms Support and Related 
Services (Nonsoftware Elements)  
Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deli verables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offeri ngs, hardware systems products, support 
and related services is based upon the accounting g uidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition , Multiple-Element Arrangements, 
and we exercise judgment and use estimates in conne ction with the determination of the amount of cloud  SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, 
hardware systems products revenues, support and rel ated services revenues to be recognized in each acc ounting period.  
Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements  are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an  arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the 
products and passage of the title to the buyer occu rs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; an d (4) collection is reasonably assured. 
Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sal e because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are 
subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenu es for estimated returns or certain other incentive  programs where we have the ability to 
sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. W here an arrangement is subject to acceptance criter ia and the acceptance provisions are not 
perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions tha t are long-term in nature or are not included as st andard terms of an arrangement), revenues 
are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of writt en customer acceptance or expiration of the accepta nce period.  
Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide  customers access to certain of our software within  a cloud-based IT environment that we 
manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS a nd PaaS offerings are generally 
recognized ratably over the contract term commencin g with the date the service is made available to cu stomers and all other revenue recognition 
criteria have been satisfied.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continu ed)  
May 31, 2015  
   
Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and man agement offerings for our software and hardware and  related IT infrastructure including 
comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT i nfrastructure for a stated term that 
is hosted at our data center facilities, select par tner data centers or physically on-premises at cust omer facilities generally for a term-based fee; 
and virtual machine instances that are subscription -based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage. Revenues for these 
cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratab ly over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers 
and all other revenue recognition criteria have bee n satisfied.  
Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products  represent amounts earned primarily from the sale o f our Oracle Engineered Systems, 
computer servers, storage, networking and industry specific hardware.  
Our hardware systems support offerings generally pr ovide customers with software updates for the softw are components that are essential to the 
functionality of our hardware products and can also  include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware 
systems support contracts are generally priced as a  percentage of the net hardware systems products fe es. Hardware systems support contracts 
are entered into at the customer’s option and are r ecognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year.  
Revenue Recognition for Multiple -Element Arrangements —Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Syste ms Products, Hardware 
Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware A rrangements)  
We enter into arrangements with customers that purc hase both nonsoftware related products and services  from us at the same time, or within 
close proximity of one another (referred to as nons oftware multiple-element arrangements). Each elemen t within a nonsoftware multiple- element 
arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met:  the delivered products or services have 
value to the customer on a standalone basis; and fo r an arrangement that includes a general right of r eturn relative to the delivered products or 
services, delivery or performance of the undelivere d product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider 
a deliverable to have standalone value if the produ ct or service is sold separately by us or another v endor or could be resold by the customer. 
Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the d elivered products. Where the aforementioned 
criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undeliver ed element(s) and treated as a single unit of 
accounting for the purposes of allocation of the ar rangement consideration and revenue recognition. Fo r those units of accounting that include 
more than one deliverable but are treated as a sing le unit of accounting, we generally recognize reven ues over the contractual period of the 
arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractua l term of the cloud software subscription. 
For the purposes of revenue classification of the e lements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the 
respective revenue line items within our consolidat ed statements of operations based on a rational and  consistent methodology utilizing our best 
estimate of relative selling prices of such element s.  
For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a sell ing price hierarchy at the arrangement’s 
inception. The selling price for each element is ba sed upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSO E if available, third party evidence (TPE) 
if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling pric e (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a de scription as to how we determine VSOE, 
TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardw are systems product includes software, we determine  whether the tangible hardware 
systems product and the software work together to d eliver the product’s essential functionality and, i f so, the entire product is treated as a 
nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement cons ideration is allocated to each separate unit of acc ounting for each of the nonsoftware 
deliverables using the relative selling prices of e ach unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue 
recognized for delivered elements to an amount that  is not contingent upon future delivery of addition al products or services or meeting of any 
specified performance conditions.  
   
94  
Table of Contents  
ORACLE CORPORATION  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continu ed)  
May 31, 2015  
   
When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price f or deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipl e-element arrangements using the price 
charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support an d hardware systems support, based on the 
renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is establis hed by evaluating similar and interchangeable compe titor products or services in standalone 
arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price becaus e VSOE or TPE does not exist, we 
determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the ar rangement by reviewing historical transactions, inc luding transactions whereby the 
deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and cons idering several other external and internal factors  including, but not limited to, pricing 
practices including discounting, margin objectives,  competition, contractually stated prices, the geog raphies in which we offer our products and 
services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the 
product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made  through consultation with and approval by our mana gement, taking into consideration our 
pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or  our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strateg ies evolve, we may modify our pricing 
practices in the future, which could result in chan ges to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a  result, our future revenue recognition 
for multiple- element arrangements could differ materially from o ur results in the current period. Selling prices ar e analyzed on an annual basis or 
more frequently if we experience significant change s in our selling prices.  
Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Sof tware and Nonsoftware Elements  
Revenue Recognition for Multiple -Element Arrangements —Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements   
We also enter into multiple-element arrangements th at may include a combination of our various softwar e related and nonsoftware related 
products and services offerings including new softw are licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS 
offerings, hardware systems products, hardware syst ems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such 
arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangeme nt consideration based on the relative selling pric es of the software group of elements as a 
whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then furt her allocate consideration within the software grou p to the respective elements within that 
group following the guidance in ASC 985- 605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the  
elements, we account for each respective element in  the arrangement as described above.  
Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to So ftware and Nonsoftware Elements  
Many of our software arrangements include consultin g implementation services sold separately under con sulting engagement contracts and are 
included as a part of our services business. Consul ting revenues from these arrangements are generally  accounted for separately from new 
software licenses revenues because the arrangements  qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC  985-605. The more significant factors 
considered in determining whether the revenues shou ld be accounted for separately include the nature o f services (i.e., consideration of whether 
the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability  of services from other vendors, timing of 
payments and impact of milestones or acceptance cri teria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are 
generally recognized as the services are performed.  If there is a significant uncertainty about the pr oject completion or receipt of payment for the 
consulting services, revenues are deferred until th e uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate  the proportional performance on contracts 
with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly bas is utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage  of total estimated hours to complete the 
project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to me asure progress towards completion, revenues are rec ognized when we receive final acceptance 
from the customer that the services have been compl eted. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we  accrue for the estimated losses 
immediately using cost estimates that are based upo n an average fully

burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting or ganization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors 
relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertaintie s inherent with the application of the proportional  performance method of accounting affects 
the amounts of revenues and related expenses report ed in our consolidated financial statements. A numb er of internal and external factors can 
affect our estimates, including labor rates, utiliz ation and efficiency variances and specification an d testing requirement changes.  
Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangem ents to customers buying other software 
and non-software products and services. We offer th ese advanced support services, both on-premises and  remote, to Oracle customers to enable 
increased performance and higher availability of th eir products and services. Depending upon the natur e of the arrangement, revenues from these 
services are recognized as the services are perform ed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less.  
Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based an d internet-based training in the use of our 
software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education of ferings are delivered.  
If an arrangement contains multiple elements and do es not qualify for separate accounting for the prod uct and service transactions, then new 
software licenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally 
recognized together with the services based on cont ract accounting using either the percentage-of-comp letion or completed-contract method. 
Contract accounting is applied to any bundled softw are and cloud, hardware systems and services arrang ements: (1) that include milestones or 
customer specific acceptance criteria that may affe ct collection of the software license or hardware s ystems product fees; (2) where consulting 
services include significant modification or custom ization of the software or hardware systems product  or are of a specialized nature and 
generally performed only by Oracle; (3) where signi ficant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware 
systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the s oftware license or hardware systems 
product payment is tied to the performance of consu lting services. For the purposes of revenue classif ication of the elements that are accounted 
for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate rev enues to software and nonsoftware elements based on  a rational and consistent methodology 
utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling  price of such elements.  
We also evaluate arrangements with governmental ent ities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination f or convenience” provisions, when such 
provisions are required by law, to determine the pr obability of possible cancellation. We consider mul tiple factors, including the history with the 
customer in similar transactions, the “essential us e” of the software or hardware systems products and  the planning, budgeting and approval 
processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If  we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is 
remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a d etermination cannot be made, revenues are 
recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or appr oval of the applicable funding provision by the gov ernmental entity.  
We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at  the time of sale and recognize revenues if all oth er revenue recognition requirements are 
met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. Ho wever, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. 
Payments that are due within six months are general ly deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such 
arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required crit eria for revenue recognition.  
While most of our arrangements for sales within our  businesses include short-term payment terms, we ha ve a standard practice of providing 
long-term financing to creditworthy customers prima rily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1 989, when our financing division was 
formed, we have established a history of collection , without concessions, on these receivables with pa yment terms that generally extend up to 
five years from the

contract date. Provided all other revenue recogniti on criteria have been met, we recognize new softwar e licenses revenues and hardware systems 
products revenues for these arrangements upon deliv ery, net of any payment discounts from financing tr ansactions. We have generally sold 
receivables financed through our financing division  on a non-recourse basis to third party financing i nstitutions within 90 days of the contracts’ 
dates of execution and we classify the proceeds fro m these sales as cash flows from operating activiti es in our consolidated statements of cash 
flows. We account for the sales of these receivable s as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing , as we are considered to 
have surrendered control of these financing receiva bles. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, $1.8 billi on, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion of our 
financing receivables were sold to financial instit utions, respectively.  
In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasin g companies for the sale of our hardware systems pr oducts. These leasing companies, in turn, 
lease our products to end-users. The leasing compan ies generally have no recourse to us in the event o f default by the end-user and we recognize 
revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recogni tion criteria have been met.  
Our customers include several of our suppliers and,  occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at 
or about the same time that we have sold our produc ts to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions ). Software license agreements or sales 
of hardware systems that occur within a three- month time period from the date we have purchased g oods or services from that same customer are 
reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and d isclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a  customer, we negotiate the purchase 
separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purch ase in cash. We recognize revenues from 
Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recog nition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current 
operations.  
Business Combinations  
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations , in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requir es us to recognize separately from 
goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities as sumed, at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwil l as of the acquisition date is measured as the 
excess of consideration transferred over the net of  the acquisition date fair values of the assets acq uired and the liabilities assumed. While we use 
our best estimates and assumptions to accurately va lue assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent 
consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, 
which may be up to one year from the acquisition da te, we record adjustments to the assets acquired an d liabilities assumed with the 
corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusi on of the measurement period or final determination  of the values of assets acquired or 
liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any sub sequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidate d statements of operations.  
Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs 
pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , and are accounted for separately from the busines s combination. A liability for costs 
associated with an exit or disposal activity is rec ognized and measured at its fair value in our conso lidated statement of operations in the period 
in which the liability is incurred. When estimating  the fair value of facility restructuring activitie s, assumptions are applied regarding estimated 
sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ  materially from actual results. This may require u s to revise our initial estimates which may 
materially affect our results of operations and fin ancial position in the period the revision is made.   
For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pr e-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition d ate and may extend our review and 
evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies t hroughout the measurement period in order to obtain  sufficient information to assess whether 
we include these contingencies as a part of the fai r value estimates of assets acquired and liabilitie s assumed and, if so, to determine their 
estimated amounts.

If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of  a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax rela ted) by the end of the measurement 
period, which is generally the case given the natur e of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency 
if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a l iability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can b e 
reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement  period, changes in our estimates of such contingen cies will affect earnings and could have 
a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.  
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax relate d valuation allowances assumed in connection with a  business combination are initially 
estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate  these items quarterly based upon facts and circums tances that existed as of the acquisition 
date with any adjustments to our preliminary estima tes being recorded to goodwill if identified within  the measurement period. Subsequent to 
the measurement period or our final determination o f the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated va lue, whichever comes first, changes to 
these uncertain tax positions and tax related valua tion allowances will affect our provision for incom e taxes in our consolidated statement of 
operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  
Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities  
In accordance with ASC 320, Investments — Debt and Equity Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instrum ents, we classify 
substantially all of our marketable debt and equity  securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt and equity securities classified as available-
for-sale are reported at fair value, with all unrea lized gains (losses) reflected net of tax in stockh olders’ equity on our consolidated balance 
sheets, and as a line item in our consolidated stat ements of comprehensive income. If we determine tha t an investment has an other than 
temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the i nvestment loss in non-operating income (expense), n et in the accompanying consolidated 
statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our 
marketable debt and equity investments are classifi ed as current based on the nature of the investment s and their availability for use in current 
operations.  
We hold investments in certain non-marketable equit y securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. These 
equity securities are recorded at cost and included  in other assets in the accompanying consolidated b alance sheets. If based on the terms of our 
ownership of these non-marketable securities, we de termine that we exercise significant influence on t he entity to which these non-marketable 
securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC  323, Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures , to account for such investments . 
Our non-marketable securities are subject to period ic impairment reviews.  
Fair Values of Financial Instruments  
We apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we ar e required to measure at fair 
value pursuant to other accounting standards, inclu ding our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial 
instruments.  
The additional disclosures regarding our fair value  measurements are included in Note 4.  
Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  
We record allowances for doubtful accounts based up on a specific review of all significant outstanding  invoices. For those invoices not 
specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at d iffering rates, based upon the age of the receivabl e, the collection history associated with the 
geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a rece ivable and charge it against its recorded 
allowance when we have exhausted our collection eff orts without success.

Concentrations of Risk  
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable 
securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with l arge, diverse financial institutions worldwide 
to reduce the amount of exposure to any single fina ncial institution. Investment policies have been im plemented that limit purchases of 
marketable debt securities to investment grade secu rities. Our derivative contracts are transacted wit h various financial institutions with high 
credit standings. We generally do not require colla teral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by 
credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the  short duration of our payment terms for the signif icant majority of our customer contracts 
and by the diversification of our customer base. No  single customer accounted for 10% or more of our t otal revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 
2013.  
We outsource the design, manufacturing, assembly an d delivery of certain of our hardware products to a  variety of companies, many of which 
are located outside the United States. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reduc ing the number of third party 
manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third party manufacturers build our har dware systems products. The inability of 
these third party manufacturing partners to fulfill  orders for our hardware products could adversely i mpact future operating results of our 
hardware systems business.  
Inventories  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or mark et value. Cost is computed using standard cost, whi ch approximates actual cost, on a first-in, 
first-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories  for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales 
levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nin e months). Inventories in excess of future 
demand are written down and charged to hardware sys tems products expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our 
inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recogniti on, a new, lower-cost basis for that 
inventory is established, and subsequent changes in  facts and circumstances do not result in the resto ration or increase in that newly established 
cost basis.  
Other Receivables  
Other receivables represent value-added tax and sal es tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other 
receivables are included in prepaid expenses and ot her current assets in our consolidated balance shee ts and totaled $817 million and $906 
million at May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
Deferred Sales Commissions  
We defer sales commission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, and recogn ize the related expenses over the non-
cancelable term of the related contracts, which are  typically one to three years. Amortization of defe rred sales commissions is included as a 
component of sales and marketing expense in our con solidated statements of operations.  
Property, Plant and Equipment  
Property, plant and equipment are stated at the low er of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed 
using the straight-line method based on estimated u seful lives of the assets, which range from one to fifty years. Leasehold improvements are 
amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful l ives of the improvements or the lease terms, as app ropriate. Property, plant and equipment are 
periodically reviewed for impairment whenever event s or changes in circumstances indicate that the car rying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable. We did not recognize any significant p roperty impairment charges in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessme nts  
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase pric e in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. 
Intangible assets that are not considered to have a n indefinite useful life are amortized over their u seful lives, which generally range from one to 
ten years. Each period we evaluate the estimated re maining useful lives of purchased intangible assets  and whether events or changes in 
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining p eriods of amortization.  
The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible  assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (a t least annually for goodwill and 
indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be 
recoverable. According to ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other , we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to  test a reporting unit’s 
goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based on our qualitat ive assessment, if we determine that the 
fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to  be less than its carrying amount, the two step 
impairment test will be performed. In the first ste p, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit  to its carrying value. If the fair value of the 
reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the ne t assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not con sidered impaired and we are not required to 
perform further testing. If the carrying value of t he net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceed s the fair value of the reporting unit, then we 
must perform the second step of the impairment test  in order to determine the implied fair value of th e reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying 
value of a reporting unit’ s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the differ ence. During fiscal 
2015, we recognized a $186 million goodwill impairm ent loss (refer to Note 7 below for additional info rmation). We did not recognize any 
goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2014 or 2013.   
Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is  measured by comparison of the carrying amount of t he asset to the future undiscounted cash 
flows the asset is expected to generate. Recoverabi lity of indefinite lived intangible assets is measu red by comparison of the carrying amount of 
the asset to its fair value. If the asset is consid ered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment i s measured as the difference between the 
carrying value and the fair value of the impaired a sset. We did not recognize any intangible asset imp airment charges in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 
2013.  
Derivative Financial Instruments  
During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used derivati ve and non-derivative financial instruments to mana ge foreign currency and interest rate 
risks (see Note 11 below for additional information ). We account for these instruments in accordance w ith ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging 
(ASC 815), which requires that every derivative ins trument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair 
value as of the reporting date. ASC 815 also requir es that changes in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge 
accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e. , the instruments are accounted for as hedges).  
The accounting for changes in the fair value of a d erivative depends on the intended use of the deriva tive and the resulting designation. For a 
derivative instrument designated as a fair value he dge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The loss or gain 
attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized  in earnings with an offset recorded to the item fo r which the risk is being hedged. For a 
derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hed ge, each reporting period we record the change in f air value on the effective portion to 
accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consoli dated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive 
loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact th at is attributable to the risk being hedged. For th e non-derivative financial instrument 
designated as a net investment hedge of our investm ents in certain of our international subsidiaries, the change on account of remeasurement of 
the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in  our consolidated balance sheets.

We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforeme ntioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions, if 
any, are recognized immediately in earnings.  
Legal Contingencies  
We are currently involved in various claims and leg al proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our 
potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies a ssumed as a part of a business combination 
is provided under “Business Combinations” above. Fo r legal and other contingencies that are not a part  of a business combination or related to 
income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimate d loss if the potential loss from any claim or lega l proceeding is considered probable and the 
amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 18 below p rovides additional information regarding certain of  our legal contingencies.  
Shipping and Handling Costs  
Our shipping and handling costs for hardware system s products sales are included in hardware systems p roducts expenses for all periods 
presented.  
Foreign Currency  
We transact business in various foreign currencies.  In general, the functional currency of a foreign o peration is the local country’s currency. 
Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations o utside the United States are translated into U.S. D ollars using weighted average exchange 
rates while assets and liabilities of operations ou tside the United States are translated into U.S. Do llars using exchange rates at the balance sheet 
date. The effects of foreign currency translation a djustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated  balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our 
consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Ne t foreign exchange transaction losses included in n on-operating income (expense), net in 
the accompanying consolidated statements of operati ons were $157 million, $375 million and $162 millio n in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively.  
Stock-Based Compensation  
We account for share-based payments to employees, i ncluding grants of service-based employee stock opt ions, service-based restricted stock 
awards, performance-based restricted stock awards ( PSUs) and purchases under employee stock purchase p lans, in accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the ex tent they are compensatory) be recognized in our 
consolidated statements of operations based on thei r fair values and the estimated number of shares we  ultimately expect will vest. For our 
service-based awards, we recognize stock-based comp ensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is 
generally four years. For our PSUs, we recognize st ock-based compensation expense on a straight-line b asis over the service period for each 
separately vesting tranche, which is generally twel ve months, as the performance conditions to evaluat e attainment of each tranche for each 
participant are independent of the performance cond itions for the other tranches. We update the amount  of stock-based compensation expense, 
net of forfeitures, to record as of the end of each  reporting period based on the expected attainment of performance targets, which is subject to 
change until a final determination is known. Change s to the target estimates are reflected in the amou nt of stock-based compensation expense 
that we recognize for each tranche on a cumulative basis during the reporting period in which the targ et estimates are altered and may cause the 
amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for such reporting period to vary.

We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compe nsation awards that result in deductions on our inc ome tax returns based on the amount of 
stock-based compensation recognized and the fair va lue attributable to the vested portion of stock awa rds assumed in connection with a business 
combination, at the statutory tax rate in the juris diction in which we will receive a tax deduction.  
Advertising  
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Adv ertising expenses, which are included within sales and marketing expenses, were $55 million, 
$79 million and $85 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 an d 2013, respectively.  
Research and Development and Software Development C osts  
All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  
Software development costs required to be capitaliz ed under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed, and under ASC 
350-40, Internal-Use Software, were not material to our consolidated financial sta tements in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
Acquisition Related and Other Expenses  
Acquisition related and other expenses consist of p ersonnel related costs for transitional and certain  other employees, stock-based compensation 
expenses, integration related professional services , certain business combination adjustments includin g adjustments after the measurement period 
has ended and certain other operating items, net. S tock-based compensation included in acquisition rel ated and other expenses result from 
unvested options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accel erated upon termination of the 
employees pursuant to the original terms of those o ptions and restricted stock-based awards.  
   
Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 was a goodwill impairment loss of $ 186 million (refer to Note 7 below for 
additional information). Included in acquisition re lated and other expenses for fiscal 2015 and 2013 w ere benefits of $53 million and $306 
million, respectively, related to certain litigatio n (refer to Note 18 below for additional informatio n). Also included in acquisition related and 
other expenses for fiscal 2013 were changes in esti mates for contingent consideration payable, which r educed acquisition related and other 
expenses by $387 million during fiscal 2013 (refer to Note 2 below for additional information).

Non-Operating Income (Expense), net  
Non -operating income (expense), net consists primarily  of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling 
interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services S oftware Limited and Oracle Japan) and net 
other income (losses), including net realized gains  and losses related to all of our investments and n et unrealized gains and losses related to the 
small portion of our investment portfolio that we c lassify as trading.  
   
Included in foreign currency losses, net for fiscal  2015 were foreign currency remeasurement losses of  $23 million, related to our Venezuelan 
subsidiary due to the continued “highly inflationar y” designation of the Venezuelan economy in accorda nce with ASC 830, Foreign Currency 
Matters ; the introduction of currency exchange legislation  in Venezuela in February 2015 to create a new fore ign exchange mechanism known 
as SIMADI; and the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary pursua nt to the SIMADI rate, which we 
determined, based upon our specific facts and circu mstances, was the most appropriate for the reportin g of our Venezuelan subsidiary’s Bolivar 
based transactions and net monetary assets in U.S. Dollars. We incurred losses related to our Venezuel an subsidiary of $213 million and $64 
million during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, for generally similar reasons.  
Income Taxes  
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expect ed tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the t ax bases of assets and liabilities for financial re porting purposes and amounts recognized for 
income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowanc e to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount o f future tax benefit that is more likely 
than not to be realized.  
A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the  recognition and measurement of uncertain tax posit ions taken or expected to be taken 
in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will 
be sustained in an audit, including resolution of a ny related appeals or litigation processes. The sec ond step is to measure the tax benefit as the 
largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be r ealized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize inte rest and penalties related to uncertain tax 
positions in our provision for income taxes line of  our consolidated statements of operations.  
A description of our accounting policies associated  with tax related contingencies and valuation allow ances assumed as a part of a business 
combination is provided under “Business Combination s” above.

consistent with the acquisition of other software l icenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer 
should account for the arrangement as a service con tract. The new guidance does not change the account ing for a customer’s accounting for 
service contracts. ASU 2015-05 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adop tion permitted using either of two methods: 
(i) prospective to all arrangements entered into or  materially modified after the effective date and r epresent a change in accounting principle; or 
(ii) retrospectively. We are currently evaluating t he impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2015-05 on  our consolidated financial statements.  
Revenue Recognition:     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), to 
supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition g uidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when 
promised goods or services are transferred to custo mers in an amount that reflects the consideration t hat is expected to be received for those 
goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doin g so, it is possible more judgment and 
estimates may be required within the revenue recogn ition process than are required under existing U.S.  GAAP, including identifying 
performance obligations in the contract, estimating  the amount of variable consideration to include in  the transaction price and allocating the 
transaction price to each separate performance obli gation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our firs t quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two 
methods: (i) retrospective application of ASU 2014- 09 to each prior reporting period presented with th e option to elect certain practical 
expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii) r etrospective application of ASU 2014-09 with the cu mulative effect of initially applying 
ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial appli cation and providing certain additional disclosures  as defined per ASU 2014-09. We are 
currently evaluating the impact of our pending adop tion of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial s tatements.  
   
Acquisition of MICROS Systems, Inc.  
On June 22, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Syste ms, Inc. (MICROS), a provider 
of integrated software, hardware and services solut ions to the hospitality and retail industries. On J uly 3, 2014, pursuant to the Merger 
Agreement, we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MICROS at a purchase price 
of $68.00 per share, net to the holder in cash, wit hout interest thereon, based upon the terms and sub ject to the conditions set forth in the Merger 
Agreement. Between September 3, 2014 and September 8, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the tender offer,  we accepted and paid for the 
substantial majority of outstanding shares of MICRO S common stock. On September 8, 2014, we effectuate d the merger of MICROS with and 
into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle pursuant t o the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable Maryland law and MICROS became an 
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. Pursua nt to the merger, shares of MICROS common stock tha t remained outstanding and were not 
acquired by us were converted into, and cancelled i n exchange for, the right to receive $68.00 per sha re in cash. The unvested equity awards to 
acquire MICROS common stock that were outstanding i mmediately prior to the conclusion of the merger we re converted into equity awards 
denominated in shares of Oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We a cquired MICROS to, among other 
things, expand our software and cloud, hardware and  related services offerings for hotels, food and be verage industries, facilities, and retailers. 
We have included the financial results of MICROS in  our consolidated financial statements from the dat e of acquisition.  
Pursuant to our business combinations accounting po licy, we estimated the preliminary fair values of n et tangible and intangible assets acquired 
and the excess of the consideration transferred ove r the aggregate of such fair values was recorded as  goodwill. The preliminary fair values of 
net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based upon preliminary valuations and our esti mates and assumptions are subject to 
change within the measurement period (up to one yea r from the acquisition date). The primary areas tha t remain preliminary relate to the fair 
values of intangible assets acquired, certain tangi ble assets and liabilities acquired, certain legal

fair values of the net assets acquired during the m easurement period. The following table summarizes t he estimated preliminary fair values of net 
assets acquired from MICROS:  
   
We do not expect the goodwill recognized as a part of the MICROS acquisition to be deductible for inco me tax purposes.  
Other Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions  
During fiscal 2015, we acquired certain other compa nies and purchased certain technology and developme nt assets primarily to expand our 
products and services offerings. These acquisitions  were not individually significant. We have include d the financial results of the acquired 
companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates and the res ults from each of these companies were not 
individually material to our consolidated financial  statements. In the aggregate, the total preliminar y purchase price for these acquisitions was 
approximately $1.7 billion, which consisted of appr oximately $1.7 billion in cash and $7 million for t he fair values of stock options and 
restricted stock-based awards assumed. We have prel iminarily recorded $14 million of net tangible asse ts and $388 million of identifiable 
intangible assets, based on their estimated fair va lues, and $1.3 billion of residual goodwill.  
The initial purchase price calculation and related accounting for our acquisitions completed during fi scal 2015 is preliminary. The preliminary 
fair value estimates for the assets acquired and li abilities assumed for our acquisitions completed du ring fiscal 2015 were based upon preliminary 
calculations and valuations and our estimates and a ssumptions for these acquisitions are subject to ch ange as we obtain additional information 
during the respective measurement periods (up to on e year from the respective acquisition dates). The primary areas of those preliminary 
estimates that are not yet finalized relate to cert ain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, ident ifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters an d 
income and non-income based taxes.

The amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash e quivalents and marketable securities approximated t heir fair values at May 31, 2015 and 
2014. We use the specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sal e of our marketable securities classified as 
available-for-sale. Such realized gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. The following table summarizes the 
components of our cash equivalents and marketable s ecurities held, substantially all of which were cla ssified as available-for-sale:  
   
As of May 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 28% and 45%, respectively, of our marketable securities inv estments mature within one year and 
72% and 55%, respectively, mature within one to six  years. Our investment portfolio is subject to mark et risk due to changes in interest rates. As 
described above, we limit purchases of marketable d ebt securities to investment grade securities, whic h have high credit ratings and also limit the 
amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As sta ted in our investment policy, we are averse to prin cipal loss and seek to preserve our invested 
funds by limiting default risk and market risk.  
   
We perform fair value measurements in accordance wi th ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price  that would be received from selling 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orde rly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair 
value measurements for assets and liabilities requi red to be recorded at their fair values, we conside r the principal or most advantageous market 
in which we would transact and consider assumptions  that market participants would use when pricing th e assets or liabilities, such as inherent 
risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperforma nce.  
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that req uires an entity to maximize the use of observable i nputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs when measuring fair value. An asset’s or a l iability’s categorization within the fair value hie rarchy is based upon the lowest level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may  be used to measure fair value:

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  
Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value o n a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest com ponents, consisted of the following (Level 1 
and 2 inputs are defined above):  
   
Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair v alues of our marketable securities that were classi fied as Level 1 in the table above were 
derived from quoted market prices and active market s for these instruments exist. Our valuation techni ques used to measure the fair values of 
Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, w ere derived from the following: non-binding 
market consensus prices that are corroborated by ob servable market data, quoted market prices for simi lar instruments, or pricing models, such 
as discounted cash flow techniques, with all signif icant inputs derived from or corroborated by observ able market data including LIBOR-based 
yield curves, among others.  
Based on the trading prices of our $42.0 billion an d $24.1 billion of borrowings, which consisted of s enior notes that were outstanding as of 
May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the estimated fair values of our borrowings using Level 2 inputs at May 31, 2015 and 2014 were $44.1

  Represents the allocation of goodwill to our operat ing segments upon completion of our intangible asse t valuations.  
  Pursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we recorded goodwill adjustments for the ef fect on goodwill of changes to net assets acquired during the measurement period 
(up to one year from the date of an acquisition). G oodwill adjustments were not significant to our pre viously reported operating results or financial pos ition.  
  During fiscal 2015, we recorded a $186 million go odwill impairment loss to our hardware systems prod ucts reporting unit. We considered several approach es to determine the fair value 
of our hardware systems reporting unit as of March 1, 2015 and concluded the most appropriate to be th e income approach. The fair value of our hardware s ystems products reporting unit 
pursuant to the income approach was impacted by low er forecasted operating results for this reporting unit, primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues  and our continued investment 
in hardware products research and development activ ities. We compared the implied fair value of goodwi ll in our hardware systems products reporting unit to its carrying value, which 
resulted in the $186 million goodwill impairment lo ss and represented the aggregate amount of goodwill  for our hardware systems products reporting unit. The aggregate hardware 
systems reporting unit goodwill that was impaired i n fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pil lar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems, Inc., GreenB ytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems, 
Inc. Such impairment loss was recorded to acquisiti on related and other expenses in our fiscal 2015 co nsolidated statement of operations. We did not reco gnize any goodwill impairment 
losses in fiscal 2014 or 2013.  
  Represents goodwill allocated to our other operat ing segments. The balance as of May 31, 2013 includ ed unallocated goodwill for certain of our acquisit ions that was subsequently 
allocated based upon the finalization of valuations  during fiscal 2014.  (4)

2013 Credit Agreement at any time during the term o f the 2013 Credit Agreement. Interest under the 201 3 Credit Agreement is based on either 
(a) a LIBOR-based formula or (b) the Base Rate form ula, each as set forth in the 2013 Credit Agreement . Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 
2013 Credit Agreement are due on April 20, 2018. No  amounts were outstanding pursuant to the 2013 Cred it Agreement as of May 31, 2015 and 
2014.  
The 2013 Credit Agreement contains certain customar y representations and warranties, covenants and eve nts of default, including the 
requirement that our total net debt to total capita lization ratio not exceed 45% on a consolidated bas is. If any of the events of default occur and 
are not cured within applicable grace periods or wa ived, any unpaid amounts under the 2013 Credit Agre ement may be declared immediately 
due and payable and the 2013 Credit Agreement may b e terminated. We were in compliance with the 2013 C redit Agreement’s covenants as of 
May 31, 2015.  
On May 29, 2012, we borrowed $1.7 billion pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase  Bank, N.A., as initial lender and 
administrative agent; and J.P. Morgan Securities, L LC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2012 Credit Agreement). During fiscal 
2013, we repaid the $1.7 billion and the 2012 Credi t Agreement expired pursuant to its terms.  
   
Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan  
During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, our manag ement approved, committed to and initiated plans to  restructure and further improve 
efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisiti on of MICROS and certain other operational activiti es (2015 Restructuring Plan). The total 
estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2 015 Restructuring Plan are up to $626 million and w ill be recorded to the restructuring expense 
line item within our consolidated statements of ope rations as they are incurred. We recorded $100 mill ion of restructuring expenses in 
connection with the 2015 Restructuring Plan in fisc al 2015 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $526 million through 
the end of fiscal 2016. Any changes to the estimate s of executing the 2015 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations. 
Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, our manage ment approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve 
efficiencies in our operations (2013 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring costs associated with the 2013  Restructuring Plan were recorded to the 
restructuring expense line item within our consolid ated statements of operations as they were incurred . We recorded $119 million, $174 million 
and $325 million of restructuring expenses in conne ction with the 2013 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 20 15, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Actions 
pursuant to the 2013 Restructuring Plan were substa ntially complete as of May 31, 2015.

as the services are performed. Deferred cloud softw are as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (Paa S) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) 
revenues generally result from customer payments ma de in advance for our cloud-based offerings that ar e recognized over the corresponding 
contractual term. Deferred new software licenses re venues typically result from undelivered products o r specified enhancements, customer 
specific acceptance provisions, customer payments m ade in advance for time-based license arrangements and software license transactions that 
cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services.  
In connection with our acquisitions, we have estima ted the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS, sof tware license updates and product support, 
and hardware systems support obligations, among oth ers, assumed from our acquired companies. We genera lly have estimated the fair values of 
these obligations assumed using a cost build-up app roach. The cost build-up approach determines fair v alue by estimating the costs related to 
fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit mar gin. The sum of the costs and operating profit appr oximates, in theory, the amount that we 
would be required to pay a third party to assume th ese acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair  value adjustments recorded for 
obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced t he cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates an d product support and hardware systems 
support deferred revenues balances that we recorded  as liabilities from these acquisitions and also re duced the resulting revenues that we 
recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination pe riods.  
   
Fair Value Hedges — Interest Rate Swap Agreements  
In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate  swap agreements that have the economic effect of m odifying the fixed interest obligations 
associated with our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes so th at the interest payable on these senior notes effec tively became variable based on LIBOR. 
In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate  swap agreements that have the economic effect of m odifying the fixed interest obligations 
associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The 
critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements  match the critical terms of the 2019 Notes, 2021 N otes and the January 2019 Notes that the 
interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including  the notional amounts and maturity dates.  
We have designated the aforementioned interest rate  swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair 
value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. These transaction s are characterized as fair value hedges for financ ial accounting purposes because they 
protect us against changes in the fair values of ce rtain of our fixed rate borrowings due to benchmark  interest rate movements. The changes in 
fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolida ted statements of operations with the 
corresponding amounts included in other assets or o ther non-current liabilities in our consolidated ba lance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) 
attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized  as interest expense in our consolidated statements  of operations with the corresponding 
amount included in notes payable, non-current. The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate  swap agreements for the 2019 Notes, 2021 
Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as in terest expense and are included as a part of cash f lows from operating activities.  
In July 2014, we settled the fixed to variable inte rest rate swap agreements associated with the 2014 Notes. We do not use any interest rate swap 
agreements for trading purposes.  
Cash Flow Hedges — Cross Currency Swap Agreements  
In connection with the issuance of our January 2021  Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap  agreements to manage the related 
foreign currency exchange risk by effectively conve rting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated January 2021  Notes, including the annual interest 
payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The ec onomic effect of the swap agreements 
was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 No tes by fixing the

principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%.  We have designated these cross-currency 
swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments a nd are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pur suant to ASC 815. The critical terms of 
the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to th e January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest  payments being hedged, and the cross-
currency swap agreements mature at the same time as  the January 2021 Notes.  
We used the hypothetical derivative method to measu re the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agr eements. The fair values of these cross-
currency swap agreements are recognized as other as sets or other non-current liabilities in our consol idated balance sheets. The effective 
portions of the changes in fair values of these cro ss-currency swap agreements are reported in accumul ated other comprehensive loss in our 
consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclas sified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-operating income (expense), net 
in the same period that the carrying value of the E uro denominated January 2021 Notes is remeasured an d the interest expense is recognized. The 
ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and los ses on these cross-currency swaps, if any, is recor ded immediately to non-operating income 
(expense), net. We evaluate the effectiveness of ou r cross-currency swap agreements on a quarterly bas is. We did not record any ineffectiveness 
for fiscal 2015 or 2014. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are 
classified as operating activities and the cash flo ws that pertain to the principal balance are classi fied as financing activities.  
We do not use any cross-currency swap agreements fo r trading purposes.  
Net Investment Hedge — Foreign Currency Borrowings  
In July 2013, we designated our July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certai n of our international subsidiaries that use 
the Euro as their functional currency in order to r educe the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused  by the changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar.  
We used the spot method to measure the effectivenes s of our net investment hedge. Under this method, f or each reporting period, the change in 
the carrying value of the Euro denominated July 202 5 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective porti on is reported in accumulated other 
comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance shee t and the remaining change in the carrying value of  the ineffective portion, if any, is 
recognized in non-operating income (expense), net i n our consolidated statements of operations. We eva luate the effectiveness of our net 
investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter.  We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2 015 or 2014.  
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated a s Hedges  
We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utili zes foreign currency forward contracts to 
offset the risks associated with the effects of cer tain foreign currency exposures. Under this program , our strategy is to enter into foreign 
currency forward contracts so that increases or dec reases in our foreign currency exposures are offset  by gains or losses on the foreign currency 
forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks an d volatility associated with our foreign currency t ransactions. We may suspend this program 
from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures t ypically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, i ntercompany loans and other 
intercompany transactions that are generally expect ed to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign  currency forward contracts are generally 
short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of 
cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the cu rrency exchange rates associated with these exposur es and changes in those rates, the net 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposure s and other factors.

We neither use these foreign currency forward contr acts for trading purposes nor do we designate these  forward contracts as hedging instruments 
pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the f air values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated 
balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. The ba lance sheet classification for the fair values 
of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain posi tion and other current liabilities for a net 
unrealized loss position. The statement of operatio ns classification for changes in fair values of the se forward contracts is non-operating income 
(expense), net, for both realized and unrealized ga ins and losses.  
As of May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the noti onal amounts of the forward contracts we held to pu rchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for 
other major international currencies were $2.2 bill ion and $3.6 billion, respectively, and the notiona l amounts of forward contracts we held to 
sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major inter national currencies were $1.2 billion and $2.0 bill ion, respectively. The fair values of our 
outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were  nominal at May 31, 2015 and 2014.  
Included in our non-operating income (expense), net  were $60 million, $(69) million and $(64) million of net gains (losses) related to these 
forward contracts for the years ended May 31, 2015,  2014 and 2013, respectively. The cash flows relate d to these foreign currency contracts are

Lease Commitments  
We lease certain facilities, furniture and equipmen t under operating leases. As of May 31, 2015, futur e minimum annual operating lease 
payments and future minimum payments to be received  from non-cancelable subleases were as follows:  
   
Lease commitments included future minimum rent paym ents for facilities that we have vacated pursuant t o our restructuring and merger 
integration activities, as discussed in Note 9. We have approximately $61 million in facility obligati ons, net of estimated sublease income and 
other costs, in accrued restructuring for these loc ations in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31,  2015.  
Rent expense was $290 million, $278 million and $31 3 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectiv ely, net of sublease income of 
approximately $45 million, $55 million and $69 mill ion, respectively. Certain lease agreements contain  renewal options providing for extensions 
of the lease terms.  
Unconditional Obligations  
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into c ertain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are 
enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, inc luding: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ; fixed, minimum or variable price 
provisions; and the approximate timing of the payme nt. We utilize several external manufacturers to ma nufacture sub-assemblies for our 
hardware products and to perform final assembly and  testing of finished hardware products. We also obt ain individual components for our 
hardware systems products from a variety of individ ual suppliers based on projected demand information . Such purchase commitments are based 
on our forecasted component and manufacturing requi rements and typically provide for fulfillment withi n agreed upon lead-times and/or 
commercially standard lead-times for the particular  part or product and have been included in the amou nts below. Routine arrangements for 
other materials and goods that are not related to o ur external manufacturers and certain other supplie rs and that are entered into in the ordinary 
course of business are not included in the amounts below as they are generally entered into in order t o secure pricing or other negotiated terms 
and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.

As of May 31, 2015, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in milli ons):  
   
As described in Note 8 and Note 11 above, as of May  31, 2015 we have senior notes of $42.0 billion tha t mature at various future dates and 
derivative financial instruments outstanding that w e leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.  
Guarantees  
Our software, cloud and hardware systems product sa les agreements generally include certain provisions  for indemnifying customers against 
liabilities if our products infringe a third party’ s intellectual property rights. To date, we have no t incurred any material costs as a result of such 
indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our cons olidated financial statements. Certain of our 
product sales agreements also include provisions in demnifying customers against liabilities in the eve nt we breach confidentiality or service 
level requirements. It is not possible to determine  the maximum potential amount under these indemnifi cation agreements due to our limited and 
infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  
Our software license and hardware systems products agreements also generally include a warranty that o ur products will substantially operate as 
described in the applicable program documentation f or a period of one year after delivery. Our softwar e as a service, platform as a service and 
infrastructure as a service agreements generally in clude a warranty that the cloud services will be pe rformed in all material respects as defined in 
the agreement during the service period. We also wa rrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry 
standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.  
We occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parti es in the ordinary course of our 
business including, among others, guarantees relate d to foreign exchange trades, taxes, import license s and letters of credit on behalf of parties 
with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have  not had a material effect on our results of operat ions, financial position or cash flows.  
   
Stock Repurchases  
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for u s to repurchase shares of our common stock. On Sept ember 18, 2014, we announced that 
our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our  stock repurchase program by an additional $13.0 bi llion. Approximately $9.2 billion 
remained available for stock repurchases as of May 31, 2015, pursuant to our stock repurchase program.  We repurchased 193.7 million shares 
for $8.1 billion (including 2.2 million shares for $95 million that were repurchased but not settled),  280.4 million shares for $9.8 billion and 
346.1 million shares for $11.0 billion in fiscal 20 15, 2014 and 2013, respectively, under the stock re purchase program.  
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an  expiration date and the pace of our repurchase act ivity will depend on factors such as our 
working capital needs, our cash requirements for ac quisitions and dividend payments, our debt repaymen t obligations or repurchase of our debt, 
our stock price, and economic and market

stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspen ded, delayed or discontinued at any time.  
Dividends on Common Stock  
During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Board of Dir ectors declared cash dividends of $0.51, $0.48 and $0.30 per share of our outstanding 
common stock, respectively, which we paid during th e same period.  
In June 2015, our Board of Directors declared a qua rterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outs tanding common stock payable on July 29, 
2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of b usiness on July 8, 2015. Future declarations of div idends and the establishment of future record 
and payment dates are subject to the final determin ation of our Board of Directors.  
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  
The following table summarizes, as of each balance sheet date, the components of our accumulated other  comprehensive loss, net of income 
taxes:  
   
   
Stock-based Compensation Plans  
Stock Plans  
In fiscal 2001, we adopted the 2000 Long-Term Equit y Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance o f non-qualified stock options and 
incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights, and long-term pe rformance awards, including restricted stock-
based awards, to our eligible employees, officers a nd directors who are also employees or consultants,  independent consultants and advisers. In 
fiscal 2011, our stockholders, upon the recommendat ion of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved  the adoption of the Amended and 
Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by ten years and 
increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares. In fiscal  2014, our stockholders, upon the 
recommendation of our Board, approved a further inc rease in the number of authorized shares of stock t hat may be issued under the 2000 Plan 
by 305,000,000 shares.  
Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, options to purcha se common stock are granted at not less than fair m arket value, become exercisable as 
established by the Compensation Committee of the Bo ard (generally 25% annually over four years under o ur current practice) and generally 
expire no more than ten years from the date of gran t. Long-term full value awards are granted in the f orm of restricted stock units (RSUs) and 
performance stock units (PSUs). The vesting schedul e for RSUs is established by the Compensation Commi ttee and generally requires vesting 
25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs is also established by the Compensation Co mmittee and currently requires vesting 
over four fiscal years, if at all, based on relativ e performance. For each share granted as a full val ue award under the 2000 Plan, an equivalent of 
2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares avai lable for grant. As of May 31, 2015, the 2000 Plan had stock options to purchase 401 million 
shares of common stock outstanding of which 215 mil lion shares were vested, 24 million unvested RSUs o utstanding and

3 million unvested PSUs outstanding. As of May 31, 2015, approximately 409 million shares of common st ock were available for future awards 
under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued an y stock purchase rights or stock appreciation right s under the 2000 Plan.  
In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Director s’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides  for the issuance of non-qualified stock 
options and other stock-based awards, including RSU s, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan h as from time to time been amended and 
restated. Under the terms of the Directors’ Plan, 1 0 million shares of common stock are reserved for i ssuance (including a fiscal 2013 
amendment to increase the number of shares of our c ommon stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shar es). Options are granted at not less than 
fair market value, vest over four years, and expire  no more than ten years from the date of grant. RSU s granted under the Directors’ Plan also 
vest over four years. The Directors’ Plan provides for automatic grants of stock awards to each non-em ployee director upon first becoming a 
director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well  as automatic nondiscretionary grants for chairing or vice chairing certain Board committees. 
The Board will determine the particular terms of an y such stock awards at the time of grant, but the t erms will be consistent with those of stock 
awards granted under the Directors’ Plan with respe ct to vesting or forfeiture schedules and treatment  on termination of status as a director. As 
of May 31, 2015, options to purchase approximately 4 million shares of common stock (of which approxim ately 2 million were vested) and 
64,000 unvested RSUs were outstanding under the 199 3 Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2015, approximatel y 2 million shares were available for 
future stock awards under this plan.  
In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding stock options and other  restricted stock-based awards under each 
acquired company’s respective stock plans. These st ock options and other restricted stock-based awards  generally retain all of the rights, terms 
and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2015, s tock options to purchase 8 million shares 
of common stock and 1 million shares of restricted stock-based awards were outstanding under these pla ns.

Restricted stock-based award activity and the numbe r of restricted stock-based awards outstanding were  not significant prior to fiscal 2015. The 
following table summarizes restricted stock-based a wards activity, including service-based awards and performance-based awards and including 
awards granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans  and stock plans assumed from our acquisitions for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2015:  
   
The total grant date fair value of restricted stock -based awards that vested in fiscal 2015 was $28 mi llion. As of May 31, 2015, total 
unrecognized stock compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock- based awards was $774 million and is expected to be  recognized 
over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 3.22 years.  
In fiscal 2015, 3 million PSUs were granted which v est upon the attainment of certain performance metr ics and service-based vesting. Based 
upon actual attainment relative to the “target” per formance metric, certain participants have the abil ity to be issued up to 150% of the target 
number of PSUs originally granted, or to be issued no PSUs at all. As of May 31, 2015, no PSUs had ves ted and 3 million remained outstanding.

Stock -Based Compensation Expense and Valuation of Stock A wards  
We estimated the fair values of our stock options u sing the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model,  which was developed for use in 
estimating the fair values of stock options. Option  valuation models, including the Black-Scholes-Mert on option- pricing model, require the input 
of assumptions, including stock price volatility. C hanges in the input assumptions can materially affe ct the fair value estimates and ultimately 
how much we recognize as stock-based compensation e xpense. The fair values of our stock options were e stimated at the grant dates or at the 
acquisition dates for options assumed in a business  combination. The weighted average input assumption s used and resulting fair values of our 
stock options were as follows for fiscal 2015, 2014  and 2013:  
   
The expected life input is based on historical exer cise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior , the risk-free interest rate input is based on 
U.S. Treasury instruments, the annualized dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend decl ared by our Board of Directors and the 
volatility input is calculated based on the implied  volatility of our publicly traded options.  
We estimated the fair values of our restricted stoc k-based awards that are solely subject to service-b ased vesting requirements based upon their 
intrinsic values as of the grant dates.  
The fair values of our PSUs were also measured at t heir intrinsic values as of their respective grant dates. The vesting conditions and related 
terms of our PSUs were communicated to each partici pating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that 
were defined, fixed, and based upon consistent U.S.  GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined,  fixed and consistently determined, and 
that require the employee to render service. Theref ore, these awards meet the performance-based award classification criteria as defined within 
ASC 718.  
Stock-based compensation is included in the followi ng operating expense line items in our consolidated  statements of operations:

Tax Benefits from Exercise of Stock Options and Ves ting of Restricted Stock -Based Awards  
Total cash received as a result of option exercises  was approximately $1.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $ 1.4 billion for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of opti ons exercised and vesting of restricted stock-based  awards was $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion and 
$1.3 billion for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respec tively. In connection with these exercises and vest ing of restricted stock-based awards, the tax 
benefits realized by us were $396 million, $480 mil lion and $410 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 201 3, respectively. Of the total tax benefits 
received, we classified excess tax benefits from st ock-based compensation of $244 million, $250 millio n and $241 million as cash flows from 
financing activities rather than cash flows from op erating activities for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  
Employee Stock Purchase Plan  
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase P lan) that allows employees to purchase shares of co mmon stock at a price per share that 
is 95% of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2015, 57 million shares were 
reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Pl an. We issued 3 million shares under the Purchase P lan in each of fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and 
fiscal 2013.  
Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans   
We offer various defined contribution plans for our  U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contrib ution plan expense was $362 million, 
$357 million and $353 million for fiscal 2015, 2014  and 2013, respectively. The number of plan partici pants in our benefit plans has generally 
increased in recent years primarily as a result of additional eligible employees from our acquisitions .  
In the United States, regular employees can partici pate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and I nvestment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). 
Participants can generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period bas is as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan 
document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) . We match a portion of employee 
contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensati on each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate ma tching amounts. Our contributions to 
the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $1 44 million, $134 million and $129 million in fiscal  2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  
We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation p lans to certain key employees whereby they may defe r a portion of their annual base and/or 
variable compensation until retirement or a date sp ecified by the employee in accordance with the plan s. Deferred compensation plan assets and 
liabilities were each approximately $408 million as  of May 31, 2015 and were each approximately $367 m illion as of May 31, 2014 and were 
presented in other assets and other non-current lia bilities in the accompanying consolidated balance s heets.  
We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans th at are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were 
assumed through our acquisitions or are required by  local regulatory requirements. We may deposit fund s for these plans with insurance 
companies, third party trustees, or into government -managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total 
defined benefit plan pension expenses were $69 mill ion, $64 million and $81 million for fiscal 2015, 2 014 and 2013, respectively. The aggregate 
projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liab ility (funded status) of our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2015 was $1.0 billion and $599 
million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2014 was $ 853 million and $436 million, respectively.

The components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets were as follows:  
   
We provide for United States income taxes on the un distributed earnings and the other outside basis te mporary differences of foreign 
subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitel y reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2015, the amount of temporary differences 
related to undistributed earnings and other outside  basis temporary differences of investments in fore ign subsidiaries upon which United States 
income taxes have not been provided was approximate ly $38.0 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. If  these undistributed earnings were 
repatriated to the United States, or if the other o utside basis differences were recognized in a taxab le transaction, they would generate foreign tax 
credits that would reduce the federal tax liability  associated with the foreign dividend or the otherw ise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2015, 
assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax cred its, the potential net deferred tax liability assoc iated with these temporary differences of 
undistributed earnings and other outside basis temp orary differences would be approximately $11.8 bill ion and $2.7 billion, respectively.  
Our net deferred tax assets were $993 million and $ 1.4 billion as of May 31, 2015 and 2014, respective ly. We believe it is more likely than not 
that the net deferred tax assets will be realized i n the foreseeable future. Realization of our net de ferred tax assets is dependent upon our 
generation of sufficient taxable income in future y ears in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain ben efit from the reversal of temporary 
differences, net operating loss carryforwards and t ax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred  tax assets considered realizable is subject 
to adjustment in future periods if estimates of fut ure taxable income change.

The valuation allowance was $1.0 billion and $1.1 b illion at May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Subs tantially all of the valuation allowances 
as of May 31, 2015 and 2014 relate to tax assets es tablished in purchase accounting. Any subsequent re duction of that portion of the valuation 
allowance and the recognition of the associated tax  benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes 
subsequent to our final determination of the valuat ion allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever 
comes first.  
At May 31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $958 million. These losses expire in various years between 
fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2034, and are subject to lim itations on their utilization. We had state net ope rating loss carryforwards of approximately 
$2.9 billion at May 31, 2015, which expire between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2034, and are subject to lim itations on their utilization. We had total 
foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approxi mately $1.6 billion at May 31, 2015, which are subj ect to limitations on their utilization. 
Approximately $1.4 billion of these foreign net ope rating losses are not currently subject to expirati on dates. The remainder of the foreign net 
operating losses, approximately $216 million, expir e between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2035. We had tax c redit carryforwards of approximately 
$904 million at May 31, 2015, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $57 3 million of these tax credit carryforwards 
are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approxim ately $331 million, expire in various years 
between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2034.  
We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either  current or non-current income taxes payable in the  accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets. The aggregate changes in the balance of our  gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisi tions, were as follows:  
   
As of May 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, $2.8 billion, $2 .6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, of unrec ognized benefits would affect our effective 
tax rate if recognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our  provision for income taxes line of our 
consolidated statements of operations of $102 milli on, $24 million and $31 million during fiscal 2015,  2014 and 2013, respectively. Interest and 
penalties accrued as of May 31, 2015 and 2014 were $756 million and $693 million, respectively.  
Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authori ties are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for 
years through fiscal 2013. Many issues are at an ad vanced stage in the examination process, the most s ignificant of which include the 
deductibility of certain royalty payments, transfer  pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domes tic production activity, foreign tax credits, 
and research and development credits taken. Other i ssues are related to years with expiring statutes o f limitation. With all of these domestic audit 
issues considered in the aggregate, we believe it w as reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2015, th e gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
these audits could decrease (whether by payment, re lease, or a combination of both) in the next 12 mon ths by as much as $426 million ($358 
million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. f ederal and, with some exceptions, our state income tax returns have been examined for all years 
prior to fiscal 2003 and we are no longer subject t o audit for those periods.

Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U .S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affect ing our unrecognized tax benefits. We 
believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2015, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, coul d decrease (whether by payment, release, or 
a combination of both) by as much as $172 million ( $86 million net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months, related primarily to transfer 
pricing. Other issues are related to years with exp iring statutes of limitation. With some exceptions,  we are generally no longer subject to tax 
examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years pr ior to fiscal 1997.  
We believe that we have adequately provided under U .S. GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. Ho wever, there can be no assurances as 
to the possible outcomes or any attendant financial  statement effect thereof.  
   
ASC 280, Segment Reporting , establishes standards for reporting information a bout operating segments. Operating segments are def ined as 
components of an enterprise about which separate fi nancial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision 
maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to  allocate resources and in assessing performance. O ur chief operating decision makers are 
our Chief Executive Officers. We are organized geog raphically and by line of business. While our Chief  Executive Officers evaluate results in a 
number of different ways, the line of business mana gement structure is the primary basis for which the  allocation of resources and financial 
results are assessed.  
We have three businesses—software and cloud, hardwa re systems and services—which are further divided i nto certain operating segments. Our 
software and cloud business is comprised of three o perating segments: (1) new software licenses and cl oud software subscriptions, which 
includes our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, (2) clo ud infrastructure as a service and (3) software lic ense updates and product support. Our 
hardware systems business is comprised of two opera ting segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2 ) hardware systems support. All other 
operating segments are combined under our services business.  
Our new software licenses and cloud software subscr iptions line of business markets, sells and deliver s our application and platform 
technologies, including our SaaS and PaaS offerings  (our SaaS and PaaS offerings are collectively refe rred to as cloud software subscriptions), 
which provide customers a choice of software applic ations and platforms that are delivered via a cloud -based IT environment that we host, 
manage and support, and the licensing of our softwa re products including Oracle Applications, Oracle D atabase, Oracle Fusion Middleware and 
Java, among others.  
The cloud infrastructure as a service line of busin ess provides comprehensive software and hardware ma nagement and maintenance services for 
customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated t erm that is hosted at our Oracle data center facili ties, select partner data centers or physically on-
premises at customer facilities; deployment and man agement offerings for our software and hardware and  related IT infrastructure including 
virtual machine instances that are subscription-bas ed and designed for computing and reliable and secu re object storage; and certain of our 
Oracle Engineered Systems and related support offer ings that are deployed in our customers’ data cente rs for a monthly fee.  
The software license updates and product support li ne of business provides customers with rights to so ftware product upgrades and maintenance 
releases, patches released, internet access to tech nical content, as well as internet and telephone ac cess to technical support personnel during the 
support period.  
The hardware systems products line of business prov ides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, n etworking, industry specific hardware, 
virtualization software, operating systems includin g the Oracle Solaris Operating System and managemen t software to support diverse IT 
environments, including cloud computing environment s.  
Our hardware systems support line of business provi des customers with software updates for the softwar e components that are essential to the 
functionality of our hardware products, such as Ora cle Solaris and certain other software products, an d can include product repairs, maintenance 
services and technical support services.

Our services business is comprised of the remainder  of our operating segments and offers consulting, a dvanced customer support services and 
education services. Our consulting line of business  primarily provides services to customers in busine ss and IT strategy alignment, enterprise 
architecture planning and design, initial product i mplementation and integration and ongoing product e nhancements and upgrades. Advanced 
customer support provides support services, both on -premises and remote, to our customers to enable in creased performance and higher 
availability of their products and services. Educat ion services provide training to customers, partner s and employees as a part of our mission of 
accelerating the adoption and use of our software a nd hardware products and to create opportunities to  grow our product revenues.  
We do not track our assets by operating segments. C onsequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.

  New software licenses and cloud software subscripti ons revenues for management reporting included reve nues related to cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts that would have otherwise been 
recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in the accompanyin g consolidated statements of operations in the amou nts of $12 million, $17 million 
and $45 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, res pectively. Software license updates and product sup port revenues for management reporting included rev enues related to software 
support contracts that would have otherwise been re corded by the acquired businesses as independent en tities but were not recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of 
operations in the amounts of $11 million, $3 millio n and $14 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, r espectively. In addition, we did not recognize hard ware systems support revenues 
related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts o f $4 million, $11 million and 
$14 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respect ively. See Note 10 for an explanation of these adju stments and the table below for a reconciliation of  our total operating segment 
revenues to our total revenues. Our new software li cense and services revenues for management reportin g also differ from amounts reported per our consoli dated statements of operations 
for the periods presented due to certain insignific ant reclassifications between these lines for manag ement reporting purposes.  
  The margins reported reflect only the direct cont rollable costs of each line of business and do not include allocations of product development, marketi ng and partner programs, and 
corporate, general and administrative and informati on technology expenses. Additionally, the margins r eported do not reflect amortization of intangible a ssets, acquisition related and 
other expenses, restructuring expenses, stock -based compensation, interest expense or certain oth er income (expense), net.

fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.  
   
   
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing ne t income for the period by the weighted average num ber of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is co mputed by dividing net income for the period by the  weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilu tive effect of outstanding stock options, restricte d stock-based awards and shares issuable 
under the employee stock purchase plan using the tr easury stock method. The following table sets forth  the computation of basic and diluted

breach of the covenant of good faith and fair deali ng, defamation, intentional interference with prosp ective economic advantage, and violation of 
the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The c omplaint alleged that when Oracle announced on Marc h 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no 
longer develop future versions of its software to r un on HP’s Itanium-based servers, it breached a set tlement agreement signed on September 20, 
2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the “Hurd Settlement  Agreement”), who was both HP’s former chief execut ive officer and chairman of HP’s 
board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaratio n of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other 
equitable and monetary relief.  
Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-com plaint, which was amended on December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged 
claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracl e alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the 
Itanium microprocessor, and had misrepresented to c ustomers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long  roadmap, among other claims. Oracle 
sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.   
The court bifurcated the trial and tried HP’s cause s of action for declaratory relief and promissory e stoppel without a jury in June 2012. The 
court issued a final statement of decision on Augus t 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreem ent required Oracle to continue to 
develop certain of its software products for use on  HP’s Itanium-based servers and to port such produc ts at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells 
those servers. Oracle has announced that it is appe aling this decision. The issues of breach, HP’s per formance, causation and damages, HP’s tort 
claims, and Oracle’s cross-claims will all be tried  before a jury. As of April 8, 2013, the trial is s tayed pending Oracle’s appeal of the court’s 
denial of its anti-SLAPP motion, which is fully bri efed, although oral argument has not yet been sched uled. We cannot currently estimate a 
reasonably possible range of loss for this action. We believe that we have meritorious defenses agains t this action, and we will continue to 
vigorously defend it.  
SAP Intellectual Property Litigation  
On March 22, 2007, Oracle Corporation, Oracle USA, Inc. and Oracle International Corporation (collecti vely, Oracle) filed a complaint in the 
United States District Court for the Northern Distr ict of California against SAP AG, its wholly-owned subsidiary, SAP America, Inc., and its 
wholly-owned subsidiary, TomorrowNow, Inc., (the SA P Subsidiary, and collectively, the SAP Defendants)  alleging that SAP unlawfully 
accessed Oracle’s Customer Connection support websi te and improperly took and used Oracle’s intellectu al property.  
After lengthy judicial proceedings, including a jur y verdict in Oracle’s favor, on August 2, 2012, Ora cle and the SAP Defendants stipulated to a 
judgment of $306 million against the SAP Defendants . We recorded a $306 million receivable in our cons olidated balance sheet and we 
recognized a corresponding benefit to our results o f operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. After further proceedings, including an appeal, 
on November 14, 2014, final judgment was entered in  Oracle’s favor in the amount of $356.7 million plu s post-judgment interest of 
approximately $2.5 million. During the second quart er of fiscal 2015, Oracle received the total paymen t of approximately $359.2 million, of 
which $306 million was applied against the receivab le recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and  the excess of $53 million was recorded as a 
benefit to our results of operations. This action i s now concluded.  
Other Litigation  
We are party to various other legal proceedings and  claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise  in the ordinary course of business, 
including proceedings and claims that relate to acq uisitions we have completed or to companies we have  acquired or are attempting to acquire. 
While the outcome of these matters cannot be predic ted with certainty, we do not believe that the outc ome of any of these matters, individually 
or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are  materially in excess of amounts already recognized , if any.

6. Changes in Capitalization; Change of Control .

of the following: (1) electing to have the Company withhold from Participant’s other cash compensation  paid to Participant by the 
Company; (2) electing to have the Company withhold from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon v esting of the Award, either 
through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sal e arranged by the Company (on    and the obligations of the Company under the Plan a re assumed by the successor corporation), the sale of substantially all of the 
assets of the Company, or any other transaction des cribed under Section 424(a) of the U.S. Internal Re venue Code (the “Code”) 
wherein the stockholders of the Company give up all  of their equity interest in the Company (except fo r the acquisition of all or 
substantially all of the outstanding shares of the Company), this Award shall accelerate and become ve sted in full prior to the 
consummation of such dissolution, liquidation, merg er or sale of assets. 
  c) Acceleration Upon Unfriendly Takeover . Notwithstanding anything in Section 6(b) hereof t o the contrary, if fifty percent 
(50%) or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Company become beneficially owned (as define d in Rule 13d-3 
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commissi on) by a person (as defined in Section 2(2) of the Securities Act and in 
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) in a transact ion or series of transactions expressly disapproved  by the Board, then this 
Award shall automatically and immediately accelerat e and become vested in full. 
7. Compliance with Laws and Regulations . The issuance and transfer of Shares shall be subj ect to compliance by the Company and 
Participant with all applicable requirements of fed eral, state, local or foreign securities and other laws and with all applicable

Award. 
9. Tax Withholding . Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company, the ultimate liability  for all income tax 
(including federal, state, local and foreign tax), social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax,  payment on account or other tax-related 
items related to Participant’s participation in the  Plan and legally applicable to Participant or deem ed by the Company in its discretion to 
be an appropriate charge to Participant even if leg ally applicable to the Company (“Tax-Related Items” ), is and remains Participant’s 
responsibility. Participant further acknowledges th at the Company (a) makes no representations or unde rtakings regarding the treatment

to and is under no obligation to structure the term s of the grant or any aspect of this Award to reduc e or eliminate Participant’s liability 
for Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant is subject to T ax-Related Items in more than one 
jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date  of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, Participant acknowledges that the 
Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax -Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
Participant’s behalf pursuant to this authorization ); or (3) electing to have the Company withhold Sha res otherwise issuable upon 
settlement of the Award. If the obligation for the Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Sh ares, the Company will withhold or 
account for Tax-Related Items by considering applic able minimum statutory withholding rates. If the Sh ares are sold to cover the Tax-
Related Items obligations, the Company may use othe r applicable withholding rates, including maximum a pplicable rates, in which case 
Participant will receive a refund of any over-withh eld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the common stock equivalent. 
Further, if the obligation for the Tax-Related Item s is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax pu rposes, Participant is deemed to have 
been issued the full number of Shares subject to th e vested stock units underlying this Award, notwith standing that a number of the 
Shares are held back solely for the purpose of payi ng the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any asp ect of Participant’s participation in 
the Plan.
