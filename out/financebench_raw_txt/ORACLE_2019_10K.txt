T I Item 1.
Business Oracle
 provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  applications  andinfrastructure
 offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premisedeployments, cloud-based
 deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our OracleCloud
 at  Customer  offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  andfacilitate
 the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, governmentagencies,
 educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle PartnerNetwork.
Oracle
 Cloud  Software-as-a-Service  and  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (SaaS  and  IaaS,  respectively,  and  collectively,  Oracle  Cloud  Services)  offerings  provide  acomprehensive
 and integrated stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via a cloud-based deployment model. Oracle Cloud Services integratethe
 software,  hardware  and  services  on  a  customer’s  behalf  in  a  cloud-based  IT  environment  that  Oracle  deploys,  upgrades,  supports  and  manages  for  thecustomer. Oracle Cloud Services are
 designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users;easily
 maintainable  to  reduce  upgrade,  integration  and  testing  work;  connectable  among  differing  deployment  models  to  enable  interchangeability  andextendibility
 between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiringlower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable.
Oracle
 cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle  Middleware  software  offerings,among
 others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially allcustomers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.
Oracle
 hardware product offerings include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others, and customers generallyopt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware.
Oracle also offers services to
 assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.Providing
 choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important elementof
 our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications andinfrastructure
 technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewerofferings and more restrictive deployment models.
Our
 investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our cloud and license, hardware and services businesses(described
 further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, we invested $6.0 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.2billion,
 respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and products and to develop new technologies and services. Wehave
 a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts onimproving
 the performance, security, operation and integration of our technologies to improve the computing performance of our products and services relativeto
 our competitors’ offerings, to be more cost-effective, and to be easier for customers to deploy, manage and maintain. For example, we believe that Oracleapplications
 and  platform  technologies,  such  as  the  Oracle  Database,  when  combined  with  other  Oracle  infrastructure  technologies  deliver  improvedperformance
 at a lower cost relative to competing infrastructure technologies and provide customers flexibility through a choice of cloud-based and on-premisedeployment models
. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development effortsand
 deep  IT  expertise  by  electing  to  purchase  and  renew  Oracle  support  offerings  for  their  license  and  hardware  deployments,  which  may  include  productenhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle
 Cloud Services contracts with us.3

Our
 selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products andservic 
es  that  we  can  offer  to  customers,  expand  our  customer  base,  provide  greater  scale  to  accelerate  innovation,  grow  our  revenues  and  earnings,  andincrease
 stockholder  value.  In  recent  years,  we  have collectively invested  billions  of  dollars  to  acquire  a  num ber  of  companies,  products,  services  andtechnologies
 that  add  to,  are  complementary  to,  or  have  otherwise  enhanced  our  existing  offerings.  We  expect  to  continue  to  acquire  companies,  products,services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.
We have three businesses:
 
•our  cloud and license business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our Oracle Cloud Services offerings, cloud license andon-premise
 license  offerings,  and  license  support  offerings,  represented  83%,  81%  and  80%  of  our  total  revenues  in  fiscal  2019,  2018  and  2017,respectively;
 
•our hardware business, which is comprised of a  single operating segment and includes our hardware products and related hardware support servicesofferings, represented 9%, 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively; and
 
•our  services business, which is comprised of a single operating segment, represented 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 and 9% of our totalrevenues in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017.
Management’s
 Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  results  of  Operations  and  Note  15  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  bothincluded elsewhere in this Annual report, provide additional information related t
o our businesses and operating segments.Oracle Corporation was incorporated 
in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.Applications and Infrastructure Technologies
Oracle’s
 comprehensive  portfolio  of  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  is  designed  to  address  an  organization’s  IT  environment  needs  includingbusiness
 process,  infrastructure  and  applications  development  requirements,  among  others.  Oracle  technologies  are  based  upon  industry  standards  and  aredesigned
 to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure. Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies including database and middleware softwareas
 well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services are the buildingblocks
 of  Oracle  Cloud  Services,  our  partners’  cloud  services,  and  our  customers’  cloud  IT  environments.  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  aremarketed and sold through
 our cloud and license, hardware, and services businesses and are delivered through the Oracle Cloud, or through other IT deploymentmodels including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise. We believe Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings enable flexib
ility, interoperability and choice tobest meet customer IT needs.
We believe that our Oracle Cloud Services offerings ar
e opportunities for us to expand our cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasinglyrecognize
 the value of access to cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, rapidly deployable, flexible and interoperable servicesmodel
 that  Oracle  manages  and  maintains  on  the  customer’s  behalf.  We  believe  that  we  can  market  and  sell  our  SaaS  and  IaaS  offerings  together  to  helpcustomers migrate their extensive installed base of 
on-premise applications and infrastructure technologies to the Oracle Cloud while at the same time reaching abroader ecosystem of
 developers and partners. We also believe we can market our SaaS and IaaS services to small and medium-sized businesses and non-IT linesof business purchasers due to the highly available, intuitive design, low touch and lo
w cost characteristics of the Oracle Cloud.4

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
In
 recent periods, customer demand f or  our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services deployment models hasincreased.
 To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applica tions  andinfrastructure 
licenses  and  license  support  contracts  to the  Oracle  Cloud  for  new  deployments  and  to migrate  to and  expand  with  the  Oracle  Cloud  for  theirexisting workloads. We expect these trends to continue.
Oracle License Support
Oracle
 license support offerings are marketed and sold as a part of our cloud and license business. Substantially all of our customers opt to purchase licensesupport
 contracts when they purchase Oracle applications and infrastructure licenses to run within the Oracle Cloud or other cloud-based and on-premise ITenvironments.
 We believe our license support offerings protect and enhance our customers’ investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologiesbecause
 they provide proactive and personalized support services including Oracle Lifetime Support and unspecified license enhancements and upgrades duringthe
 term of the support period. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefitfrom
 technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled toreceive. Our license support
 contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license and are typically one year induration.
Applications Technologies
Oracle
 applications technologies are marketed, sold and delivered through our cloud and license business and represented 35%, 34% and 33% of our cloud andlicense
 business  revenues  during  fiscal  2019,  2018  and  2017,  respectively.  Oracle  applications  technologies  consist  of  comprehensive  cloud-based  offeringsincluding
 our Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings, which are available for customers as a subscription, and Oracle Applications license offerings, which are available forcustomers
 to purchase for use in Oracle Cloud IaaS, other cloud-based, and on-premise IT environments with the option to purchase related license support.regardless
 of  the  deployment  model  selected,  our  applications  technologies  are  designed  to  reduce  the  risk,  cost  and  complexity  of  our  customers’  ITinfrastructures,
 while supporting customer choice with flexible deployment models that readily enable performance, agility, compatibility and extendibility. Ourapplicati
ons technologies are generally designed using industry standard architectures to manage and automate core business functions across the enterprise, aswell
 as to help customers differentiate and innovate in those processes unique to their industries or organizations. We offer applications that are deployable tomeet
 a number of business automation requirements across a broad range of industries. We also offer industry-specific applications through a focused strategyof
 investments  in  internal  development  and  strategic  acquisitions,  which  provide  solutions  to  customers  in  communications,  construction  and  engineering,financial services, health sciences, hospitality, manufacturing, public sector, retail and utilities, among other 
industries.Oracle Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS)
Oracle’s broad
 spectrum of Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings provides customers a choice of software applications that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environmentthat
 we host, manage, upgrade and support, and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our SaaS offeringsare
 built upon open industry standards such as SQL, Java and HTML5 for easier application accessibility, integration and development. Our SaaS offerings includea
 broad suite of modular, next-generation cloud software applications that span core business functions including enterprise resource planning (ErP), humancapital
 management (HCM), customer experience (CX), and supply chain management (SCM), among others. We also offer a number of cloud-based industrysolutions to address specific customer needs within certain industries.

We
 believe that the comprehensiveness and breadth of our SaaS offerings differentiate u s  from many of our competitors that offer more limited or specializedapplications.
 Our SaaS offerings are designed to support connected business processes in the cloud and are centered on a responsive and flexible business coreand
 a common data model. We believe  our cloud ErP offerings drive adoption of our other SaaS offerings as our customers realize benefits of a common datamodel
 utilized across our SaaS offerings. Our SaaS offerings are designed to deliver a secure data isolation architecture and fle xible  upgrades; self-service accesscontrols
 for  users;  a  Service-Oriented  Architecture  (SOA);  built-in  social,  mobile  and  business  insight  capabilities;  and  a  high  performance,  high  availabilityinfrastructure
 based on our infrastructure technologies, inc luding  Oracle Engineered Systems. These SaaS capabilities are designed to simplify IT environments,reduce
 time to implementation and risk, provide an intuitive user experience for casual and experienced users, and enable customers to focus resources on business growth opportunities. Our SaaS offerings are a

Infrastructure Technologies
Oracle infrastructure technologies are marketed, sold and delivered through our cloud and license business and through our hardware business.
Our cloud and license business’ infrastructure technologies include the Oracle Database, which is the world’s most popular enterprise dat
abase; Java, which is thecomputer
 industry’s most widely-used software development language; middleware; and development tools, among others. These technologies are availablethrough
 subscription to our Oracle Cloud IaaS offerings or with the purchase of a license to run within the Oracle Cloud or other cloud-based and on-premise ITenvironments
 and  related  license  support  at  the  customer’s  option.  Our  infrastructure  technologies  are  designed  to  provide  cost-effective,  standards-based,high-performance
 platforms  and  infrastructure  to  develop,  run,  integrate,  manage  and  extend  business  applications.  Our  cloud  and  license  infrastructuretechnologies
 also provide  cloud-based  compute,  storage  and  networking  capabilities through  our  Oracle  Cloud  IaaS  offerings.  Our  customers  are  increasinglyfocused on developing in
novations and reducing the total cost of their IT infrastructure, and we believe that Oracle infrastructure technologies help them achievethis goal.
In
 addition  to  utilizing  our  cloud  and  license  business’  infrastructure  technologies  to  modernize  approaches  to  their  IT  environments,  customer  interest  isincreasing
 for emerging technologies such as IoT, chatbots and AI/ML to automate business processes, reduce human error and provide a platform to build newand
 innovative applications. We deliver emerging technologies through certain of our applications and infrastructure technologies, including as a part of OracleAutonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service, which is described further below.
Our
 hardware  business’  infrastructure  technologies  include  hardware  products  and  certain  unique  hardware-related  software  offerings,  such  as  OracleEngineered
 Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware,  virtualization  software,  operating  systems,  management  software,  and  related  hardwareservices including support at the customer’s option.
We
 design our infrastructure technologies to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components.Our
 flexible and open approach provides Oracle customers a choice as to how they can utilize and deploy Oracle infrastructure technologies: through the use ofOracle
 Cloud  offerings;  in  our  customers’  data  centers;  or  a  hybrid  combination  of  these  two  deployment  models,  such  as  in  the  Oracle  Cloud  at  Customerdeployment
 model.  We  focus  on  the  operation  and  integration  of  Oracle  infrastructure  technologies  to  make  them  easier  to  deploy,  extend,  interconnect,manage
 and  maintain  for  our  customers  and  to  improve  computing  performance  relative  to  our  competitors’  offerings.  For  example,  we  design  OracleEngineered Systems to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to 
work together to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operationalefficiency relative to our competitors’ products.

Oracle Cloud Operations
Oracle
 Cloud  Operations  deliver  our  Oracle  Cloud  Services  to  customers  through  a  secure,  reliable,  scalable,  enterprise  grade  cloud  infrastructure  platformmanaged
 by  our  employees  within  a  global  network  of  data  centers,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  Oracle  Cloud.  Oracle  Cloud  Operations  leverage  automatedsoftware
 tools to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the Oracle Cloud as they become available. The Oracle Cloud enablessecure and isolated cloud-based instances for each of our customers to access the functionalit
y of our Oracle Cloud Services via a broad spectrum of devices.Manufacturing
To
 produce  our  hardware  products  that  we  market  and  sell  to  third-party  customers  and  that  we  utilize  internally  to  deliver  as  a  part  of  our  Oracle  Cloudoperations,
 we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consistprimaril
y of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center serversand
 storage products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components andhardware
 products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these componentsand products. We distribute most of our hardware products from either our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufactur
ing processes are substantially based onstandardization
 of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a “build-to-order” methodology in which productsgenerally
 are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, productsubassemblies
 and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sourcesare
 readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruptionto
 our supply chain operations. refer to “risk Factors” included in Item 1A within this Annual report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounterwith respect to the sources and availability
 of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.Sales and Marketing
We
 directly market and sell our cloud, license, hardware and services offerings to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies andeducationa
l institutions. We also market and sell our offerings through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues infiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.
In
 the United States (U.S.), our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the U.S., ourinternati
onal subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate througha
 direct  sales  subsidiary.  Our  geographic  coverage  allows  us  to  draw  on  business  and  technical  expertise  from  a  global  workforce,  provides  stability  to  ouroperations
 and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings.Our
 international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in “risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual report. A summary ofour
 domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual report.

We
 also  market  our  product  offerings  worldwide  through  indirect  channels.  The  companies  that  comprise  our  indirect  channel  network  are  members  of  theOracle
 Partner  Network.  The  Oracle  Partner  Network  is  a  global  program  that  manages  our  business  relations hips  with  a  large,  broad-based  network  ofcompanies,
 including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based uponour
 product offerings. By offering our partners access to o ur  product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, theOracle
 Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. 
The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Research and Development
We
 develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property throughacquisitions
 of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us tomaintain technical
 control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relateto
 various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principalbusinesses.
 rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changingcustomer
 needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue todedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to
 maintain and improve our current product and service offerings.Employees
As
 of May 31, 2019, we employed approximately 136,000 full-time employees, including approximately 39,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 18,000 inour
 cloud services and license support operations, approximately 4,000  in hardware, approximately 24,000  in services, approximately 38,000  in research anddevelopment
 and  approximately  13,000  in  general  and  administrative  positions.  Of  these  employees,  approximately  48,000  were  employed  in  the  U.S.  andapproxim
ately 88,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the U.S. is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries,labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our empl
oyees.Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our
 quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans,which
 are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter andlowest
 in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) are generallyaffected
 by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues because certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See“Cloud
 and  License  Business”  and  “Selected  Quarterly  Financial  Data”  in  Item  7  of  this  Annual  report  for  more  information  regarding  the  seasonality  andcyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.
Competition
We
 face intense  competition  in all aspects  of our business.  The nature of the IT industry  creates  a competitive  landscape  that is constantly  evolving as firmsemerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise
 change.13

Our
 customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprisesoftware
 and hardware. Our enterprise cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware offerings com pete  directly with certain offerings from some of thelargest
 and most competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM),Intel
 Corporation,  Cisco  Systems,  Inc.,  Adobe  S ystems  Incorporated,  Alphabet  Inc.  and  SAP  SE,  as  well  as  other  companies  like  Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise,salesforce.com,
 inc. and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and gro wing competitors frequently emerge to
 challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of businessto
 vendors  providing  point  solutions,  or  offerings  focused  on  a  specific  functionality,  pro duct  area  or  industry.  In  addition,  as  we  expand  into  new  marketsegments, we face increased
 competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and otherfirms
 with whom we have not pre viously  competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions—including acquisitions, partnershipsand joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines—which invite even greater competition in one or
 more product offering categories . key
 competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance,scalability,
 reliability,  security,  functionality,  efficiency,  speed  to  production  and  quality  of  technical  support.  Our  product  and  service  sales  (and  the  relativestrength of our products and services versus those of our competitors) are als
o directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things: 
•the adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS and IaaS offerings; 
•ease of deployment, use and maintenance of our products and services offerings; 
•compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our OracleCloud environments;
 
•the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; 
•the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; 
•operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server, andother UNIX and Linux operating systems;
 
•the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; 
•products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; 
•products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and 
•attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.For more information about the competitive r

Item 1A.
R isk FactorsWe
 operate  in  rapidly  changing  economic  and  technological  environments  that  present  numerous  risks,  many  of  which  are  driven  by  factors  that  we  cannotcontrol
 or predict. The following discussion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial
 Condition and results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described  below are not exhaustive and you should carefullyconsider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
Our
 success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products andservices. 
    rapid  technological  advances,  intense  competition,  changing  delivery  models  and  evolving  standards  in  computer  hardware  and  softwaredevelopment
 and  communications  infrastructure,  changing  and  increasingly  sophisticated  customer  needs  and  frequent  new  product  introductions  andenhancements
 characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhanceand
 improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may notpurchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. renewals of these
contracts
 are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop newproducts will allow us to compete effective
ly for business opportunities in emerging areas.We
 have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services, including the launch of the Oracle Autonomous Data WarehouseCloud
 Service.  The  Oracle  Autonomous  Data  Warehouse  Cloud  Service  offers  automation  based  on  machine  learning  and  we  have  guaranteed,  among  othermatters, that it
 will reduce customer downtime to less than 30 minutes a year and that Amazon Data Warehouse customers will see a significant cost reduction ifthey
 migrate  their  workloads  to  our  offering.  Machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence  are  increasingly  driving  innovations  in  technology  but  if  they  fail  tooperate as
 anticipated or the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service or our other products do not perform as promised, our business and reputationmay be harmed.
In addition, our business may be adversely affected if:
 
•we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames; 
•infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated; 
•there is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new, enhanced or acquired product lines orservices;
 
•there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts; 
•we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner; or 
•we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.Our
 Oracle  Cloud  strategy,  including  our  Oracle  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS)  and  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)  offerings,  may  adversely  affect  ourrevenues
 and profitability.     We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs, including viaour
 cloud-based SaaS and IaaS offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenuesor
 maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitorsmay
 unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloudcomputing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitabilit
y could decline.16

As customer
 demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing ofrevenue
 recognition  between  our  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license,  and  hardware product arrangements  relative  to  our  cloud  offering  arrangements.Customers
 generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms ofthe
 subscriptions. Consequently, any  deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidatedstatement of operations. This is in contrast 
to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements , which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related 
licenses and hardware products . We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies, and the integration of these companie
s into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient orscalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our abi
lity to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions.We
 might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.     Despite  testing prior to therelease
 and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors thatcan
 impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud,license
 or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function,integrate
 or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions ofproducts
 or services, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services.This
 includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardwareofferings
 or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations as well ascloud
 and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our and our customers’ abilities toconduct
 business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs. Enterprise customers rely on ourcloud,
 license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related servicescould
 expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our futuresales.
If
 our  security  measures  for  our  products  and  services  are  compromised  and  as  a  result,  our  data,  our  customers’  data  or  our  IT  systems  are  accessedimproperly,
 made  unavailable,  or  improperly  modified,  our  products  and  services  may  be  perceived  as  vulnerable,  our  brand  and  reputation  could  bedamaged,
 the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduceour
 revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.     We are in the IT business, and our products andservices,
 including our Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, as well as our owndata.
 We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protectingthe
 integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. At times, we encounter attempts by third parties (whichmay
 include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation states and individuals sponsored bythem)
 to  identify  and  exploit  product  and  service  vulnerabilities,  penetrate  or  bypass  our  security  measures,  and  gain  unauthorized  access  to  our  or  ourcustomers’,
 partners’  and  suppliers’  software,  hardware  and  cloud  offerings,  networks  and  systems,  any  of  which  could  lead  to  the  compromise  of  personalinformation
 or  the  confidential  information  or  data  of  Oracle  or  our  customers.  Computer  hackers  and  others  may  be  able  to  develop  and  deploy  IT  relatedviruses,
 worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilitiesof
 our  networks,  systems,  products  and  services,  create  system  disruptions  and  cause  shutdowns  or  denials  of  service.  This  is  also  true  for  third-party  data,products or
 services incorporated into our own. Our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud Services may also be accessed or modified improperly as aresult
 of customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees orsuppliers
 into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers’, suppliers’or partners’ data or the IT systems of Oracle, 
our customers, suppliers or partners.17

Security
 industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-a ttacks  targeting IT products and businesses. Although thisis an
 industry-wide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus theirefforts
 on the most prominent IT com panies,  and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secureproducts
 and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large am ounts  of data, includingpersonal
 information  and  our  customers’  confidential  information  and  data,  and  host  or  manage  parts  of  our  customers’  businesses  in  cloud-based  ITenvironments,
 especially  in  customer  sectors  involving  particularly  sensitive  data  s uch  as  health  sciences,  financial  services,  retail,  hospitality  and  thegovernment. 
We  also have an active acquisition program and have acquired  a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we
 make significant efforts to address  any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle.
Because
 the  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to,  or  sabotage  IT  systems  change  frequently,  grow  more  complex  over  time,  and  often  are  notrecognized
 until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques. Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often e
arly adapters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls m ay not keep pacewith
 these changes as new threats emerge. In addition, we may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after thesecurity breach.
We
 could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modificationof
 our customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or ifour
 products or services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability ofour
 products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to not be secure. This could lead to fewer customers using our products and servicesand
 result in reduced revenues and earnings. The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types ofsecurity
 incidents  could  also  lead  to  loss  or  destruction  of  information,  inappropriate  use  of  proprietary  and  sensitive  data,  lawsuits,  indemnity  obligations,regulatory investigations and financial penalties, an
d claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notificationand fraud monitoring.
Our
 products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one ofthese components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claim
s, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harmto our reputation or competitive position.
Our
 business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation,legal
 requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.     As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase andworldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal inform
ation expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection anduse within
 our business will intensify. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in thenear future interpret existing leg
islation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners anddata
 providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. For example,certain data transfer mechanisms are currently subject
 to challenges in European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers tothe
 U.S. or interruption of such transfers. In the event any court blocks transfers to or from a particular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms arelegally
 adequate, this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee information,regulatory
 liabilities  or  reputational  harm.  This  impact  could  also  occur  in  those  jurisdictions  where  privacy  laws  or  regulators  take  a  broader  view  of  howpersonal
 information is defined, therefore subjecting  the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to our operations and theoperations
 of our customers, partners and data providers. This impact could be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation thatrequires
 data  to  remain  localized “in  country,”  as  this  imposes  financial  costs  on  any  service  provider  that  is  required  to  store  data  in  jurisdictions  not  of  itschoosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult and costly t
o integrate with global processes.18

In the wake of the European Union 
General Data Protection regulation (GDPr), the r ate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased, givingrise
 to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory in quiries  and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if not deemed to be in compliance, could result in enforcement
 actions and/or fines. Th is is true in the U.S. where  California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) effective in Janua ry 2020,Congress
 is considering several privacy bills at the federal level , and other state legislatures are considering privacy laws. regulators globally are also imposinggreater
 monetary fines for privacy violations. The GDPr, which became effective in May  2018, provides for monetary penalties of up to 4% of an organization’s worldwide
 revenue. One European data protection regulator has fined a major U.S. technology company EUr 50 million for its data handling practices. The U.S. Federal Trade Commissio 
n continues to fine companies on a regular basis for unfair and deceptive data protection practices, and these fines may increase in size.The
 CCPA  provides  for  statutory  damages  on  a  per  violation  basis  that  could  be  very  large  in  the  event  of  a  significa nt  data  security  b reach  or other CCPAviolation. 
Taken  together, the changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increasethe
 size of potential fines related to data protection , a nd our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices oreven
 prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have implemented contracts, policies and procedures des igned to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulati
ons, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners, data providers or agents will notviolate
 such  laws and  regulations  or  our  contracts,  policies  and  procedures.  Additionall y,  public  perception  and  standards  related  to  the  privacy  of  personalinformation
 can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to providecertain products 
. We
 make  statements  about  our  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  through  our  privacy  policy,  information  provided  on  our  website  and  pressstatements.
 Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, includinglaws
 and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations,could
 result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affectour business and harm our reputation.
Economic,
 political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth andprofitability,
 which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.       Our  business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that wehave no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:
 
•general economic and business conditions; 
•overall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services; 
•governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and 
•general legal, regulatory and political developments.Macroeconomic
 developments like the developments associated with the United kingdom’s vote to exit the EU (Brexit), evolving trade policies between the U.S.and
 international trade partners, or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic, political or marketconditions
 could  negatively  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  financial  condition  and  outlook,  which,  in  turn,  could  adversely  affect  our  stock  price.  Anygeneral
 weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could causecurrent
 or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of ourproducts and services or cause customers not to pay us or to dela
y paying us for previously purchased products and services.19

In
 addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and  the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for otherhostilities
 in  various  parts  of  the  world,  potential  public  health  crises  and  natural  disasters  continue  to  contribute  to  a  climate  of  economic  and  politica l uncertainty
 that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generallyhave the
 strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware an d related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.
If we
 are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.      We face intense competition in all aspects of
 our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technologyevolves
 and as delivery models change. Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructuretechnologies
 including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence,compute,
 storage  and  networking  products,  among  others,  which  compete  with  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings.  Use  of  our  competitors’technologies
 may influence a customer’s purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products andservices.
 Our competition may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may notgenerally
 find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose customers if our competitors introducenew competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competit
ive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer moreflexible
 business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives inwhich
 competitors  may  provide  software  and  intellectual  property  for  free.  Existing  or  new  competitors  could  gain  sales  opportunities  or  customers  at  ourexpense.
We
 may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.     The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and generaleconomic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If
 our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or developproducts
 that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any suchchanges
 may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and ourcompetitors
 may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services offerings, and we may also incur increased cloud deliveryexpenses
 as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and/or profitability. Our license support feesand
 hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors mayoffer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings.
We
 introduced  Oracle  Bring  Your  Own  License  (BYOL)  and  Universal  Credit  Pricing  to  simplify  the  way  customers  purchase  and  consume  our  cloud  services.Oracle
 BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle Infrastructure while expanding their platform technology footprint at adiscounted price.
 Oracle Universal Credit Pricing provides a flexible model for customers to access Oracle Infrastructure services on demand via a single contract.Any
 future changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjustto the
 new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy, commit to large customerdeployments
 at  prices  that  are  unprofitable,  or  provide  guarantees  of  prices  and  product  implementations.  These  practices  could,  over  time,  significantlyconstrain
 the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products orchanges in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us t
o change our pricing models.20

Our
 international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.     We derive  a substantial portion of ourrevenues
 from,  and  have  significant  operations,  outside  of  the  U.S.  Our  international  operations  include  cloud  operations,  cloud,  software  and  hardwaredevelopment, manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, cons 
ulting and other services and shared administrative service centers. Compliance
 with  international  and  U.S.  laws  and  regulations  that  apply  to  our  international  operations  increases  our  cost  of  doing  business  in  foreignjurisdictions. These laws and regulations include U.S. laws and l
ocal laws which include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related
 regulations, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, market access, tariffs, import, export and general traderegulations,
 including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminalsanctions
 against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges. Any such violationscould result in
 prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could alsomaterially
 damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operatingresults.
 Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from runningour business
 operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources toassist
 us  with  our  compliance  efforts.  Our  success  depends,  in  part,  on  our  ability  to  anticipate  these  risks  and  manage  these  difficulties.  We  monitor  ouroperations
 and  investigate  allegations  of  improprieties  relating  to  transactions  and  the  way  in  which  such  transactions  are  recorded.  Where  circumstanceswarrant,
 we  provide  information  and  report  our  findings  to  government  authorities,  but  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  action  will  not  be  taken  by  suchauthorities.
We are also subject to a variety
 of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to: 
•general economic conditions in each country or region; 
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results; 
•difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular ourcash assets, in that country’s currency;
 
•regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that mayunexpectedly
 impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required topay in these countries;
 
•political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; 
•common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; 
•natural disasters; 
•the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); 
•longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 
•overlapping tax regimes; 
•public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; and 
•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.21

The variety of risks and challenges listed above
 could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.
As
 the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly tradedcompany
 in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that wewould otherwise have if these entities were
 wholly-owned subsidiaries.Any
 failure  to  offer  high-quality  technical  support  services  may  adversely  affect  our  relationships  with  our  customers  and  our  financial  results .     O urcustomers depend
 on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respondquickly
 enough  to  accommodate  short-term  increases  in  customer  demand  for  support  services.  Increased  customer  demand  for  these  services,  withoutcorresponding
 revenues,  could  increase  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  or  a  marketperception
 that  we  do  not  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  our  ability  to  sell  our  applications  to  existing  andprospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.
We
 may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.     Our  revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license andon-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly
 operating results can fluctuate.For
 our Oracle Cloud Services, our actual conversion or renewal rates may differ from those used in our forecasts because this business is continuing to evolveand
 such  rates  may  be  unpredictable  which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  long-term  results.  For  our  license  business,  we  use  a  “pipeline”  system,  acommon
 industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in that business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customerwill make
 a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimatescan
 be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contractscan
 be very difficult  to estimate. A reduction  in the conversion  rates, renewal rates, or in the pipeline itself, could adversely affect our business  or results ofoperations.
 In  particular,  a  slowdown  in  IT  spending  or  economic  conditions  generally  can  unexpectedly  reduce  the  conversion  rates  and  renewal  rates  inparticular period
s as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some of ourcustomers
 to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute anddeliver upon these contracts
 in a timely manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert intosales
 or  revenues  for  a  number  of  quarters  following  the  acquisition.  Conversion  rates  and  renewal  rates  post-acquisition  may  be  quite  different  from  theacquired
 companies’ historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that weimplement in our newly acquired companies. These changes may negatively affect customer behavi
or.A
 substantial portion of the revenue value of our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and asignificant
 percentage of these are larger value orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenueshortfalls
 tend  to  have  a  disproportionately  negative  impact  on  our  profitability.  The  number  of  large  license  transactions  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  hardwareproducts
 transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause ourquarterly sales, revenues and profitability to f
all significantly short of our predictions.22

We
 may  experience  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses.  Changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  can  adversely  affect  customer  demand  and  our  revenue  andprofitability. 
     We conduct a significant number of transactions and ho ld  cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreigncurrencies,
 particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and
 cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to Brexit and European sovereign and other debt obligationsmay
 cause the value of the British Pound and Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fl uctuations  in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening ofthe
 U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report inU.S.
 Dollars  after  convertin g  our  foreign  currency  results  into  U.S.  Dollars  and  in  terms  of  actual  demand  for  our  products  and  services  as  certain  of  theseproducts may become relatively more expensive for
 foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variati ons can adversely affect margins on
 sales  of  our  products  in  countries  outside  of  the  U.S.  Generally,  our  reported  revenues  and  operating  results  are  adversely  affected  when  the  dollarstrengthens
 relative to other currencies and are positively affected wh en  the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affectedwhen
 the  dollar  strengthens  relative  to  other  currencies  as  a  portion  of  our  consolidated  cash  and  bank  deposits,  among  other  assets,  are  held  in  foreigncurrencies 
. In
 addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and oursubsidiari
es that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizesforeign
 currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time totime. As part of this program, we enter into fore
ign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at leastin part by gains or losses on
 the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactiongains or
 losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to ourforeign currency
 exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and lossesin
 certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend ourforeign
 currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type ofcross-currency
 exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have enteredinto foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.
 All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financialposition and cash flows.
We
 have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Wecould incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationar
y.Our periodic workforce restruc
turings and reorganizations can be disruptive.     We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce inresponse to
 management changes, product changes, performance issues, change in strategies, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In thepast,
 these types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their newroles
 and  responsibilities.  In  addition,  we  may  not  achieve  or  sustain  the  expected  growth,  resource  redeployment  or  cost  savings  benefits  of  theserestructurings, or may not
 do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and ourrevenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.

We
 may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.     We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of oursenior
 management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer  and founder; our Chief Executive Officers; other members of our executive
 team ; and  other  key  employees.  In  the  technology  industry,  there  is  substantial  and  continuous  competition  for  highly  skilled  business,  productdevelopment,
 technical  and  oth er  personnel.  We  may  also  experience  increased  compensation  costs  that  are  not  offset  by  either  improved  productivity  orhigher
 sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare except ions,  we do not havelong-term
 employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for avariety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there w
ill not be additional departures , which may be disruptive to our operations. We
 continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available atlower
 costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with  workforce  reductions  that  delay  the  benefit  of  a  moreefficient workforce structure. We
 may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, whichmay
 affect  our  employee  retention  efforts  and  increase  our  expenses  in  an  effort  to  offer  a  competitive  compensation  program.  In  addition,  changes  toimmigration and labor law po
licies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.Our
 general  compensation  program  includes  restricted  stock  units  and  performance-based  equity,  which  are  important  tools  in  attracting  and  retainingemployees
 in  our  industry.  If  our  stock  price  performs  poorly,  it  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  retain  or  attract  employees.  We  continually  evaluate  ourcompensation
 practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equityawards granted per employee and
 granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and theamount
 of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability toretain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.
Our
 sales  to  government  clients  expose  us  to  business  volatility  and  risks,  including  government  budgeting  cycles  and  appropriations,  procurementregulations,
 governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.     We derive revenues from contractswith
 the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award,administration and performance of those contracts.
Governmental
 entities  are  variously  pursuing  policies  that  affect  our  ability  to  sell  our  products  and  services.  Changes  in  government  procurement  policy,priorities, technology initiatives, and/or contract award criter
ia may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector.We
 are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time, without cause. Forexample,
 the  U.S.  federal  government  may  terminate  any  of  our  government  contracts  and  subcontracts  at  its  convenience,  or  for  default  based  on  ourperformance.
U.S.
 federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts withU.S.
 state  and  local  governments,  foreign  governments  and  their  agencies  are  generally  subject  to  government  funding  authorizations.  Contracts  may  beterminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds.
There
 is  increased  pressure  on  governments  and  their  agencies,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  to  reduce  spending  as  governments  continue  to  facesignificant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.
Government
 contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found,they
 could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture ofprofits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.

Acquisitions
 present many risks and we may not achieve the  financi al  and  strategic  goals that  were contemplated  at the time of a transaction.        Wecontinue to 
make strategic acquisitions of c ompanies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect tocontinue
 to ma ke  acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy. risks we may face in connectionwith o 
ur acquisition program include:  
•our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; 
•we  may  have  difficulties  (1)  managing  an  acquired  company’s  technologies  or  lines  of  business;  (2)  entering  new  markets  where  we  have  no,  orlimited,
 direct  prior  experience  or  where  competitors  may  have  stronger  market  positions;  or  (3)  retaining  key  personnel  from  the  acquiredcompanies;
 
•an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as weexpected, we may impose our
 business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for,or otherwise not realize the expecte
d return on our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially causeimpairment to assets that we recorded as a
 part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill; 
•our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  (1)  claims  or  liabilities  that  we  assume  from  an  acquired  company  ortechnology
 or  that  are  otherwise  related  to  an  acquisition,  including,  among  others,  claims  from  government  agencies,  terminated  employees,current
 or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships that we assume from an acquiredcompany
 that  we  would  not  have  otherwise  entered  into,  the  termination  or  modification  of  which  may  be  costly  or  disruptive  to  our  business;(3)
 unfavorable  revenue  recognition  or  other  accounting  treatment  as  a  result  of  an  acquired  company’s  practices;  and  (4)  intellectual  propertyclaims or disputes;
 
•we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology,which
 could result in (1) unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, (2) unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, (3)the loss of anticipated tax benefits or 
(4) other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition; 
•we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including (1) if a larger than predictednumber
 of customers decline to renew cloud-based subscription contracts or license support or hardware support contracts, (2) if we are unable tosell
 the  acquired  products  or  service offerings to our  customer  base,  (3)  if acquired  customers  do not elect to  purchase  our technologies  due  todiffering business practices or (4) if contract models utilized by 
an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; 
•we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines ofbusiness and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;
 
•we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced, delivered and supported differently,which could cause customer confusion and delays;
 
•we  may  incur  higher  than  anticipated  costs  (1)  to  support,  develop  and  deliver  acquired  products  or  services,  (2)  for  general  and  administrativefunctions that support new business models, or (3) to comply with regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we
had anticipated;
 
•we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed onus
 by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integrationplans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integrati
on and restructuring expenses;25

•we may be u nable  to obtain required  approvals from governmental authorities under  competition  and  antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all,which
 could,  among  other  things,  (1)  delay  or  prevent  us  from  completing  a  transaction,  (2)  adversely  affect  our  integration plans  in  certainjurisdictions,
 (3)  restrict  our  ability  to  realize  the  expected  financial  or  strategic  goals  of  an  acquisition,  or  (4)  have  other  adverse  effects  on  ourcurrent business and operations;
 
•our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including (1) stock repurchases, (2) dividend payments and (3)retirement of outstanding indebtedness, among others;
 
•we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition andwe may
 have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timelymanner or on favorable terms;
 
•to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted andearnings per share may decrease; and
 
•we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles, including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition.
The
 occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly inthe case of a larger acquisition or sever
al concurrent acquisitions.Our
 hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.     Our hardware business may adversely affect our overall profitability.We
 may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to anumber of factors, including:
 
•our changes in hardware strategies, offerings and technologies which could adversely affect demand for our hardware products; 
•our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and license business; 
•our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and the de-emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products couldadversely affect our hardware revenues;
 
•changes  in  strategies  and  frequency  for  the  development  and  introduction  of  new  versions  or  next  generations  of  our  hardware  products  couldadversely affect our hardware revenues;
 
•a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results, such as potential write-downs and impairments of our inventories;higher
 warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses; and amortization and potential impairment ofintangible assets associated with our hardware business;
 
•decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives could adversely affect ourhardware revenues; and
 
•we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1) operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operatingmargins
 than  our  own;  (2)  have  different  legacy  business  practices  and  go-to-market  strategies  than  our  own  that  we  may  alter  as  a  part  of  ourintegration
 efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company; (3) leverage different platformsor
 competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4) utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability toscale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations.

Our
 hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of our hardware business will suffer.     Wedepend
 on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the nece ssary  technologies and components for our hardware products, and thereare
 some  technologies  and  components  that  can  only  be  purchased  from  a  single  vendor  due  to  price,  quality,  technology,  availability  or  other  businessconstraints.
 As  a  result,  our  supp ly  chain  operations  could  be  disrupted  or  negatively  impacted  by  industry  consolidation  and  component  constraints  orshortages,
 natural disasters, political unrest, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the  countries or regionswhere
 these  single  source  component  vendors  are  located  or  where  the  products  are  being  shipped.  We  may  be  unable  to  purchase  these  items  from  therespective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience signific
ant shortag es, delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technolog ies, parts orcomponents from a particular vendor. If one or more of
 the risks described above occurs, our hardware business and related operating results could be materiallyand adversely 
affected . We are
 susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.     We outsource the manufacturing,assembly,
 delivery and technology or component design of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside theU.S.
 If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products, we may not be able to find alternate manufacturingsources
 in  a  timely  or  cost-effective  manner,  if  at  all.  Therefore,  we  continue  to  explore  additional  third-party  manufacturing  partners  to  drive  supply  chaincontinuity. This
 could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses,all of which could adversely affect the margins 
of our hardware business.These
 challenges  and  risks  also  exist  when  we  acquire  companies  with  hardware  products  and  related  supply  chain  operations.  In  some  cases,  we  may  bedependent,
 at least initially, on these acquired companies’ supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react tothese challenges and risks.
Our
 cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results.     Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channelnetwork
 is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integratorsand
 independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketingand
 sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channelparticipants
 were  to  deteriorate,  if  any  of  our  competitors  enter  into  strategic  relationships  with  or  acquire  a  significant  channel  participant,  if  the  financialcondition
 or  operations  of  our  channel  participants  were  to  weaken  or  if  the  level  of  demand  for  our  channel  participants’  products  and  services  were  todecrease. There
 can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are notsuccessful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.
We
 may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.     We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,controls
 and  contractual  commitments  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights.  Despite  our  efforts,  these  protections  may  be  limited.  Unauthorized  thirdparties
 may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may beinvalida
ted, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with thescope
 of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as dothe
 laws and courts of the U.S. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may notremain competitive.

Third parties
 have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property righ ts and/or  breach of license agreement provisions. 
   We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rightsand/or
 breach of our agreements with them. These  third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute productsor
 services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property thr ough  asserting claims ofinfringement and misuse. We expect to continue to receive such claims as:
 
•we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies; 
•the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; 
•the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; 
•the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and 
•non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:
 
•be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; 
•divert management’s time and attention from developing our business; 
•require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; 
•require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; 
•require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; 
•require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or 
•otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.We
 may  not  receive significant  revenues from  our  current research and  development efforts  for  several  years,  if  at  all.     Developing  our various  productofferings
 is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of ourcorporate
 strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities boththrough
 internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. Accelerated product and service introductionsand
 short life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenueincreases.
 We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitiveposition. However, we do not expect to
 receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.Business disrupt
ions could adversely affect our operating results.     A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographicareas,
 some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S.We
 are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, includingsome of
 our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes. A major earthquake or fire,political,
 social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increasedstorm severity, drought and
 pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability toconduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be material
ly and adversely affected.28

Adverse
 litigation results could affect our business.     We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to ouroperations, and can divert our management’s attention away from
 running our core business. The results of our litigation als o cannot be predicted with certainty.An
 adverse  decision  could  result  in  monetary  damages  or  injunctive  relief  that  could  affect  our  business,  operating  results  or  financial  condition.  Additionalinformation 
regarding certain  of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note  17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere inthis Annual report 
. We
 may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.     As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in boththe
 U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potentialchanges
 in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws. Manyjudgments
 are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities,which
 often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impacton our tax rate.
Increasingly,
 countries  around  the  world  are  actively  considering  or  have  enacted  changes  in  relevant  tax,  accounting  and  other  laws,  regulations  andinterpretat
ions. In particular, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the U.S., which has had andwe
 expect will continue to have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes. Due to the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act,we
 made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2018. The U.S. TreasuryDepartment
 and the Internal revenue Service (IrS), and other standards-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be appliedthat
 is  different  from  our  interpretation.  The  Tax  Act  requires  complex  computations  not  previously  required  or  produced,  and  significant  judgments  andassumptions
 in the interpretation of the law were made in producing our provisional estimates. We have adjusted the provisional amounts and reflected theadjustments in our
 financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2019 based on the regulatory and other guidance issued to date by the Treasury Departmentand
 IrS,  but  also  on  judgments  and  assumptions  where  uncertainty  continues  to  exist.  Such  uncertainty  in  the  application  of  the  Tax  Act  to  our  ongoingoperations
 as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the U.S. political environment could have an adverse impact on our futuretax rate.
Other
 countries  also  continue  to  consider  enacting  changes  to  their  tax  laws  that  could  adversely  affect  us  by  increasing  taxes  imposed  on  our  foreignsubsidiaries,
 including  changes  in  withholding  tax  regimes  and  the  imposition  of  taxes  targeted  at  certain  technology  businesses.  More  fundamentally,longstanding
 international  tax  principles  that  determine  each  country’s  right  to  tax  cross-border  transactions  are  being  reconsidered,  creating  significantuncertainty
 as to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operations. This re-examination is driven by a perceived need to provide greatertaxing
 rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located. Various measures are being discussed, including adjustments to transfer pricing rules,limitations on deductions, and imposition of additi
onal withholding taxes.As a
 part of our income tax structure, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations made in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate taxdetermination
 is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IrS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likelybe
 subject to additional audits in the future. Although we have negotiated a number of agreements with certain taxing jurisdictions, these agreements do notcover
 substantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious.Similarly,
 certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law. In addition, our provision for incometaxes
 could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory tax rates to those in which the rates arerelatively higher.
29

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
We
 are also subject to non-income b ased  taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. andvarious
 foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged. Although we believe that our  income and non-incomebased
 tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected inour historical income tax provisi
ons and accruals . Charges
 to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.      Under business combination accounting standards pursuant toAccounting
 Standards  Codification  (ASC)  805, Business 
Combinations
,  we  recognize  the  identifiable  assets  acquired,  the  liabilities  assumed  and  any  non-controlling
 interests  in  acquired  companies  generally  at  their  acquisition  date  fair  values  and,  in  each  case,  separately  from  goodwill.  Goodwill  as  of  theacquisition date is measured as the
 excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition dateamounts
 of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable butwhich are
 inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating resultsand may adversely affect our cash flows:
 
•costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeploymentor relocation expenses;
 
•impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets; 
•amortization of intangible assets acquired; 
•a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; 
•identification  of,  or  changes  to,  assumed  contingent  liabilities,  both  income  tax  and  non-income  tax  related,  after  our  final  determination  of  theamounts
 for  these  contingencies  or  the  conclusion  of  the  measurement  period  (generally  up  to  one  year  from  the  acquisition  date),  whichevercomes first;
 
•charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activitiesfor
 a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructureour operations or to reduce our cost structure;
 
•charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and 
•charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.Substantia
lly all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the periods in which those costs are incurred.Charges
 to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and theextent
 of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the “Critical AccountingPolicies
 and Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations (Item 7) included elsewhere in thisAnnual report.
There
 are  risks  associated  with  our  outstanding  and  future  indebtedness.     As  of  May  31,  2019,  we  had  an  aggregate  of  $56.3  billion  of  outstandingindebtedness
 that will mature between calendar year 2019 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to payinterest
 and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to servicesuch debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able
 to manage any of these risks successfully.30

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
We
 may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or t hat the terms
 of  any  refinancing  may  not  be  as  favorable  as  the  terms  of  our  existing  debt.  Furthermore,  if  prevailing  interest  rates  or  other  factors  at  the  time  ofrefinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense re 
lating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Should we
 incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited,which
 could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit ratingcould
 negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. Theserisks could adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations.Environmental
 and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.     Some  of our cloudand
 hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materialsused for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well
 as local testing and labellingrequirements.
 Compliance  with  these  ever-changing  environmental  and  other  laws  in  a  timely  manner  could  increase  our  product  design,  development,procurement,
 manufacturing,  delivery,  cloud  operations  and  administration  costs,  limit  our  ability  to  manage  excess  and  obsolete  non-compliant  inventory,change
 our  sales  activities,  or  otherwise  impact  future  financial  results  of  our  cloud  and  hardware  businesses.  Any  violation  of  these  laws  can  subject  us  tosignificant
 liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in amaterial
 adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses. regulatory, market, and competitive pressuresregarding the energy intensity and energy mix for our data center operations m
ay also grow.The
 SEC has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supplychain
 is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end-products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refiningof
 any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited. Ourrelationships
 with  customers  and  suppliers  could  suffer  if  we  are  unable  to  describe  our  products  as  “conflict-free.”  We  may  also  face  increased  costs  incomplying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements.
A
 significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on restriction of HazardousSubstances
 (roHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for ControllingPollution
 Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU,China
 and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The cumulative impact ofinternational environmental legislation could be s
ignificant.Our
 stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.    All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. Thetiming
 of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitionsor major transactions could
 also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price. Ourstock price could also be affected by factors, some of 
which are beyond our control, including, among others: speculation in the press and the analyst community,changes
 in  recommendations  or  earnings  estimates  by  financial  analysts,  changes  in  investors’  or  analysts’  valuation  measures  for  our  stock,  earningsannouncements
 where  our  financial  results  differ  from  our  guidance  or  investors’  expectations,  our  credit  ratings  and  market  trends  unrelated  to  ourperformance.
 A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs anddivert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.

Our Board of
 Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 17, 2018 and February 15, 2019, we announcedthat our
 Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion. As of May 31, 2019, approximately $5.8 billion remainedavailable for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Our
 stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capitalneeds, our
 cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economicand
 market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
The
 following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yetbe purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:

Selecte d Financial Data The
 following table sets forth selected financial data as of and for our last five fiscal years. This selected financial data should be read in conjunction with theconsolidated
 financial  statements  and  related  notes  included  in  Item  15  of this  Annual  report.  Over  our  last  five  fiscal  years,  we have  acquired  a number  ofcompanies,
 including NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) in fiscal 2017. The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statementssince their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings per share and total 
assets.

Our net  income and diluted earnings per share were impacted in fiscal 2019 and 2018 by the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions of the Tax Actas applicable to u
s are described below under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”.(2)
Working  capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partiallyoffset
 by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all of the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periodspresented
 primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0billion
 in fiscal 2018, and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividendpayments
 in the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented. In addition, our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussedfurther below.
(3)
Our  notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported perour
 consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable andother
 borrowings increased between fiscal 2015 and 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017issuance
 of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion, and the fiscal 2016 short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included els
ewhere in this Annual report for additional information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings.(4)

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations We
 begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. Thisoverview
 is  followed  by  a  summary  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  believe  are  important  to  understanding  the  assumptions  andjudgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed ana
lysis of our results of operations and financial condition.Business Overview
Oracle
 provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  applications  andinfrastructure
 offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premisedeployments, cloud-based
 deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our OracleCloud
 at  Customer  offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  andfacilitate
 the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, governmentagencies,
 educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle PartnerNetwork.
We
 have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as apart
 of  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  results  of  Operations  and  the  information  contained  within  Note  15  of  Notes  toConsolidated
 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segmentsand
 align as to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view our operatingresults and allocate resources.
Cloud and License Business
Our
 cloud and license line of business, which represented 83%, 81% and 80% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, markets, sells anddelivers a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings.
Cloud services and license support revenues include:
 
•license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support servicesin
 connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments.Substantially
 all  license  support  customers  renew  their  support  contracts  with  us  upon  expiration  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from  technicalsupport
 services  and  the  periodic  issuance  of  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements,  which  current  license  support  customers  are  entitled  toreceive.
 License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise
 license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and aregenerally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual peri
od that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and 
•cloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deploymentmodels
 that  Oracle  develops,  provides  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements  for,  hosts,  manages  and  supports  and  that  customers  access  byentering
 into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed inadvance
 of  the  cloud  services  being  performed;  have  durations  of  one  to  three  years;  are  generally  renewed  at  the  customer’s  option;  and  aregenerally
 recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloudservices are consumed over time.

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
Cloud
 license  and on-premise  license  revenues  include  revenu es  from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database,Oracle
 Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise l 
icense  transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available tothe
 customer to download and use. revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licen ses  and on-premise licenses are recognized at thepoint
 in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues dueto
 the point in time for revenue recognition of  license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services andlicense
 support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise licens e  customers havethe option to purchase 
and renew license support contracts, as described above . Providing choice and
 flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of ourcorporate
 strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services hasincreased.
 To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applications  andinfrastructure
 licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for theirexisting workloads. We expect these trends to continue.
Our
 cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmentalbudgetary
 constraints;  the  strategy  for  and  competitive  position  of  our  offerings;  our  acquisitions;  the  continued  renewal  of  our  cloud  services  and  licensesupport
 customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with theirlicense
 purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloudservices sold; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and l
icense revenues generally will continue to increase due to: 
•expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; 
•continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and 
•contributions from our acquisitions.We
 believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments inresearch and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services.
Our
 cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historicalupward
 trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixedin
 the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year isprimarily
 due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably;the
 renewal  of  existing  customers’  cloud  services  and  license  support  contracts  over  the  course  of  each  fiscal  year  that  we  generally  recognize  as  revenuesratably; and the historical upward trend
 of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery, overthose four quarterly periods.
Hardware Business
Our
 hardware business, which represented 9%, 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, provides a broad selection ofhardware
 products  and  hardware-related  software  products  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware,  operatingsystems, virtualization,
37

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
management and
 other hardware related software, and related  hardware support. Each hardware  product and its related software, such  as an operating systemor
 firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at t
he point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership istransferred
 to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to impro ve  existing hardware products and services and to developnew
 hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added
 resellers.  Our  hardware  support  offer ings  provide  customers  with  unspecified  software  updates  for  software  components  that  are  essential  to  thefunctionality of our hardware products
 and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include produ ct repairs, maintenance
 services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generallypriced
 as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as r evenues  ratably as the hardware support services are delivered overthe contractual 
terms . We
 generally  expect  our  hardware  business  to  have  lower  operating  margins  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  than  our  cloud  and  license  business  due  to  theincremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.
Our
 quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affectedby,
 among others: our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware productsrelative
 to  competitor  offerings;  customer  demand  for  competing  offerings,  including  IaaS;  the  strength  of  general  economic  and  business  conditions;governmental budgetary constraints; whet
her customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware productsale;
 the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products,which
 have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade theirexisting hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are
 available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreign currency rate fluctuations . Services Business
Our
 services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 and 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, helps customersand
 partners  maximize  the  performance  of  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies.  We  believe  that  our  services  aredifferentiated
 based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property, and best practices. Our services offeringsinclude
 consulting services, advanced customer support services and education services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license andhardware businesses
. Our services revenues are impacted by, among others: our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand forour
 cloud  and  license  and  hardware  offerings  and  the  associated  services  for  these  offerings;  certain  of  our  acquisitions;  general  economic  conditions;governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; and tighter controls over customer discretionary spending.
Acquisitions
Our
 selective  and  active  acquisition  program  is  another  important  element  of  our  corporate  strategy.  In  recent  years,  we  have  invested  billions  of  dollars  toacquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017.
We
 expect  to  continue  to  acquire  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  in  furtherance  of  our  corporate  strategy.  Note  2  of  Notes  to  ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report provides additional inform
ation related to our recent acquisitions.We
 believe  that  we  can  fund  our  future  acquisitions  with  our  internally  available  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities,  cash  generated  fromoperations, additional borrowings or from
 the issuance of additional38

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
securities.
 We estimate the financial impact of any potential  acquisition  wit h  regard  to earnings,  operating  margin,  cash  flow and  return  on  invested  capitaltargets before deciding to move forward with an acquisiti
on.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  FinancialAccounting
 Standards Board’s (FASB), ASC, and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. Note 1 ofNotes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report includes a description of our significant accounting policies. GAAP, as setforth
 within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions as we apply our significant accounting policies. The accounting policiesthat
 reflect estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial resultsand for which we include additional discussion below are:
 
•revenue recognition; 
•Business Combinations; 
•Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; 
•Accounting for Income Taxes; and 
•Legal and Other Contingencies.Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies 
and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Revenue Recognition
The
 most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligationsand the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP
) for each performance obligation.Many
 of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within acustomer
 contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multipleproducts
 and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. Weallocate
 the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below)for
 each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customercontract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered.
We
 use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses,we
 are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. Wetypically
 establish  an  SSP  range  for  our  products  and  services,  which  is  reassessed  on  a  periodic  basis  or  when  facts  and  circumstances  change.  SSP  for  ourproducts
 and  services  can  evolve  over  time  due  to  changes  in  our  pricing  practices  that  are  influenced  by  intense  competition,  changes  in  demand  for  ourproducts
 and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, assubstantially
 all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contractsare
 generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise
 licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and arepresentative
 SSP  is  not  discernible  from  past  transactions  or  other  observable  evidence.  As  a  result,  the  SSP  for  a  cloud  license  and  an  on-premise  licenseincluded in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by 
applying a residual approach whereby all other performance39

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
obligations
 within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues 
. Business Combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, 
Business
Combinations
 , in accounting for our acquisitions . ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertainsto
 an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conductedand
 managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individualassets
 and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assetsacquired
 and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferredover
 the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accuratelyvalue
 assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  where  applicable,  our  estimates  are  inherentlyuncertain and subject
 to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustmentsto
 the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determinationof
 the  values  of  assets  acquired  or  liabilities  assumed,  whichever  comes  first,  any  subsequent  adjustments  are  recorded  to  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations.
Accounting
 for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including ourestimates
 for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although webelieve that the
 assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience andinformation
 obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur thatmay affect the accuracy or validity 
of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.For
 a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition
 contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as apart of the fair value estimates 
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.If
 we  cannot  reasonably  determine  the  fair  value  of  a  non-income  tax  related  pre-acquisition  contingency  by  the  end  of  the  measurement  period,  which  isgenerally
 the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an assetexisted
 or  a  liability  had  been  incurred  at  the  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  themeasurement
 period,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  such  contingencies  will  affect  earnings  and  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  andfinancial position.
In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of theacquisition
 date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to ourprelimina
ry estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determinationof the
 tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances willaffect
 our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
— Impairment AssessmentsWe
 review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We makecertain
 judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each ofour reporting units.

udgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, andother
 factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerat ions,  macroeconomic  conditions,  and  other  relevant  events  and  factors  affecting  thereporting
 unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis 
then performed . Determining the fair value of
 a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others,revenue
 growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions,and the determination of appropriate market comparables.
We
 make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairmentmay
 exist.  In  such  situations,  we  are  required  to  evaluate  whether  the  net  book  values  of  our  finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable.  We  determinewhether
 finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable  based  upon  the  forecasted  future  cash  flows  that  are  expected  to  be  generated  by  the  lowest  levelassociated
 asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective andinclude,
 among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by avariety
 of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internalforecasts.
Accounting for Income T
axesJudgment
 is  required  in  determining  our  worldwide  income  tax  provision.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  a  global  business,  there  are  many  transactions  andcalculations
 where  the  ultimate  tax  outcome  is  uncertain.  Some  of  these  uncertainties  arise  as  a  consequence  of  revenue  sharing  and  cost  reimbursementarrangements
 among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregationof
 foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of thesematters
 could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on ourincome tax provision and net income in the period in 
which such determination is made.We record a valuation allo
wance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferredtax
 assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth,forecasted
 earnings,  future  taxable income,  the  mix of earnings  in the  jurisdictions  in which  we  operate, historical earnings,  taxable income in prior  years, ifcarryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a v
aluation allowance. In the event we were todetermine
 that  we  would  not  be  able  to  realize  all  or  part  of  our  net  deferred  tax  assets  in  the  future,  an  adjustment  to  the  deferred  tax  assets  valuationallowance
 would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of thevaluati
on allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assetswould
 be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes atsuch time.
We 
calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returnsfiled
 during  the  subsequent  year.  Adjustments  based  on  filed  returns  are  generally  recorded  in  the  period  when  the  tax  returns  are  filed  and  the  global  taximplications are known, which can materiall
y impact our effective tax rate.The
 amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Ourestimate of
 the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax relatedcontingencies
 assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not apart of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues

pursuant to
 ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected  to be taken in atax
 return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in anaudit,
 including resolution of any related appeals or litiga tion  processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than50%
 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with
 respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as theclosing
 of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of ea rnings  or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that thefinal
 outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period inwhich
 such  a  determina tion  is  made.  Our  provisions  for  income  taxes  include  the  impact  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are  consideredappropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We
 are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure.
 A  description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  is  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potentialloss
 from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  both  thedetermination
 of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to thesematters,
 accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassessthe
 potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities couldhave a material impact on our results
 of operations and financial position.Results of Operations
Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
The
 comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31,2019 relative to May 31,
 2018, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was effective for us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018.Information
 regarding  our  adoption  and  the  impacts  of  the  Tax  Act  are  included  in  Notes  1  and  14  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  includedelsewhere in this Annual report.
Impacts of Acquisitions
The
 comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was impacted by our recent acquisitions. In our discussion of changes in ourresults
 of operations from fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services revenues (for theone-year
 period  subsequent  to  the  acquisition  date)  to  certain  of  our  businesses’  revenues  where  such  qualitative  discussions  would  be  meaningful  for  anunderstanding
 of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related tosuch
 acquired products and services. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be separatelyidentifiable
 due  to  the  integration  of  these  businesses  into  our  existing  operations,  and/or  were  insignificant  to  our  results  of  operations  during  the  periodspresented.

We
 caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified  amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends,any acquisition information that we prov
ide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: 
•any  qualitative  and  quantitative  disclosures  cannot  specifically  address  or  quantify  the  substantial  effects  attributable  to  changes  in  businessstrategies,
 including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces hadnot been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have
 been different; and 
•the amounts shown as cloud services and license support deferred revenues in our “Supplemental Disclosure related to Certain Charges” (presentedbelow) are not necessarily indicative
 of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew.Presentation of Operating Segm
ent Results and Other Financial InformationIn
 our fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidatedexpenses
 and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantiallyall of the other expense items as presented in our conso
lidated statement of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.In
 addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 results of each our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which areour
 operating  segments  as  defined  pursuant  to  ASC  280, Segment 
Reporting
.  The  financial  reporting  for  our  three  businesses  that  is  presented  below  ispresented
 in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales andmarketing
 expenses  that  correspond  to  and  are  directly  attributable  to  each  of  our  three  businesses.  We  also  utilize  these  inputs  to  calculate  and  present  asegment margin for each business in the discussion below.
Consistent
 with  our  internal  management  reporting  processes,  the  below  operating  segment  presentation  includes  revenues  adjustments  related  to  cloudservices
 and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized inour
 consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. refer to “Supplemental Disclosurerelated
 to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual
 report  for  a  reconciliation  of  the  summations  of  our  total  operating  segment  revenues  as  presented  in  the  discussion  below  to  total  revenues  aspresented per our consolidated statements of operations for al

 addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets,certain
 other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income, net and provision forincome
 taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses includingsuch
 items and/or it is impractical to do so. refer to “Supplemental Disclosure related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of theseitems
 and  Note  15  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  for  a  reconciliation  of  the  summations  of  totalsegment

A
 discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented below and the results for both fiscal2019
 and 2018 have been accounted for and presented to reflect our adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07, neither of which materially impacted our financialcondition
 or results of operations for fiscal 2019 or 2018. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared tofiscal

 the adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07. The adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2 017-07  did not have a material impact on the comparability of ourfinancial

. Constant Currency Present
ationOur
 international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As aresult,
 each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against majorinternational
 currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency ratefluctuations,
 we  compare  the  percent  change  in  the  results  from  one  period  to  another  period  in  this  Annual  report  using  constant  currency  disclosure.  Topresent this information, current
 and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars atconstant
 exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2018, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effectduring
 the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2019 and 2018, ourfinancial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.11 million in f
iscal 2019 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.16million in fiscal 2018 (using 1.16 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period).
 The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal2019
 results using the fiscal 2018 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we presentthe percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.

Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding
 the  effects  of  currency  rate  fluctuations,  our  total  revenues  increased  in  fiscal  2019  relative  to  fiscal  2018  due  to  growth  in  our  cloud  and  licenserevenues,
 partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license revenues duringfiscal
 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications andinfrastructure
 technologies  via  cloud  deployment  models  and  license  deployment  models  and  renewed  their  related  cloud  and  license  support  contracts  tocontinue
 to gain access to our latest technology and support services, and was also attributable to growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues.The
 constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were due to a reduction in our hardware products revenuesand
 hardware  support  revenues  primarily  due  to  the  emphasis  we  placed  on  the  marketing  and  sale  of  our  cloud-based  infrastructure  technologies,  whichresulted
 in  reduced  sales  volumes  of  certain  of  our  hardware  product  lines  and  also  impacted  the  volume  of  customers  that  purchased  hardware  supportcontracts.
 The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our consulting andeducation services revenues. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 40%, 33% and 27%, respectively, to the growth in our
fiscal 2019 total revenues.
Excluding
 the  effects  of  currency  rate  fluctuations,  our  total  operating  expenses  increased  during  fiscal  2019  relative  to  fiscal  2018  primarily  due  to  higherexpenses related to our cloud and license business, which resulted primarily from 
increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in ourcloud
 and license business’ revenues. This constant currency expense increase was partially offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal2018, primarily lower expenses related to our hardware
 business and lower restructuring expenses.In
 constant currency, our total operating margin increased during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues and total operatingmargin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat.

Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain
 ChargesTo
 supplement  our  consolidated  financial  information,  we  believe  that  the  following  information  is  helpful  to  an  overall  understanding  of  our  past  financialperformance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impacts of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations
in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information.
Our
 operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions andcertain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income:

(1)
In  connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, wedid
 not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entitiesupon
 delivery  of  the  contractual  obligations.  To  the  extent  customers  for  which  these  contractual  obligations  pertain  renew  these  contracts  with  us,  we  expect  to  recognize  revenues  for  the  fullcontracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.
(2)
Certain  acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business combination accountingrules
 generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do notreflect
 the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances asthough the acquired companies operated independ
ently in the periods presented.(3)

combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.(5)
restructuring expenses  during fiscal 2019 primarily  related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2019 Oracle restructuring Plan (2019 restructuring Plan). restructuring expenses duringfiscal
 2018 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2017 Oracle restructuring Plan (2017 restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuringplans is provided in the dis
cussion below under “restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.46

Stock-based compensation was inc luded in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions):

  172    180  Acquisition related and other
  —    1  Total stock-based compensation
 $1,653   $1,607  
Stock-based
 compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting wasaccelerated generally upon termination of the employees
 pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.(7)
For  fiscal 2019 and 2018, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation,
 amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items; after excluding the effects of income tax reform (see footnote (8) below); and, for fiscal2019, after excluding a tax benefit arising fro
m the increase of a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure; resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.5% and 20.8% in fiscal2019 and 2018, respectively, instead of 9.7% and 71.1%, respectively, which
 represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations.(8)
The  income tax reform adjustments presented in the table above were due to the enactment of the Tax Act (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual report), which was effective for us in fiscal
 2018, and also due to subsequent income tax expense adjustments made pursuant to SAB 118 during fiscal 2019.Cloud and License Business
Our
 cloud  and  license  business  engages  in  the  sale,  marketing  and  delivery  of  our  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  through  various  deploymentmodels,
 including  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  offerings  and  license  support  offerings.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  delivercertain
 of  our  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  on  a  subscription  basis  via  cloud-based  deployment  models  that  we  develop,  provide  unspecifiedupdates
 and enhancements for, host, manage, upgrade and support. Our cloud services revenues are generally recognized over the contractual term, which isgenerally
 one  to  three  years,  or  in  the  case  of  usage  model  contracts,  as  the  cloud  services  are  consumed.  Cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenuesrepresent
 fees  earned  from  granting  customers  licenses,  generally  on  a  perpetual  basis,  to  use  our  database  and  middleware  and  our  applications  softwareproducts
 within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to thecustomer
 to download and use. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise
 licenses purchased and renewed by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which isgenerally
 one  year.  We  continue  to  place  significant  emphasis,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  on  direct  sales  through  our  own  sales  force.  We  alsocontinue
 to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services andlicense
 support  expenses,  and  sales and  marketing  expenses.  These  costs are  largely personnel  and  infrastructure  related including  the  cost  of providing  ourcloud
 services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketingprogram costs.

cial Information” above.Excluding
 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 due to growth inour
 cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and licensesupport services
 in recent periods, contributions from our recent acquisitions and increased cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency,our
 total applications revenues and our total infrastructure revenues each grew during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 as customers continued to deploy ourapplications
 technologies and infrastructure technologies through different deployment models that we offer that enable customer choice. The Americas regioncontributed
 43%, the EMEA region contributed 31% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 26% of the constant currency revenues growth for this business infiscal 2019.
In
 constant currency, total cloud and license expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to higher sales and marketing expenses and highercloud
 services and  license support  expenses, each  of which  increased primarily due  to higher  employee related expenses from higher headcount  and due  tohigher technology infrastructure expenses.

 effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license segment’s total margin increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due toincreased revenues, while total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to
 expenses growth.48

Hardware Business
Our
 hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware products. Eachhardware
 product  and  its related  software, such  as an  operating system or  firmware, are highly  interdependent  and  interrelated and  are accounted  for  as acombined
 performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardwareproduct
 and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues fromthe
 sale  of  hardware  support  contracts  purchased  and  renewed  by  our  customers  at  their  option  and  are  generally  recognized  as  revenues  ratably  as  thehardware
 support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirectchannels
 such  as  independent  distributors  and  value-added  resellers,  and  we  also  market  and  sell  our  hardware  products  through  our  direct  sales  force.Operating
 expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used toproduce
 these  products  by our internal manufacturing  operations or by third-party manufacturers,  warranty expenses  and the impact of periodic changes  ininventory
 valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost oflabor
 and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensationearned by our sales force for the sales 
of our hardware offerings.

 the  effects  of  currency  rate  fluctuations,  total  hardware  revenues  decreased  in  fiscal  2019  relative  to  fiscal  2018  due  to  lower  hardware  productsrevenues
 and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  lower  hardware  support  revenues.  The  decrease  in  hardware  products  revenues  in  fiscal  2019  relative  to  fiscal  2018  wasprimarily
 attributable  to  our  continued  emphasis  on  the  marketing  and  sale  of  our  cloud-based  infrastructure  technologies,  which  resulted  in  reduced  salesvolumes
 of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. This constant currencyhardware

Excluding
 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower hardwareproducts and support costs and lower sales and marketing employee related e

On a

,  which was primarily attributable to realized gains on the sale of certa in  marketable securities during fiscal 2018 , and lower interest income in fiscal 2019 primarily due 
to lower average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities  balances during fiscal 2019 . Provision
 for  Income  Taxes: Our  effective  income  tax  rates  for  each  of  the  periods  presented  were  the  result  of  the  mix  of  income  earned  in  various  taxjurisdictions
 that  apply  a  broad  range  of  income  tax  rates.  In  fiscal  2018,  the  Tax  Act  was  signed  into  law.  The  more  significant  provisions  of  the  Tax  Act  asapplicable
 to us are described above under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”. refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsincluded
 elsewhere in this Annual report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods belowand
 the  U.S. federal  statutory  income  tax rates that  were in effect  during  these  periods.  Future  effective  income tax rates  could  be adversely  affected  by anunfavorable
 shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax relatedlitigat

Provisi
on for income taxes decreased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the absence of the initial accounting charges related to the Tax Act thatwere

 the Tax Act in fiscal 2019; the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile during fiscal 2019; the favorable impact of a tax benefit arising from anincrease
 in a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure in fiscal 2019; and lower income before provision for income taxes infiscal
 2019. These decreases to our provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were partially offset both by lower excess tax benefits relatedto
 stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2019, and by less favorable changes in net unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities andother events in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018.

Working
 capital: The  decrease  in  working  capital  as  of  May  31,  2019  in  comparison  to  May  31,  2018  was  primarily  due  to  $36.1  billion  of  cash  used  forrepurchases
 of  our  common  stock,  the  reclassification  of  $4.5  billion  of  long-term  senior  notes  as  a  current  liability  and  cash  used  to  pay  dividends  to  ourstockholders
 during fiscal 2019. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the favorable effects to our net current assets resulting from our net incomeduring fiscal 2019 and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from stock option exercises.
Our working capital may be impacted by some
 or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.Cash,
 cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash  and  cash equivalents  primarily  consist  of deposits  held  at major  banks,  Tier-1 commercial  paper  andother securities with
 original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities andcertain
 other securities. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2019 in comparison to May 31, 2018 was primarily due to$36.1
 billion used for repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $4.5 billion of borrowings, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cashused for capital expenditures. These cash

 flows from operating activities: Our  largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal oftheir
 license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms,which
 are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services,hardware
 offerings and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costsrelated to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased f
acilities.Net
 cash  provided  by operating  activities  decreased  during  fiscal  2019  compared  to fiscal  2018  primarily  due  to certain  unfavorable  cash  changes  in workingcapital
 balances,  primarily  unfavorable  changes  associated  with  income  taxes  including  the  first  installment  payment  made  pursuant  to  the  transition  taxprovisions
 of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019 (see additional discussion of future installment payments pursuant to the Tax Act’s transition tax under “ContractualObligations” below).
Cash
 flows  from  investing  activities: The  changes  in  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  primarily  relate  to  our  acquisitions,  the  timing  of  our  purchases,maturities
 and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to supportour growth.

 cash  provided  by  investing  activities  was  $26.6  billion  during  fiscal  2019  compared  to  $5.6  billion  of  net  cash  used  for  investing  during  fiscal  2018.  Theincrease in
 net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of, and a decrease in purchases of,marketable securities and other investments.
Cash
 flows  from  financing  activities: The  changes  in  cash  flows  from  financing  activities  primarily  relate  to  borrowings  and  repayments  related  to  our  debtinstruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee st
ock programs.Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased stock repurchases as

Free cash flow: 
To supplement our statements of  cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis toanal 
yze  cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with ourcompetitors.
 The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an  alternative to net income as an indicator of ourperformance, or as an alternative to cash fl

Long-Term
 Customer  Financing: We  offer  certain  of  our  customers  the  option  to  acquire  licenses,  cloud  services,  hardware  and  services  offerings  throughseparate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell
 these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutionswithin
 90  days  of  the  contracts’  dates  of  execution.  We  generally  record  the  transfers  of  amounts  due  from  customers  to  financial  institutions  as  sales  offinancing receivables because we are considered to
 have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.0 billion in fiscal 2019, $1.5 billion in2018
 and $912 million in fiscal 2017, respectively, or approximately 17%, 25% and 14%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues infiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Recent Financing Activities:
Cash
 Dividends :  In fiscal 2019, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.81 per share that totaled $2.9 billion. In June 2019, our Board of Directors declared aquarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding comm
on stock payable on July 31, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July17,
 2019.  Future  declarations of dividends  and  the establishment of future record  and  payment dates are subject  to the  final determination of our Board ofDirectors.
Common Stock
 repurchase Program: Our  Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 17, 2018and
 February 15, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $24.0 billion. As ofMay
 31, 2019, approximately $5.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 733.8 millionshares
 for  $36.0  billion,  238.0  million  shares  for  $11.5  billion,  and  85.6  million  shares  for  $3.5  billion  in  fiscal  2019,  2018  and  2017,  respectively.  Our  stockrepurchase
 authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, ourcash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market
conditions.
 Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchaseprogram may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

 also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitmentsare
 based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particularpart

such
 claims  and  obligations  have  been  excluded  from  the  contractual  obligations  table  above  due  to  the  uncertainty  o f  claims  and  legal  proceedings  andassociated
 estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this An 
nual report includes additional information regarding these contingencies. We
 believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,capital
 expenditures  and  contractual  obligation  requirements.  In  addition,  we  believe  that  we  could  fund  our  future  acquisitions,  dividend  payments  andrepurchases
 of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additionalborrowings or from the issuance of additional

Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options
Our stock-based compensation program
 is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees andalign their interests with the interests of exist
ing stockholders.We
 recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awardsgranted
 while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2016 has been aweighted-average
 annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awardsor stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and

stock
 options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximumpotential
 dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options ar e  exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2019,which
 generally have a ten-year exercise period, approximately 23 % have exercise prices higher than  the market price of our common stock on such date. Inrecent
 years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify thelevels of our stock
 repurchases in the future depending on a  number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends,to
 repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As  of May  31, 2019, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restric ted  stock-basedawards
 and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and  including stock options where the strikeprice is higher than the market price as of such date 
, was 9.6 % .During
 fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants toselected
 employees;  all  stock-based  award  grants  to  senior  officers;  and  any  individual  grant  of  restricted  stock  units  of  62,500  or  greater.  The  annualorganization-wide
 stock-based award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day periodfollowing
 the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Each member of a separate executive officer committee,referred
 to  as the  Plan Committee, was  allocated a  fiscal 2019  equity  budget  that  could  be  used  throughout  the  fiscal year  to grant  equity  within his  or herorganization, subject to certain limitations establ

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and
 Interest Income RiskCash,
 cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $37.8 billion and $67.3 billion as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our bank deposits and timedeposits
 are  generally  held  with  large,  diverse  financial  institutions  worldwide  with  high  investment-grade  credit  ratings  or  financial  institutions  that  meetinvestment-grade ratings criteria, which we
 believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2019, substantially all of our marketablesecurities were high
 quality with approximately 33% having maturity dates within one year and 67% having maturity dates within one to four years (a descriptionof
 our  marketable  securities  held  is  included  in  Notes  3  and  4  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  and“Liquidity
 and  Capital  resources”  above).  We  held  a  mix  of  both  fixed  and  floating-rate  debt  securities.  Fixed  rate  securities  may  have  their  market  valuesadversely
 impacted as interest rates increase,  while floating rate securities  may produce  less income than expected  if interest rates fall. Due in part to thesefactors,
 our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in marketvalue due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classif
y our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes ininterest
 rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if 
interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31, 2019 and 2018we
 estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $128 million and $308 million, respectively. We generallydo not use our investments for trading purposes.
Changes
 in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal2019
 and  2018,  total  interest  income  was  $1.1  billion  and  $1.2  billion,  respectively,  with  our  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  investmentsyielding an average 2.08% and 1.73%, respectively, on a worldwide basis.
Interest Expense Risk
Interest Expense Risk 
— Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsOur total borrowings wer
e $56.3 billion as of May 31, 2019, consisting of $55.4 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $750 million of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-rate Notes) and $113 million of other borrow
ings. As of May 31, 2019, we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifyingthe
 fixed-interest obligations associated with our $2.0 billion of 2.25% fixed-rate senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes) and our $1.5 billion of2.80%
 fixed-rate senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes), so that the fixed-rate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based onLIBOr.
 We have also entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our €750million
 of 3.125% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2025 Notes (July 2025 Notes) by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including theannual interest payments and the
 payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swapagreements match the critical term
s of the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notionalamounts
 and maturity dates. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedgespursuant
 to ASC 815, Derivatives 
and
Hedging
(ASC  815). The fair values of our outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2019and
 2018 were a $17 million net loss and a $26 million net loss, respectively. We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements duringfiscal
 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to an increase in forward interest rate prices. If LIBOr-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basispoints as of May 31, 2019 and 2018,
 the change would have decreased the collective fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $90 million and $315million, respectively.

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
By
 issuing the Floating-rate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based
 upon LIBOr. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. Aninterest
 rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing  estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest
 rates. As of May 31, 2019 and 2018, if LIBOr-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased ourinterest
 expense a nnually  by approximately $ 52 million and $86 million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements andfloating-rate
 borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes  7 and 10 of Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report 
. Currency Risk
Foreign Currency Trans
action Risk — Foreign Currency Forward ContractsWe
 transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated
 with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or
 decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolati
lity associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany
 sublicense  fees,  intercompany  loans  and  other  intercompany  transactions.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  generally  short-term  induration.
We
 neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant toASC
 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalues
 recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant.The
 balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealizedgain
 position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair valuesof these forward contracts is non-operating income, net for both rea
lized and unrealized gains and losses.We expect that we will continue to realiz
e gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forwardcontracts.
 Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactionsthat
 we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currencyforward
 contracts and other factors. The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major internationalcurrencies were $3.8 billion and $3.4
 billion as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollarsin
 exchange  for  other  major  international  currencies  were  $3.3  billion  and  $1.4  billion  as  of  May  31,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  The  fair  values  of  ouroutstanding
 foreign  currency  forward  contracts  were  nominal  at  May  31,  2019  and  2018.  Net  foreign  exchange  transaction  losses  included  in  non-operatingincome,
 net  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations  were  $111  million,  $74  million  and  $152  million  in  fiscal  2019,  2018  and  2017,respectively.
 As  a  large  portion  of  our  consolidated  operations  are  international,  we  could  experience  additional foreign  currency  volatility in  the  future,  theamounts and timing of which are unknown.
Foreign Currency T
ranslation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesFluctuations
 in  foreign  currencies  impact  the  amount  of  total  assets  and  liabilities  that  we  report  for  our  foreign  subsidiaries  upon  the  translation  of  theseamounts
 into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion ofthe
 cash  held  by  these  subsidiaries  is  subject  to  translation  variance  caused  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  as  of  the  end  of  each  respectivereporting period (the offset to which is substantially
 recorded to accumulated other60

comprehensive
 loss on  our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income includedelsewhere in this Annual report).
As
 the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2019, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthat we
 reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2019 decreased relative to what we would have reportedusing
 a constant currency rate from May 31, 2018. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes onour
 reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars was a decrease of $158 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $57 million for fiscal 2018 and adecrease of
 $86 million in fiscal 2017. If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as ofMay
 31,  2019  and  May  31,  2018  the  amount  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  we  would  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  would  have  decreased  byapproximately $434 million and $555 million, respectively, assuming constant fore
ign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.Item 8.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Di
sclosure Controls and ProceduresAs
 of the end of the period covered by this Annual report on Form 10-k, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of ourDisclosure Committee and
 our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of thedesign and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).
Based on
 our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers, one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), as of the end ofthe
 period covered by this report, our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2019to
 provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  us  in  reports  that  we  file  or  submit  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  (i)  recorded,processed,
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management,including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom 
is our Principal Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s 
Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management
 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act rules13a-15(f)
 and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is ourPrincipal
 Financial Officer), we conducted  an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2019 based on theguidelines
 established  in Internal 
Control—Integrated
Framework
issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission’s  2013framework.
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the preparation of financial statements for externa
l reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Based
 on  the  results  of  our  evaluation,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  May  31,  2019.  Wereviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.

The
 effectiveness of our internal control over  financial reporting as of May 31, 201 9 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered publicaccounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual report.
Changes in Internal Contr
ol over Financial ReportingThere
 were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Actrules
 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controlover
 financial  reporting.  We  implemented  internal  controls  to  ensure  we  adequately  evaluated  our  contracts  and  properly  assessed  the  impact  of  the  newaccounting
 standard related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate its adoption on June 1, 2018. There were no significant changes toour internal control over financial reporting due to the 
adoption of the new standard.Inherent Limitations o
n Effectiveness of ControlsOur
 management, including our Principal Executive Officers (one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer), believes that our disclosure controls and proceduresand
 internal  control  over  financial  reporting  are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  their  objectives  and  are  effective  at  the  reasonableassurance
 level.  However,  our  management  does  not  expect  that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  willprevent
 all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that theobjectives
 of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits ofcontrols
 must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absoluteassurance
 that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
 can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts ofsome
 persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part uponcertain
 assumptions  about  the  likelihood  of  future  events  and  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  any  design  will  succeed  in  achieving  its  stated  goals  under  allpotential
 future  conditions;  over  time,  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  the  degree  of  compliance  with  policies  orprocedures
 may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not bedetected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Oracle CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We
 have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control— IntegratedFramework
 issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)(the  COSO  criteria).  In  our  opinion,  OracleCorporation (the Company) maintained, in a
ll material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of
 Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows foreach
 of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2019, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and ourreport June 21, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  ofinternal control over financial reporting included
 in the accompanying Management’s report on Internal Control Over Financial reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s interna
l control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare
 required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
 conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonableassurance about whether effective internal control over financial report
ing was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  andevaluating
 the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
 basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are beingmade only in
 accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timelydetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Oracle
 Corporation  provides  products  and  services  that  substantially  address  all  aspects  of  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments  includingapplications
 and  infrastructure,  which  are  delivered  to  customers  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and  interoperable  IT  deployment  models,  includingcloud-based,
 Cloud at Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer’s own data center), on premise or hybrid. Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service andInfrastructure-as-a-Service
 (SaaS  and  IaaS,  respectively,  and  collectively,  Oracle  Cloud  Services)  offerings  provide  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  stack  ofapplicati
ons and infrastructure services delivered via a cloud-based deployment model. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the software, hardware and services on acustomer’s behalf in
 a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer. We offer our customers the option todeploy
 our comprehensive  set of cloud offerings including  Oracle Cloud Services or to purchase  our software and hardware products  and  related services tomanage
 their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase license support contracts,which
 provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical supportassistance.
 Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updatesand can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of serv
ices offerings that are designedto improve customer utilization of
 their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.Oracle
 Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun inJune 1977.
Basis of Financial Statements
The
 consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positionsof
 certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s stockholders for allperiods
 presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore havebeen
 included as a component of non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have beeneliminated. 
Certain  other  prior  year  balances  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  year  presentation.  Such  reclassifications  did  not  affect  totalrevenues, operating income or net income.
In fiscal 2019, we adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates:

Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
The
 comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31,2019 relative to May 31,
 2018, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was effective for us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018.The
 Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; created a quasi-territorial tax system that generally allows companies to repatriatecertain
 foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. income tax for such earnings generated after December 31, 2017; generally required companiesto
 pay a one-time transition tax pursuant to a payment schedule that settles the tax over multiple future years on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generatedprior to
 December 31, 2017 that, in substantial part, were previously tax deferred; created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings; limited deductibility ofcertain future
 compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees; and provided tax incentives for the exportation of U.S. products to foreignjurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment, among other provisions. As a result, 
we recorded a provisional charge to income tax expense of$6.9
 billion in fiscal 2018, which, pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), included a $7.8 billion provisional charge related to the one-timetransition
 tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings and a provisional $911 million of income tax benefit related to the remeasurement of our net deferred taxassets
 and  liabilities.  During  fiscal  2019,  we  completed  our  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  the  Tax  Act  and  recorded  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $529  million  inaccordance with SAB 118 related to adjustments to our estimates of the one-time transiti
on tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings and an income tax expenseof $140 million in accordance with SAB 118 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred ta
x assets and liabilities . Use of Estimates
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  FinancialAccounting
 Standards  Board’s  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the  various  staff  accounting  bulletins  and  other  applicableguidance
 issued  by  the  SEC.  These  accounting  principles  require  us  to  make  certain  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the  estimates,judgments
 and  assumptions  upon  which  we  rely  are  reasonable  based  upon  information  available  to  us  at  the  time  that  these  estimates,  judgments  andassumptions
 are  made.  These  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  can  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities as  of  the  date  of  the  financialstatements as well as the reported amounts of
 revenues and expenses during the periods presented.74

—(Continued) May 31,

To
 t he  extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will beaffected.
 In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by  GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in itsapplication. There are also areas
 in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.Revenue Recognition
Our sources of revenues include:
 
•cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, which typicallyrepresent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;
 
•hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and
 
•services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting, advanced customer supportand education services.
License support
 revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by ourcustomers at
 their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patchesreleased
 during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical supportpersonnel.
 License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customerselect to renew their license support contracts annually.
Cloud
 services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (SaaS and IaaS, respectively, and collectively,Oracle
 Cloud Services) offerings which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies, respectively, via cloud-based deployment models that we developfunctionality
 for,  provide  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements  for,  host,  manage,  upgrade  and  support  and  that  customers  access  by  entering  into  asubscription agreemen
t with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensivesoftware
 and hardware management, maintenance and security services for customer cloud-based, on-premise or other IT infrastructure for a fee for a statedterm.
Cloud license and on-premise
 license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware,application
 and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. The vast majority of ourcloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.
revenues
 from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage,and
 industry-specific  hardware.  Our  hardware  support  offerings  generally  provide  customers  with  software  updates  for  the  software  components  that  areessential
 to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardw
are products fees.Our
 services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consultingservices
 are  designed  to  help  our  customers  to,  among  others,  deploy,  architect,  integrate,  upgrade  and  secure  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  andinfrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as 
a part of75

arrangements
 to customers buying other products and services. We offer these advanced customer support services to Oracle customers to enable increasedperformance
 and higher availability of Oracle products  and services. Education services include instruct or-led,  media-based and internet-based training in theuse of our cloud, software and hardware products.
Topic
 606  is  a  single  standard  for  revenue  recognition  that  applies  to  all  of  our  cloud,  license,  hardware  and  services  arrangements  and  generally  requiresrevenues
 to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers, reflecting the amount of consideration weexpect to receive for those goods or services. Pursuant to T
opic 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:  
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 
 
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 
 
•determination of the transaction price; 
 
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 
 
•recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.The
 timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accountsreceivable
 on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheetswhen
 revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices forcloud
 license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to thecustomer
 of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and IaaScontracts
 are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Mostcontracts
 that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed throughour
 financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating income, net within ourconsolidated statements of operations based on market r
ates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.  Our
 revenue  arrangements  generally  include  standard  warranty  or  service  level  provisions  that  our  arrangements  will  perform  and  operate  in  all  materialrespects
 as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Ourarrangements
 generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collectedfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

 cloud  services  throughout  the  contract  period.  revenues  from  cloud  services  provided  on  a  consumption  basis,  such  as  metered  services,  are  generallyrecognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.

 from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when  the software ismade

 made available to the royalty customer.Revenue
Recognition
for
Hardware
Products
The
 hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as acombined

have
Multiple
Performance
ObligationsMany
 of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracleproducts
 and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally notcombined.
 We  allocate  the  transaction  price  for  each  contract  to  each  performance  obligation  based  on  the  relative  standalone  selling  price  (SSP)  for  eachperformance obligation within each contract.
We
 use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses,we
 are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. Wetypically
 establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licensesand
 on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts atthe
 time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customerto
 access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products aresold
 for  a  broad  range  of  amounts  (that  is,  the  selling  price  is  highly  variable)  and  a  representative  SSP  is  not  discernible  from  past  transactions  or  otherobservable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise
 license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determinedby applying a residual approach whereby all 
other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon theirrespective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price 
allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.77

 receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidatedbalance sheets as of May 31, 2019 and 2018.
The
 amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2019 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2018 wasapproximately
 $8.3 billion. revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivableswere immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.  
remaining
 performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have beenissued
 to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in futureperiods.
 The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. Ineach
 fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our firstfiscal
 quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time. As of May 31, 2019, our remaining performanceobligations were $36.2 billion, approximately
 62% of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.refer to Note 15 for our discussion of revenues disaggregation.
Sales
of
Financing
Receivables
We
 offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term paymentcontracts.
 We  generally  sell  these  contracts  that  we  have  financed  for  our  customers  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  financial  institutions  within  90  days  of  thecontracts’
 dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we areconsidered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of
our financing receivables were sold to financial 
institutions.Business Combinations
We
 apply  the  provisions  of  ASC  805, Business 
Combinations
(ASC  805),  in  accounting  for  our  acquisitions.  ASC  805  requires  that  we  evaluate  whether  atransacti
on pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capableof
 being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisitionto
 the  individual  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  on  a  relative  fair  value  basis;  whereas  the  acquisition  of  a  business  requires  us  to  recognize  separately  fromgoodwill
 the  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  fair  values.  Goodwill  as  of  the  acquisition  date  is  measured  as  the  excess  ofconsideration
 transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates andassumptions
 to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, ourestimates
 are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisitiondate,
 we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurementperiod
 or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent  adjustments are recorded to ourconsolidated
 statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure  certain activities of an acquired  company or our internal operations are accounted  for astermination
 and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit
or

,  and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability forcosts associated with an exit or
 disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of78

 in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring ac tivities,  assumptions are applied regardingestimated sub-lease payments to be
 received, which can differ from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may affect our resultsof operations and financial position 
in the peri od the revision is made. For
 a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition
 contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as apart of the fair value estimates 
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine thefair
 value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of suchmatters,
 we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred atthe acquisition date and (2)
 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates ofsuch contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on 
our results of operations and financial position.In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of theacquisition
 date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to ourprelimina
ry estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determinationof the
 tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances willaffect
 our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financialposition.
Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
In
 accordance with ASC 320, Investments
 — Debt
and
Equity
Securities,
and  based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all ofour
 marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. Marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with all unrealized gains(losses)
 reflected  net  of  tax  in  stockholders’  equity  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  and  as  a  line  item  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensiveincome.
 If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in non-operating income, net inthe
 accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  We  periodically  evaluate  our  investments  to  determine  if  impairment  charges  are  required.Substantially
 all of our marketable debt  investments  are classified as current  based  on the nature  of the investments  and  their availability for use in currentoperations.
Investments
 in equity securities, other than equity method investments, are recorded at fair value, if fair value is readily determinable. We hold investments incertain
 non-marketable equity securities with no readily determinable fair values in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Uponadoption
 of ASU 2016-01 effective June 1, 2018, we have elected to measure these equity securities at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable pricechanges
 from  orderly transactions for  identical or similar investments  of the  same  issuer. Prior to  our adoption of ASU  2016-01  these  equity  securities wererecorded
 at cost, less any impairment. Our non-marketable equity securities are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balancesheets and are subject to periodic impairment reviews.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We
 apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair 
Value
Measurement
(ASC  820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant toother accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.
The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are
 included in Note 4.Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
We
 record  allowances for doubtful  accounts  based  upon  a specific  review  of all significant outstanding  invoices. For those invoices  not specifically reviewed,provisions
 are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivablewas
 recorded in and current economic trends. We  write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collectionefforts without success.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that
 are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivativesand
 trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure toany single financial institution. I
nvestment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities. Ourderivative
 contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses in thesecontracts
 is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contractsfluctuate
 from  contractually  established  thresholds.  We  generally  do  not  require  collateral  to  secure  accounts  receivable.  The  risk  with  respect  to  tradereceivable
s is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customercontracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer 
accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.We
 outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside theU.S.
 Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations wherethese
 third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for ourhardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business.
Inventories
Inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-outbasis.
 We  evaluate  our  ending  inventories  for  estimated  excess  quantities  and  obsolescence.  This  evaluation  includes  analysis  of  sales  levels  by  product  andprojections
 of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and chargedto
 hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete.At
 the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in therestoration
 or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balancesheets and totaled $320 million and $398 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Other Receivables
Other receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax
 receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables areincluded
 in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $776 million and $802 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018,respectively.
Deferred Sales Commissions
We
 defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support andhardware
 support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-linebasis
 over  a  period  of  benefit  that  we  estimate  to  be  four  to  five  years.  We  determine  the  period  of  benefit  by  taking  into  consideration  the  historical  andexpected
 durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relatingto
 our  cloud-based  arrangements  are  generally  deferred  and  then  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  related  contractual  renewal  period,  which  isgenerally
 one  to  three  years.  Amortization  of  deferred  sales  commissions  is  included  as  a  component  of  sales  and  marketing  expenses  in  our  consolidatedstatements of operations.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
 method  based  on estimated  useful  lives  of the  assets,  which  range  from  one to 40  years. Leasehold improvements  are amortized over the  lesser  of theestimated
 useful  lives  of  the  improvements  or  the  lease  terms,  as  appropriate.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  periodically  reviewed  for  impairmentwhenever
 events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  did  not  recognize  any  significantproperty impairment charges in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments
Goodwill
 represents  the  excess  of  the  purchase  price  in  a  business  combination  over  the  fair  value  of  net  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired.  Intangibleassets
 that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period weevaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of
 purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remainingperiods of amortization.
The
 carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets)
 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed forimpairment,
 we  have  the  option  to  perform  an  assessment  of  qualitative  factors  of  impairment  (optional  assessment)  prior  to  necessitating  a  quantitativeimpairment
 test.  Should  the  optional  assessment  be  used  for  any  given  fiscal  year,  qualitative  factors  to  consider  for  a  reporting  unit  include:  cost  factors;financial
 performance;  legal,  regulatory,  contractual,  political,  business,  or  other  factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations;macroecono
mic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likelythan not
 that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. Forthose
 reporting  units  tested  using  a quantitative  approach,  we compare  the  fair value  of each  reporting  unit  with the  carrying  amount  of the  reporting  unit,including
 goodwill. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows thereporting
 unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and marketconditions;
 and market comparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less thanthe carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to
 the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting81

unit. 
Our  most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1, 2019 and did not result  in a goodwill impairment charge . W e did not recognize impairment charge 
s in fiscal 2018 or 2017.recoverability
 of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset isexpected
 to generate. recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If theasset
 is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impairedasset.
 We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite livedintangible
 assets  and  may  adjust  the  period  over  which  these  assets  are  amortized  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  a  shorteramortization period is more
 reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows.Derivative Financial Instruments
During
 fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 10 below for additionalinformat
ion). We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives
and Hedging
(ASC 815), which  requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as ofeach
 reporting  date.  ASC  815  also  requires  that  changes  in  our  derivatives’  fair  values  be  recognized  in  earnings,  unless  specific  hedge  accounting  anddocumentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).
The
 accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  a  derivative  depends  on  the  intended  use  of  the  derivative  and  the  resulting  designation.  For  a  derivativeinstrument
 designated  as  a  fair  value  hedge,  loss  or  gain  attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  of  change  with  acorresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged.
For
 a  derivative  instrument  designated  as  a  cash  flow  hedge,  each  reporting  period  we  record  the  change  in  fair  value  of  the  derivative  to  AOCL  in  ourconsolidated balance sheets, and the change is reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We
 are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure.
 Descriptions  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  are  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for anestimated
 loss  if  the  potential  loss  from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably estimated.  Note  17  belowprovides additional information regarding certain of 
our legal contingencies.Shipping and Handling Costs
Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for al
l periods presented.Foreign Currency
We
 transact  business  in  various  foreign  currencies.  In  general,  the  functional  currency  of  a  foreign  operation  is  the  local  country’s  currency.  Consequently,revenues
 and  expenses  of  operations  outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  weighted-average  exchange  rates  while  assets  and  liabilities  ofoperations
 outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  exchange  rates  at  the  balance  sheet  dates.  The  effects  of  foreign  currency  translationadjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying

 exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accom panying  consolidated statements of operations were $ 111 million, $ 74 million and $1 
52 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Stock-Based Compensation
We
 account  for  share-based  payments  to  employees,  including  grants  of  service-based  restricted  stock  awards,  performance-based  restricted  stock  awards(PSUs),
 service-based employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance withASC
 718, Compensation
 — Stock
Compensation,
which  requires  that  share-based  payments  (to  the  extent  they  are  compensatory)  be  recognized  in  ourconsolidated statements of operations based on their fa
ir values. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.For
 our  service-based  stock  awards,  we  recognize  stock-based  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  service  period  of  the  award,  which  isgenerally four years.
For
 our PSUs and PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period(which is
 the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensationexpense
 is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets thatresult in a change
 in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-basedcompensation
 expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of sharesthat are expected to vest
 are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU or PSO tranche on a cumulative catchup
 basis  during  each  interim  reporting  period  in  which  such  estimates  are  altered.  Changes  in  estimates  of  the  implicit  service  periods  are  recognizedprospectively.
We record deferred tax assets
 for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based
 compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with abusiness combinat
ion at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions forstock-based
 awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stockoption
 is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for incometaxes in such period.
Advertising
All
 advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $169 million, $138 millionand $95 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Research and Development Costs and Software

Income Taxes
We
 account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income 
Taxes
(ASC  740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences oftemporary
 differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  amounts  recognized  for  income  tax  purposes.  Werecord a valuation allow
ance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A two-step approach is
 applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.The
 first  step  is  to  determine  if  the  weight  of  available  evidence  indicates  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  in  an  audit,including
 resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%likely to
 be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of ourconsolidated statements of operations.
During
 fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the accounting policy election required with regard to the Tax Act’s Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)provision.
 The FASB allows companies to adopt a policy election to account  for GILTI under one of two methods: (i) account  for GILTI as a component of taxexpense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules (the period cost method), 
or (ii) account for GILTI in a company’s84

ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2019 and 2018 Acquisitions
Fiscal 2018 Acquisition of Aconex Limited
On
 March 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Aconex Limited (Aconex), a provider of cloud-based collaboration software for construction projects. Wehave included
 the financial results of Aconex in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. These results were not individually material toour
 consolidated financial statements. The total purchase price for Aconex was approximately $1.2 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.2 billion in cashand $7
 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, werecorded
 approximately $873 million of goodwill, $377 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $29 million of net liabilities. Goodwill generated from ouracquisition of Aconex was primarily
 attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is not expected to be tax deductible.Other Fiscal 2019 and 2018 Acquisitions
During
 fiscal 2019 and 2018, we  acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our productsand services offerings 
. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements.85

Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions
Acquisition of NetSuite Inc., a Related 
PartyOn
 November  7,  2016,  we  completed  our  acquisition  of  NetSuite  Inc.  (NetSuite),  a  provider  of  cloud-based  enterprise  resource  planning  (ErP)  software  andrelated
 applications and a related party to Oracle. We acquired NetSuite to, among other things, expand our cloud SaaS offerings with a complementary set ofcloud ErP and related cloud software applications for
 customers.Lawrence
 J.  Ellison,  Oracle’s  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  Chief  Technology  Officer  and  Oracle’s  largest  stockholder,  was  an  affiliate  of  NetSuite’s  largeststockholder, NetSuit
e restricted Holdings LLC (a single member LLC investment entity whose interests are beneficially owned by a trust controlled by Mr. Ellison),which owned approximately 40% of the issued and outstanding NetSuite shares immediate
ly prior to the conclusion of the merger.The
 total purchase price for NetSuite was approximately $9.1 billion, which consisted of approximately $9.0 billion in cash and $78 million for the fair values ofrestricted stock-based awards and
 stock options assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we recorded approximately $6.7 billionof
 goodwill,  $3.2  billion  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  and  $763  million  of  net  liabilities.  Goodwill  generated  from  our  acquisition  of  NetSuite  was  primarilyattributable to synergies expected to arise after the 
acquisition and was not tax deductible.Other Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions
During
 fiscal  2017,  we  acquired  certain  companies  and  purchased  certain  technology  and  development  assets  primarily  to  expand  our  products  and  servicesofferings.
 These  acquisitions  were  not  individually  or  in  the  aggregate  significant.  We  have  included  the  financial  results  of  the  acquired  companies  in  ourconsolidated
 financial statements from their respective acquisition dates, and the results from each of these companies were not individually material to ourconsolidated
 financial statements. In the aggregate, the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $3.0 billion, which consisted of $3.0 billionin
 cash and $13 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. Based on their estimated fair values, we recorded $243million of net tangible assets and $948 milli
on of identifiable intangible assets and $1.8 billion of residual goodwill related to these fiscal 2017 acquisitions.Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES Cash
 and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities and other securities with original maturitiesof 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist 
of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities.The
 amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2019 and 2018. We use thespecific
 identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realizedgains
 and  losses  were  insignificant  for  fiscal  2019,  2018  and  2017.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  components  of  our  cash  equivalents  and  marketablesecurities held, substantially all of which were

 mature within one to four years. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limitpurchases
 of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any oneissuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse
 to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.restricted

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We
 perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer
 a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assetsand
 liabilities  required  to  be  recorded  at  their  fair  values,  we  consider  the  principal  or  most  advantageous  market  in  which  we  would  transact  and  considerassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or l
iabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.ASC
 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring
 fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fairvalue measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to me
asure fair value: 
•Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
•Level  2:  inputs  other  than  Level  1  that  are  observable,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  such  as  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  similar  assets  orliabilities,
 quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  becorroborated by observable market data for substantia
lly the full term of the assets or liabilities; or 
•Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a
 Recurring BasisOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value on
 a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputsare defined above):

 used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derivedfrom
 the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, orpricing
 models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including LIBOr-based yield curves, among others.

 $9,043   $8,966  
 
Deferred
 cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud orsupport
 contracts  that  are  typically  billed  in  advance  with  corresponding  revenues  generally  being  recognized  ratably  over  the  contractual  periods.  Deferredservices
 revenues  include  prepayments  for  our  services  business  and  revenues  for  these  services  are  generally  recognized  as  the  services  are  performed.Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typicall
y resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specifiedenhancements.
In
 connection  with  our  acquisitions,  we  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  the  cloud  services  and  license  support  performance  obligations  assumed  from  ouracquired
 companies.  We  generally  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  these  obligations  assumed  using  a  cost  build-up  approach.  The  cost  build-up  approachdetermines
 fair  value  by  estimating  the  costs  related  to  fulfilling  the  obligations  plus  a  normal  profit  margin.  The  sum  of  the  costs  and  operating  profitapproximates,
 in  theory, the  amount  that we would be  required  to pay  a third  party  to assume these  acquired  obligations. These  aforementioned  fair valueadjustments
 recorded  for  obligations  assumed  from  our  acquisitions  reduced  the  cloud  services  and  license  support  deferred  revenues  balances  that  werecorded
 as  liabilities  from  these  acquisitions  and  also  reduced  the  resulting  revenues  that  we  recognized  or  will  recognize  over  the  terms  of  the  acquiredobligations during the post-combination periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges 
— Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsIn
 May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July2025
 Notes  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro  denominated  2025  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  of  principal  atmaturity,
 to  variable-rate,  U.S.  Dollar denominated  debt  based  on  LIBOr.  In  July  2014,  we  entered  into  certain  interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  have  theeconomic effect of modifying the fixed
-interest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on thesesenior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOr. The crit
ical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes, October 2019Notes, and July 2021 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.
We
 have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC815.
 The  changes  in  fair  values  of  these  swap  agreements  are  recognized  as  interest  expense  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  with  thecorresponding
 amounts included in other current/non-current assets or other current/non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount ofnet
 gain  (loss)  attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  as  interest  expense  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  with  the  correspondingamount
 included in notes payable, current or notes payable, non-current. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2017-12, we have elected to exclude the portion ofthe

change
 in fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness.
 The change in fair value of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in AOCL. Theperiodic
 interest settlements for the swap agreements for the July 20 25 Notes, October  2019 Notes , and July  2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense andare included as a part of cash flows fr
om operating activities . Cash Flow Hedges 
— Cross-Currency Swap AgreementsIn
 connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currencyexchange
 risk  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated  January  2021  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  ofprincipal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. D
ollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flowsin
 U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of3.53%.
 We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuantto
 ASC  815.  The  critical  terms  of  the  cross-currency  swap  agreements  correspond  to  the  January  2021  Notes  including  the  annual  interest  payments  beinghedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.
We
 used the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swapagreements
 are recognized as other non-current assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the gains or losses on theeffective
 portion  of  these  cross-currency  swap  agreements  in  AOCL  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  an  amount  is  reclassified  out  of  AOCL  into  non-operating
 income, net in the same period that the carrying values of the Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense isrecognized.
 The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activitiesand the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are
 classified as financing activities.Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as 
HedgesWe
 transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated
 with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or
 decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolati
lity associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany
 sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Ourforeign
 currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generallydepend
 on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in thoserates, the net realized and unrealized gains or l
osses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.We
 do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of theend
 of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balancesheet
 classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other currentliabilities
 for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts isnon-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and l
osses.96

Unconditional Obligations
In
 the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable andlegally
 binding  and  specify  terms,  including:  fixed  or  minimum  quantities  to  be  purchased;  fixed,  minimum  or  variable  price  provisions; and  the  approximatetiming
 of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly andtesting of
 finished hardware products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projecteddemand information. Such
 purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillmentwithin agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard le
ad-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below. routinearrangements

Our
 cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe athird
 party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any materialliabilities
 related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customersagainst liabilities in
 the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under theseindemnification
 agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in eachparticular agreement.

Our
 Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreementduring the service period. 
Our license  and hardware agreements also generally include a  warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in theapplicable progra
m documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent within 
dustry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.We
 occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, amongothers,
 guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had amaterial effect on our results of operat
ions, financial position or cash flows.    In connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a
 court and entered into related indemnification agreements with eachof the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is prov

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of
 Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 17, 2018 and February 15, 2019, we announcedthat
 our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase  program collectively totaling $24.0  billion. As  of May 31,  2019, approximately  $5.8billion
 remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion (including 0.8million
 shares for $40 million that were repurchased but not settled), 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion, and 85.6 million shares for $3.5 billion in fiscal 2019,2018 and 2017, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.
Our
 stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capitalneeds, our
 cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economicand
 market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
During
 fiscal  2019,  2018  and  2017,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  cash  dividends  of  $0.81,  $0.76  and  $0.64  per  share  of  our  outstanding  common  stock,respectively, which we paid during the same period.
In
 June 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 31,2019
 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 17, 2019. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and paymentdates are subject to the final determination of our Bo
ard of Directors.100

 awards,  non-qualified  stock  options  and  incentive  stock  options,  as  well  as  stock  purchase  rights  and  stock  appreciation  rights,  to  our  eligibleemployees, officers and directors who are als
o employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. 
•In  fiscal  2011,  our  stockholders,  upon  the  recommendation  of  our  Board  of  Directors  (the  Board),  approved  the  adoption  of  the  Amended  andrestated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive
 Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased thenumber of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares.
 
•In  fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stockthat
 may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in theform
 of restricted stock units (rSUs) and performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs). For each share granted as a full value award under the2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares ava
ilable for grant. 
•In  fiscal 2018, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stockthat
 may  be  issued  under  the  2000  Plan  by  330,000,000  shares,  and  approved  material  terms  of  the  performance  goals  under  which  PSUs  andperformance-based stock options (PSOs) could be granted.
As
 of May 31, 2019, the 2000 Plan had 93 million unvested rSUs outstanding, 1 million unvested PSUs outstanding, 55 million PSOs outstanding and service-based
 stock  options  (SOs)  to  purchase  164  million  shares  of  common  stock  outstanding  of  which  143  million  shares  were  vested.  As  of  May  31,  2019,approximately
 301 million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rightsor stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.
The vesting
 schedule for all awards granted under the 2000 Plan is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally requireservice-ba
sed vesting of 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service overfour fiscal years. SOs are granted at
 not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10years
 from the date of grant. PSOs granted to three of our current executive officers in fiscal 2018 consist of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches thatpotentially
 may  vest.  One  tranche  vests  solely  on  the  attainment  of  a  market-based  metric.  The  remaining  six  tranches  require  the  attainment  of  both  aperformance metric and a market capitalizati
on metric. In each case, the market-based101

 and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs havecontractual lives o 
f eight years in comparison to  the typical ten year contractual lives for SOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and marketconditions, stoc
k-based compensation expense is to be recognized once each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service. We have prelimin
arily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement tobe 
up to five years. Stock-based compensation for t he  market-based tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metricachievement, which we have initially estimated t
o be approximately three years.In
 fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,including
 non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’
 Plan,  10  million  shares  of  common  stock  are  reserved  for  issuance (including  a  fiscal  2013  amendment  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  of  ourcommon stock reserved for issu
ance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, andexpire no
 more than 10 years from the date of grant. We currently grant rSUs only that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’Plan
 was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automaticgrants
 of stock awards to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for chairingcertain
 Board  committees,  subject  to  certain  stockholder  approved  limitations  set  forth  in  the  Directors’  Plan.  As  of  May  31,  2019,  approximately  90,000unvested
 rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’Plan. As of May 31, 2019, approximately 1 million shares
 were available for future stock awards under this plan.In
 connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective
 stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the 2000 Plan. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed orsubstituted
 generally  retain  all  of  the  rights,  terms  and  conditions  of  the  respective  plans  under  which  they  were  originally  granted.  As  of  May  31,  2019,approximately
 1  million  shares  of  restricted  stock-based  awards  and  stock  options  to  purchase  2  million  shares  of  common  stock  were  outstanding  underacquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.

 PSUs were granted in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018. In fiscal 2017, 1.7 million PSUs were granted which vest upon the attainment of certain performancemetrics and service-based vesting. Based upon
 actual attainment relative to the “target” performance metric, certain participants have the ability to be issued upto
 150% of the target number of PSUs originally granted, or to be issued no PSUs at all. In fiscal 2019, 2.4 million PSUs vested and 1.3 million PSUs remainedoutstanding as of May 31, 2019.

The  unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares expected to vest (unvested shares net of expected forfeitures) as of May 31, 2019 was approximately $254million and is expected to b

 estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market valuesas of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.
The
 fair values of our PSUs were also measured based upon their market values as of their respective grant dates, discounted for the present values of expecteddividends.
 The  vesting  conditions  and  related  terms  of  our  PSUs  were  communicated  to  each  participating  employee  as  of  their  respective  grant  dates  andincluded
 attainment metrics that were defined, fixed and based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined, fixed and consistentlydetermined, and
 that require the employee to render service. Therefore, these awards met the performance-based award classification criteria as defined withinASC 718.

We
 estimated the fair values of our stock options that were solely subject to service-based vesting requirements using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricingmodel,
 which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuati on  models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricingmodel,
 require the input of assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately howmuch
 we recognize as stock-based compensation  expense. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates foroptions
 assumed in a business combination. The weighted-average input assumptions used and resulting fair values of our service-ba sed stock options were asfollows for fiscal 201 
9 , 201 8 and 201 7 : 
 
 Year Ended May 31,   
 2019   2018   2017  Expected life (in years)

 1.7%   1.5%   1.5%  Weighted-average fair value per share
 $10.77   $9.34   $8.18  
 
The
 expected life input is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the risk-free interest rate input is based on U.S. Treasuryinstruments,
 the annualized dividend yield input is based on the per share dividend declared by the Board, and the volatility input is calculated based on theimplied volatility of
 our publicly traded options.We estimated the
 fair values of the PSOs granted during fiscal 2018 at approximately $10 per share using a Monte Carlo simulation approach as of the grant datewith the following assumptions: risk-free
 interest rate of 2.14%, expected term of seven years, expected volatility of 22.44% and dividend yield of 1.49%.Stock-based compensation expense is included in the following operating expense line

Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan We have
 an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fairmarket
 value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2019, 46 million shares were reserved for future issuances under thePurchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in fiscal
 2019 and 3 million shares in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, under the Purchase Plan.Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement
 PlansWe
 offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $380 million, $384 million and$366 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In
 the  U.S.,  regular  employees  can  participate  in  the  Oracle  Corporation  401(k)  Savings  and  Investment  Plan  (Oracle  401(k)  Plan).  Participants  can  generallycontribute
 up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit asdefined
 by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,subject
 to  maximum  aggregate  matching  amounts.  Our  contributions  to  the  Oracle  401(k)  Plan,  net  of  forfeitures,  were  $154  million,  $151  million  and  $157million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We
 also  offer  non-qualified  deferred  compensation  plans  to  certain  employees  whereby  they  may  defer  a  portion  of  their  annual  base  and/or  variablecompensation
 until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were eachapproxim
ately $566 million and approximately $555 million as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and othernon-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily
 by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through ouracquisitions
 or  are  required  by  local  regulatory  requirements.  We  may  deposit  funds  for  these  plans  with  insurance  companies,  third-party  trustees,  or  intogovernment-managed
 accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $90 million,$102
 million and $85 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) ofour
 defined  benefit  plans  as  of  May  31,  2019  were  $1.2  billion  and  $821  million,  respectively,  and  as  of  May  31,  2018  were  $1.1  billion  and  $711  million,respectively.

INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rates fo
r each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of incometax
 rates. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in Note 1 above under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of2017.”
 During  fiscal  2019,  we  recorded  a  net  benefit  of  $389  million  in  accordance  with  SAB  118  related  to  adjustments  in  our  estimates  of  the  one-timetransition
 tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings, and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities affected by the Tax Act. Our provisionfor
 income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, theU.S.
 research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Incomededuction, the tax effect of GILTI, and a reduction to our transition tax recorded consistent w
ith the provision of SAB 118. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax
 Act primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research anddevelopment
 tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Prior to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, our provision for income t
axes historically differed from the tax computed at106

We
 provide for taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We do not provide for taxes on other outside basis temporary differences of foreignsubsidiaries
 as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At May 31, 2019, the amount of temporary differences related to other outside basistemporary
 differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9 billion. If the otheroutside
 basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associatedwith
 the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2019, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferredtax liability ass
ociated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.5 billion.Our
 net deferred tax assets were $2.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the netdeferred
 tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxableincome
 in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and taxcredit carryforwards. The
 amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable incomechange.
The
 valuation allowance was $1.3 billion at each of May 31, 2019 and 2018. Substantially all of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2019 and 2018 related totax
 assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition ofthe
 associated  tax  benefits  associated  with  our  acquisitions  will  be  recorded  to  our  provision  for  income  taxes  subsequent  to  our  final  determination  of  thevaluation allowance or the conclusion 
of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.108

As
 of May 31, 2019,  2018 and 2017, $4.2 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate ifrecognized.
 We  recognized  interest  and  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  line  of  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations
 of $312 million, $127 million and $125 million during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2019 and2018 were $1.3 billion and $992 million, respectively.
Domestically,
 U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal2017.
 Many  issues  are  at  an  advanced  stage  in  the  examination  process,  the  most  significant  of  which  include  the  deductibility  of  certain  royalty  payments,transfer
 pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. With all ofthese
 domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2019, the gross unrecognized tax benefitsrelated
 to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $516 million ($357 millionnet
 of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and we are no longer subject to audit forthose
 periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject toaudit for those periods.
Internationally,
 tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it wasreasonably
 possible that, as of May 31, 2019, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by asmuch as $186 million ($87 million net of offsetting tax
 benefits) in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing.109

With some exceptions, we are generally no 
longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.We
 believe  that  we  have  adequately  provided  under  GAAP  for  outcomes  related  to  our  tax  audits.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurances  as  to  the  possibleoutcomes
 or any related financial statement effect thereof. On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing a previous decision of the U.S. TaxCourt, held that the
 U.S. Treasury Department’s regulations requiring the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense in a taxpayer’s cost-sharing calculationswere valid.
 Our financial statements have been prepared consistent with this outcome, but we will continue to monitor any ongoing developments, including thepossibility of rehearing or appeal t
o the U.S. Supreme Court, to determine if future changes are required.We
 are under audit by the IrS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved invarious
 challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, South korea, Mexico, Pakistan andSpain,
 where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision forincome
 taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes injudicial
 proceedings,  and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings  will not have a material effect on ourresults
 of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition ofbenefits in
 the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect taxliabilities are less than the ult
imate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.110

SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC
 280, Segment 
Reporting
,  establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of anenterprise
 about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, indeciding
 how  to  allocate  resources  and  in  assessing  performance.  Our  chief  operating  decision  makers  (CODMs)  are  our  Chief  Executive  Officers  and  ChiefTechnology
 Officer.  We  are  organized  by  line  of  business  and  geographically.  While  our  CODMs  evaluate  results  in  a  number  of  different  ways,  the  line  ofbusiness
 management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The footnote information belowpresents
 the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocatingcompany resources.
We
 have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. All three of our businessesmarket
 and  sell  our  offerings  globally  to  businesses  of  many  sizes,  government  agencies,  educational  institutions  and  resellers  with  a  worldwide  sales  forcepositioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
Our
 cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premisedeployment
 models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and licensesupport
 revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers overtime
 with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud servicesand
 license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become availableand
 for  which  the  customer  contracted  and  also  include  related  technical  support  services  over  the  contractual  term.  Cloud  license  and  on-premise  licenserevenues
 represent  fees  earned  from  granting  customers  licenses,  generally  on  a  perpetual  basis,  to  use  our  database  and  middleware  and  our  applicationssoftware
 products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to thecustomer
 to  download  and  use,  which  typically  is  immediately  upon  signature  of  the  license  contract.  In  each  fiscal  year,  our  cloud  and  license  business’contractual activi
ties are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscalquarter of the next fiscal year) as
 we receive payments from these contracts.Our
 hardware  business  provides  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware,  operating  systems,  virtualization,  management  andother
 hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also includes hardware support, which provides customers withsoftware updates for the software compone
nts that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software,and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Our
 services  business  provides  services  to  customers  and  partners  to  help  maximize  the  performance  of  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  andinfrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not
 practical to show assets by operating segment.111

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation
On
 June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of SantaClara
 against  Oracle  Corporation  alleging  numerous  causes  of  action  including  breach  of  contract,  breach  of  the  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing,defamation,
 intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint allegedthat
 when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, itbreached
 a  settlement  agreement  signed  on  September  20,  2010  between  HP  and  Mark  Hurd  (the  Hurd  Settlement  Agreement),  who  is  our  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer
 and  was  both  HP’s  former  chief  executive  officer  and  chairman  of  HP’s  board  of  directors.  HP  sought  a  judicial  declaration  of  the  parties’  rights  andobligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle
 answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.After
 a bench  trial on the  meaning  of the  Hurd  Settlement Agreement,  the  court found  that the Hurd  Settlement Agreement  required  Oracle to continue  todevelop certain of its software products for use on
 HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016,the
 jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracleon
 its  cross-claims.  The  jury  awarded  HP  $3.0  billion  in  damages.  Under  the  court’s  rulings,  HP  is  entitled  to  post-judgment  interest,  but  not  pre-judgmentinterest, on this award.
After the trial court
 denied Oracle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal ofthe trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest.
Oracle
 has posted a bond for the amounts owing. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations. We continue to believe that we havemeritorious defenses against HP’s claims, and
 we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court. Oracle filed its opening brief on March 7, 2019. Briefingon the appeal is scheduled to be completed by October 2019, and the appellate court has not scheduled a date for oral

argument. 
We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range  of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertaint y  surrounding the appealprocess
 and  the  nature  of  the  claims . Litigation  is  inherently  unpredictable,  and  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  process  related  to  this  action  is  uncertain.  It  ispossible that the resolution of this action could have
 a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations . Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracl
e’s NetSuite AcquisitionOn
 May  3,  2017,  a  stockholder  derivative  lawsuit  was  filed  in  the  Court  of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  and  on  July  18,  2017,  a  second  stockholderderivative
 lawsuit was filed in the same court. The second case was brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf. The suit wasbrought
 against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleges that thedefendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. at an excessive price. Plaintiff
 seeks declaratory relief, unspecifiedmonetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs.
On
 August 9, 2017, the court consolidated the two derivative cases. In a September 7, 2017 order, the court appointed plaintiff’s counsel in the second case aslead plaintiffs’ couns
el and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 27, 2017, andafter
 briefing and argument, the court denied this motion on March 19, 2018. The parties stipulated that all of the individual defendants, except for our ChiefTechnology Officer and one of our
 Chief Executive Officers, should be dismissed from this case without prejudice, and on March 28, 2018, the court approved thisstipulation. On May 4, 2018, the remaining defendants answered plaintiff’s complaint.
On
 May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three outsidedirectors
 serve on the SLC. On July 24, 2018, the court entered an order granting the SLC’s motion to stay this case for six months. The stay has been extendedtwice and is due to expire on August 15, 2019. 
The SLC and the two individual defendants are scheduled to participate in a mediat ion on July 2, 2019.While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, 
we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concernin
g Oracle’s Cloud BusinessOn
 August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Californiaagainst us,
 our Chief Technology Officer, our two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. On December 21, 2018,the
 court granted plaintiff’s motion that it be appointed lead plaintiff and approving its selection of lead plaintiff’s counsel. On March 8, 2019, plaintiff filed anamended
 complaint. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants made or are responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle’s cloud business. Plaintifffurther
 alleges  that  the  former  Oracle  executive  engaged  in  insider  trading.  Plaintiff  seeks  a  ruling  that  this  case  may  proceed  as  a  class  action,  and  seeksdamages, attorneys’ fees and
 costs, and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019, defendants moved to  dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint , and on May 31, 2019, plaintiff filed an opposition 
. We believe that we have meritori ous defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it.On
 February 12, 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought bytwo
 alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiffsclaim
 that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that Oracle’s Board members violatedtheir
 fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, reasonable inquiry, and good faith by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants’ actionsconstitute gross mismanagement, waste,

 securities fraud. Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciaryduties,
 an  order  directing  defendants  to  enact  corporat e  reforms,  attorneys’  fees  and  costs,  and  unspecified  equitable  relief. On  April  26,  2019,  the  courtapproved
 a stay of this action, which will be lifted if the class action discussed above is dismissed, if the motion to dismiss the class action is denied, or  if eitherparty voluntarily chooses to l
ift the stay.On
 May 8, 2019, a second derivative action was filed in the U.S. District  Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought by an allegedstockholder
 of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our two Chief Executive Officers, one former Oracle executive, andOracle as
 a nominal defendant. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, andplaintiff
 raises  further  allegations  of  impropriety  relating  to  Oracle’s  stock  buybacks  and  acquisition  of  NetSuite  Inc.  Plaintiff  asserts  claims  for  violation  ofsecurities
 laws, violation of fiduciary duties, contribution and indemnification. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that the case may proceed as a derivative action, and seeksdamages,
 declaratory  and  other  equitable  relief,  attorneys’  and  expert  fees  and  costs.  On  June  4,  2019,  the  court  issued  an  order  finding  that  this  case  wasrelated to the derivative case above and sta
ying the case under the court’s prior stay order.  While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims,

Certain Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and BylawsCertain provisions of the Delaware
 General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws summarized in the followingparagraphs may have an anti-takeover effect. In other w
ords, they could delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder mightconsider in its best interests, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market
 price for the shares held by such stockholder.Our Bylaws vest the power to ca
ll special meetings of stockholders in our chairman of the board of directors, any chief executive officer, our board ofdirectors or stockholders holding shares representing not less than 20% of the outstanding votes entitled to
 vote at the meeting. Stockholders are permittedunder our Certificate of Incorporation to act by written consent in 
lieu of a meeting.To be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, any stockholder proposa
l or nomination for the board of directors must bedelivered to our secretary by the close of business not m
ore than 120 and not less than 90 days prior to the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials forthe prior year’s annual meeting; provided that in the event that the date of
 the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from theanniversary of the previous year’s meeting, a stockholder’s written not
ice will be timely if it is delivered by the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meetingor the 10th day following the announcement of the date of the meeting. Such notice must contain informat
ion specified in the Bylaws as to the director nomineeor proposal of other business, information about the st
ockholder making the nomination or proposal and the beneficial owner, if any, on behalf of whom thenomination or proposal is made, including name and address, class and number of shares 
owned, and representations regarding the intention to make such aproposal or nomination and to so
licit proxies in support of it. With respect to director nominees, we may require any proposed nominee to furnish informationconcerning his or her eligibility to serve as 
an independent director or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder’s understanding of the independence ofthe nominee.
In addition, our Bylaws contain “proxy access” provis
ions, which give an eligible stockholder (or group of up to 20 such stockholders) continuouslyowning for at least three years 3%
 or more of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, the right to nominate up to thegreater of two nominees or 20% of the bo
ard of directors (rounded down to the nearest whole number) and have those nominees included in our proxystatement. To be timely, any proxy 
access notice must be delivered to our secretary by the close of business not more than 150 and not less than 120 days priorto the date on which we first mailed 
our proxy materials for the prior year’s annual meeting; provided that in the event that the date of the annual meeting isadvanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the anniversary
 of the previous year’s meeting, a proxy access notice will be timely if it is delivered by the laterof the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day follow
ing the announcement of the date of the meeting. The complete proxy access provisions fordirector nominations are set forth in our By
laws.Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law
We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL (“Section 203”). In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaw
are corporation from engaging invarious “business combination” transactions with any interested stockholder f
or a period of three years following the date of the transactions in which theperson became an interested stockholder, unless:
 
• the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior t o the date the interested stockholder obtained such status; 
• upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of
 the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced; or2

 • on or subsequent to such date the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at  an annual or special meetingof stockholders by the affirmative vote 
of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.A “business combination” is defined to include mergers, asset sales, and other transactions resulting in financia
l benefit to a stockholder. In general,an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affi
liates and associates, owns (or within three years, did own) 15% or more of a corporation’s votingstock. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other t
akeover or change in control attempts with respect to our company and, accordingly, may discourageattempts to acquire us even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity t
o sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price.DESCRIPTION OF 2.250% NOTES DUE 2021

On July 10, 2013, we issued €1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes and €750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025
Notes.  The Notes are listed and principally traded on the New
 York Stock Exchange under the symbol “OrCL.” As of May 31, 2019, €1,250,000,000 aggregateprincipal amount of 2021 Notes were outstanding and €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes were outstanding.
Interest and Maturity
The 2021 Notes will mature on January 10, 2021 and the 2025 Notes will mature on July 10, 2025. The Notes were issued in book-entry form 
only, inminimum denominations of €100,000 and multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Interest on the Notes accrued beginning on July 10, 2013. The 2021 Notes bear
interest at the rate of 2.250% per year and the 2025 Notes bear interest at the rate
 of 3.125% per year. The interest on the 2021 Notes is payable annually onJanuary 10, commencing on January 10, 2014, to the persons in whose names the 2021 Notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding December
26.  The interest on the 2025 Notes is payable annually on July 10, commencing on July 10, 2014, to the persons in whose names the 2025 Notes are registered at
the close of business on the preceding June 25. Interest on the Notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for
 which interest isbeing calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest w
as paid on the Notes, to but excluding the next scheduledinterest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook 
of the International Capital MarketAssociation. If any interest payment date, maturity date 
or redemption date falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment will be made on the nextbusiness day with the same force and effect as if made 
on the relevant interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date. Unless we default on apayment, no interest will accrue for that period from
 and after the applicable interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date.The term “business day” means any day, other than a Saturday 
or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in the City of New Yorkor London are authorized or required by law
 or executive order to3

close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TArGET2 system), or any successor thereto, isopen.
Issuance in Euro
All payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, are pa
yable in euro. If the euro is unavailable tous due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control
 or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of theEuropean Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for
 the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the internationalbanking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be m
ade in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. The amount payableon any date in euro would be converted into U.S. dol
lars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro. Any payment in respect of theNotes so made in U.S. dollars w
ould not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall have anyresponsibility for any calculation 
or conversion in connection with the forgoing.Issuance of Additional Notes
The Notes were initially l
imited in aggregate principal amount to €1,250,000,000 for the 2021 Notes and €750,000,000 for the 2025 Notes. We may,without the consent of the holders, increase the principal amount of any series
 of Notes by issuing additional Notes of such series in the future on the sameterms and conditions, except for any differences in the issue price, interest accrued prior to the issue date of
 the additional Notes and, in some cases, the firstinterest payment date. The additional Notes of a
 series would have the same ISIN and CUSIP number as the applicable series of Notes. Under the Indenture, eachseries of Notes and any additional Notes
 of such series we may issue would be treated as a single series for all purposes under the Indenture, including forpurposes of determining whether the required percentage of the holders of record has given approval or consent to an amendment or 
waiver or joined indirecting the trustee to take certain actions on behalf of a
ll holders.We also may, without the consent of the holders, issue 
other series of debt securities under the Base Indenture in the future on terms and conditionsdifferent from the Notes.
The Indenture
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee for
 any and all securities issued under the Indenture, including the Notes, and isreferred to herein as the “trustee.” The paying agent for the Notes is The Bank 
of New York Mellon, London Branch.In accordance with the Indenture, Oracle Systems Corporation is no longer an obligor
 under the Indenture and is not an obligor on the Notes. Oracleis the sole obligor on the Notes.
The Notes are the unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Oracle and are ranked 
pari
passu
 with Oracle’s other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (
including trade payables andpreferred stock obligations) of Oracle’s subsidiaries 
and are effectively subordinated to Oracle’s existing and future secured indebtedness, if any, and that ofOracle’s subsidiaries, if any. The Notes are effectivel
y subordinated to all such liabilities of Oracle’s subsidiaries and the rights of creditors of such subsidiarieshave priority over the rights of the holders of
 the Notes as creditors of Oracle. The Indenture does not limit the ability of Oracle to incur additional unsecuredindebtedness. There are no restrictions in the Indenture governing the Notes that restrict Oracle’s subsidiaries from granting security interests or l
iens on any orall of their assets.
Optional Redemption
The Notes of each series are redeemable, in whole 
or in part at any time, at our option, each at a “make-whole premium” redemption pricecalculated by us equal to the greater of:
4

(1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and(2) 
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion ofsuch payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on 
an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at theapplicable Comparable Government Bond rate (as defined below
), plus 20 basis points with respect to the 2021 Notes and 25 basis points with respect to the2025 Notes,
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that
 are dueand payable on interest payment dates falling on 
or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders as of theclose of business on the relevant record date according to the Notes and the Indenture.
“ 
Comparable Government Bond Rate ” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes to be redeemed, if they 
were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to thedate fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption y
ield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on thebasis of the middle market price of the Comparable
 Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by anindependent investment bank selected by us.
“ 
Comparable Government Bond ” means, in relation to any Compar able Government Bond rate calculation, at the discretion of an independentinvestment bank selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest t
o the maturity of the Notes to be redeemed, or if such independentinvestment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in 
issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bankmay, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market m
akers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining theComparable Government Bond rate.
Notice of any redemption will be ma
iled at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to beredeemed. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest w
ill cease to accrue on the Notes or portionsthereof called for redemption. If less than all 
of the Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the trustee by suchmethod the trustee deems to be fair and appropriate in accordance with applicable deposit
ary procedures.The Notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturit
y if certain events occur involving U.S. taxation. If any of these special tax events do occur,the Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of
 their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. See thesection titled “redemption for Tax reasons” below.

No Sinking FundThe Notes are not entitled to the benefit of any s
inking fund.Events of Default
An “Event of Default” with respect to a series 
of Notes includes the occurrence of one or more of the following events:(1) 
default in paying interest on Notes of such series when it becomes due and the default continues for a period of 30 days or more;(2) 
default in paying principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes of such series when due;(3) 
default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant in the Indenture (other than defaults specified in clause (1) or (2) above) inrespect of such series and the default or breach continues for a period of 90 days or
 more after there has been given to us a written notice from the trustee orthere has been given to us and the trustee a written notice from the holders of
 at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of allseries affected thereby;
(4) 
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, administration or similar proceedings with respect to us or any materialsubsidiary has occurred; and
(5) 
any other Events of Default set forth in the Indenture.If an Event of Default (other than an Event of
 Default specified in clause (4) with respect to us) under the Indenture occurs with respect to a series ofNotes and is continuing, then the trustee may and, at the direction of the holders of at 
least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series, willby written notice, require us to repay immediately
 the entire principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series, together with all accrued and unpaidinterest and premium, if any.
If an Event of Default under the Indenture specified in clause (4) with respect to us occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the
outstanding Notes will automatically
 become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder.After a declaration of acceleration or
 any automatic acceleration under clause (4) described above with respect to a series of Notes, the holders of amajority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series m
ay rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing Events of Default, except fornonpayment of the principal and interest on the Notes of such series that has become due sole
ly as a result of the accelerated payment requirement, have beencured or waived and if the rescission of accelerati
on would not conflict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a majority in principal amount of theoutstanding Notes of such series also have the right to wa
ive past defaults with respect to such series, except a default in paying principal or interest on anyoutstanding Note, or in respect of a covenant or a provisi
on that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of all holders of the Notes of such series.Holders of at least 25% in principal
 amount of the outstanding Notes of a series may seek to institute a proceeding only after they have made writtenrequest, and offered such indemnity as the trustee may reasonably require, to the trustee to institute 
a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60days after it received this notice. In addition, within this 60-day
 period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request byholders of a majority in principal 
amount of the outstanding Notes of such series. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a holder of aNote for the enforcement of the payment of principal, interest or any
 premium on or after the due dates for such payment.During the existence of an Event of Default of which a
 responsible officer of the trustee has actual knowledge or has received written notice from usor any holder of the Notes, the trustee is required to exercise
13

the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would under thecircumstances in the conduct of that person’s own affairs. If an Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing, the trustee is not under any obligation to exerciseany of its rights or powers at
 the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have offered to the trustee such security or indemnity as thetrustee may reasonably require. Subject to certain provisions, the holders of
 a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected (voting as a single class) have the r
ight to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, orexercising any trust, or power conferred on the trustee.
The trustee will, within 45 days after any default
 occurs with respect to a series, give notice of the default to the holders of the Notes of such series,unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless
 there is a default in paying principal, interest or any premium when due, the trustee can withhold givingnotice to the holders if it determines in good fa
ith that the withholding of notice is in the interest of the holders.We are required to furnish to the trustee an annual statement as to
 compliance with all conditions and covenants under the Indenture.Satisfaction, Discharge and Covenant Defeasance
We may terminate our obligations under the Indenture, when:
 
• either:  
o all the debt securities issued under the Base Indenture that have been authenticated and delivered have been accepted by the trustee for cancellation; or
 
o all the debt securities issued under the Base Indenture that have not been accepted by the trustee for cancellation will become due and payable within one year (a
 “discharge”) and we have made irrevocable arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of noticeof redemption by such trustee in our name, and at our expense and we have irrevocabl
y deposited or caused to be deposited with thetrustee sufficient funds to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such notes to pay principal, interest and any premium;
 
• we have paid or caused to be paid all  other sums then due and payable under the Indenture; and 
• we have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent under theIndenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with.
We may elect to have our obligat
ions under the Indenture discharged with respect to a series of Notes (“legal defeasance”). Legal defeasance meansthat we will be deemed to have paid 
and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes of such series, except for: 
• the rights of holders of the Notes of such series to receive principal, interest and any premium when due; 
• our obligations with respect to the Notes of such series concerning issuing temporary notes, registr ation of transfer of the Notes, mutilated,destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an 
office or agency for payment for Notes payments held in trust; 
• the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and  
• the defeasance provisions of the Indenture. 14

In addition, we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certain covenants in the Indenture (“covenant defeasance”). Any failure tocomply with these obligations wil
l not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes. In the event covenant defeasance occurs, certainevents, not including non-payment, bankruptcy and insolvency events, described under “Events of Default” will no longer constitute an event of default for that
series.
In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance w
ith respect to outstanding Notes of a series: 
• we must irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited w ith the trustee as trust funds for the purpose of making the followingpayments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to
 the benefits of the holders of the Notes of such series: 
o money in an amount;  
o U.S. Government Obligations; or  
o a combination of money and U.S. Government Obl igations, 
• in each case sufficient without reinvestment, in the written opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants topay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the trustee to pay and discharge, all 
of the principal, interest and any premium at due date ormaturity or if we have made 
irrevocable arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the trustee in ourname and at our expense, the redemption date;
 
• in the case of legal defeasance, we must have delivered to  the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that, as a result of an IrS ruling or a changein applicable federal income tax la
w, the holders of the Notes of such series will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as aresult of the deposit, defeasance and discharge to be effected and will be subject to the same federal 
income tax as would be the case if thedeposit, defeasance and discharge did not occur;
 
• in the case of covenant defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opini on of counsel to the effect that the holders of the Notes ofsuch series will not recognize gain or l
oss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and covenant defeasance to beeffected and will be subject to the same federal income tax 
as would be the case if the deposit and covenant defeasance did not occur; 
• no default with respect to the outstanding Notes of such series has occurred and is continuing at the time of  such deposit after giving effect tothe deposit or, in the case of legal defeasance, no default rel
ating to bankruptcy or insolvency has occurred and is continuing at any time on orbefore the 91st day after the date of such deposit, it being understood that this condition is not deemed sat
isfied until after the 91st day; 
• the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not cause the trustee t o have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust IndentureAct, assuming all Notes of such series were in default within the me
aning of such Act 
• the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result  in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement orinstrument to which we are a party;
 
• the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result  in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company withinthe meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless the trust is registered under such Act or exempt from registration;
and
15

 • we have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent with respect to thedefeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with.
Unclaimed Funds
All funds deposited with the trustee or any paying agent for the payment of
 principal, interest, premium or additional amounts in respect of theNotes that remain unclaimed for two years
 after the maturity date of such Notes will be repaid to us upon our request. Thereafter, any right of any noteholder tosuch funds shall be enforceable only against us, and the trustee and paying agents will have no
 liability therefor.Notices
Notices to holders of the Notes are made by f
irst class mail, postage prepaid, to the addresses that appear on the security register of the Notes.Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Note
We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream B
anking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V.,or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear
 System (“Euroclear”) and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. Wetake no responsibility for an accurate portra
yal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understandingof the rules and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as
 they are currently in effect. Those clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at anytime.
The Notes of each series are represented by one or more ful
ly registered global notes. Each such global note is deposited with, or on behalf of, acommon depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common deposit
ary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear. Except as set forthbelow, the global notes may be transferred, in whole
 and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. The holder of the Notes mayhold their interests in the global notes in Europe through Clearstream
 or Euroclear, either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizationswhich are participants in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear ho
ld interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations orcustomers through customers’ securities accounts in Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s names on the books of their
 respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in theNotes and all transfers relating to the Notes 
are reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear.The distribution of the Notes is cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear.
 Any secondary market trading of book-entry interests in the Notes takesplace through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and settles in same
-day funds. Owners of book-entry interests in the Notes receive payments relating totheir Notes in euro, except as otherwise described under “Issuance in Euro.”
Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities 
and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial links among themselvesand others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links all
ow the Notes to be issued, held and transferred among the clearing systemswithout the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to f
acilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing systems totrade securities across borders in the secondary market.
The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear
 govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the investor’s interest in the Notesheld by them. We have no responsibility for any
 aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants. We also donot supervise these systems in any way.
Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clear
ance and settlement functions under agreements they have made with oneanother or with their customers. They are not obl
igated to perform or continue to perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at anytime.
16

Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in the Notes are not entitled to have the Notes registered in their names, will not receiveand are not 
entitled to receive physical delivery of the Notes  in definitive form and are not considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the Indenture,including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to the Indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a
Note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if such person is not a
 participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person ownsits interest, in order to exercise any rights of
 a holder of the Notes.We have been advised by Clearstream and Euroclear, respectively, as
 follows:Clearstream
Clearstream advises that it is 
incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for itsparticipating organizations (“Clearstream P
articipants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participantsthrough electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physica
l movement of certificates. Clearstreamprovides to Clearstream Participants, among other things, services for s
afekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securitiesand securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets
 in several countries. Clearstream is registered as a bank in Luxembourg and,as such, is subject to regulation by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier and the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg, which supervises and overseas
the activities of Luxembourg banks. Clearstream Participants 
are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers anddealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations 
and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is alsoavailable to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that cle
ar through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant,either directly or indirectly.
Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially
 through Clearstream are credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants inaccordance with its rules and procedures.
Euroclear
Euroclear advises that it was created 
in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to clear and settletransactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry del
ivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physicalmovement of certificates and any risk from 
lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear includes various other services, including securitieslending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. 
Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”),under contract with Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C., a Belgian co
operative corporation (the “Cooperative”). All operations are conducted by the EuroclearOperator, and all Euroclear securities clear
ance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator, not the Cooperative. TheCooperative establishes policy for 
Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokersand dealers, and other professional financial intermediaries
 and may include any agents. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clearthrough or maintain a custodial relationship w
ith a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms 
and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear,the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, and applicable Belgi
an law (collectively, the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditionsgovern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawa
ls of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear,and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. Al
l securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificatesto specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions 
only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no recordof or relationship with persons holding interests in the Notes
 through Euroclear Participants.17

Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear are credited to the cash accounts of Eurocle ar Participants inaccordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Clearance and 
Settlement ProceduresWe understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants occurs in the ordinar
y way following theapplicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary
 market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventionaleurobonds in registered form.
Investors in the Notes are only be able to m
ake and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the Notes through Clearstreamand Euroclear on days when those systems are 
open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and otherinstitutions are open for business in the United States.
In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions 
involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the samebusiness day as in the United States. U.S. investors who 
wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the Notes, ona particular day, may find that the transactions 
will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstreamor Euroclear is used.
Clearstream or Euroclear wi
ll credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in accordancewith the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary.
 Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, will take anyother action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on behalf of a Cle
arstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with itsrelevant rules and procedures.
Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the forego
ing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among participants of Clearstreamand Euroclear. However, they are under no obligati
on to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at anytime.
Certificated Notes
If the depositary for any of the Notes represented by a registered gl
obal note is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or ceases tobe a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor depositary registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act is not appointed by us
within 90 days, we will issue Notes 
in definitive form in exchange for the registered global note that had been held by the depositary. Any Notes issued indefinitive form in exchange for a registered global note
 will be registered in the name or names that the depositary gives to the trustee or other relevant agent ofthe trustee. It is expected that the depositary’s instructions will be based upon directions received by the depositar
y from participants with respect to ownershipof beneficial interests in the registered global note that had been held by the deposit
ary. In addition, we may at any time determine that the Notes of eitherseries shall no longer be represented by a global note
 and will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for such global note pursuant to the procedure describedabove.
Concerning Our Relationship with the Trustee
We maintain ordinary banking relationships and credit facil
ities with The Bank of New York Mellon, an affiliate of the trustee for the Notes.18
