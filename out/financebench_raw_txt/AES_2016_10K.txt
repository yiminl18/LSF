ITEM 1. BUSINESSItem 1. 
Business is an outline of our strategy and our businesses by SBU, inc luding key financial drivers. Additional items that may have animpact on our businesses are discussed in Item 1A.— 
Risk Factors and Item 3.— Legal Proceedings . Executive Summary
Incorporated in 1981, AES is a diversified po
wer generation and utility company, providing affordable, sustainable energy through our diverseportfolio of thermal and renewable generati
on facilities as well as distribution businesses. Our vision is to be the world's leading sustainable powercompany by leveraging our uniqu
e electricity platforms and the knowledge of our people to provide the energy and infrastructure solutions ourcustomers truly need. Our people share a passion to help meet the world's current an
d increasing energy needs, while providing communities andcountries the opportunity for economic growth due to the availa
bility of reliable, affordable electric power.
Future growth across our company will be heavily we
ighted towards less carbon-intensive wind, solar and gas generation. Growth inrenewables not only provides an o
pportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generation, but also presents significant potential for energystorage. We are a leader in lithium ion, battery-based energy storage, with more than 40
0 MW in operation, under construction or in advanceddevelopment across seven countries. We believe l
ithium ion-based energy storage will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-basedgeneration mix. With our technological experi
ence, presence in key markets and channel sales partnerships, we are positioned to capitalize on thisrapidly growing market.
Additionally, we have bee
n expanding our LNG infrastructure in Central America, where we are helping to displace oil-fired generation in favorof a cheaper and cleaner alternative. In the United States, at IPL, we recently complete
d a multi-year rate-base investment in environmentalupgrades to our coal plants and are in the process of re-poweri
ng several units from coal to gas.6

SegmentsWe are organized into six market-oriented strategic business units ("SBUs"): 
US (United States), Andes (Chile, Colombia, and  Argentina),Brazil 
, MCAC (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean), Europe , and Asia — which are led by our SBU Presidents. Within our six SBUs, we have two lines of business. The first business line is g
eneration, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power tocustomers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. The secon
d business line is utilities, where we own and/or operate utilities togenerate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residenti
al, commercial, industrial and governmentalsectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also g
enerate and sell electricity on the wholesale market.The Company measures the operating performance of its SBUs usin
g Adjusted PTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow, both of which are non-GAAP measures. The Adjusted PTC and Proportion
al Free Cash Flow by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2016 are shown below. The percentages for Adjusted PTC and Proportion
al Free Cash Flow are the contribution by each SBU to the gross metric, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC bySBU, before deductions for Corporate. See Item 7.— 
Management's Discussion and An alysis SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for reconciliation and definiti

OverviewGeneration
We currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 
30,379 MW, excluding the generation capabil ities of our integrated utilities. Ourgeneration fleet is diversified by fuel type. See disc
ussion below under Fuel Costs . Performance drivers of our generation businesses incl
ude types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, fuel costs,seasonality, weather variations and eco
nomic activity, fixed-cost management, and competition.Electricity Sales Contracts 
— Our generation businesses sell electricity und er medium- or long-term contracts ("contract sales") or under short-term agreements in competitive markets ("short-term sales").
Contract Sales 
— Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts. Our medium-term contract sales have a term of 2 to 5 years, while our long-term contracts have a term of more than 5 years. Across our portfolio, the average remaining contract term is 6 years.
In contract sales, our generation businesses recover variabl
e costs including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or tolling arrang
ements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs orenter into fuel supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussio
n under the Fuel Costs section below). These contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel prices and electricity prices by l
inking the business's revenues and costs. These contracts also help us tofund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through lon
g-term non-recourse project-level financing.Capacity Payments and Contract Sales 
— Most of our contract sales include a capacity payment that covers projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses and a return on ca
pital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity paymentbe denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs. We general
ly structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk bymatching the currency of revenue and expenses, inclu
ding fixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt forwhich we typically hedge a sig
nificant portion of our exposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacitypayment, which is discussed in more detail in the 
Capacity Payments and Short-Term Sales section below. Thus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to chan
ges in power and fuel prices,currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these co
ntracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses anda return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliabil
ity and efficiency standards required in the contract.Short-Term Sales 
— Our other generation businesses sell power an d ancillary services under short-term contracts with an average term ofless than 2 years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market, or, in some cases, at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically
administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, wh
ere the least expensivegeneration facilities, based upo
n variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-termprice is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash
flows and earnings associated with thes
e businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of thesewholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to supp
ort the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, weprovide a wide array of ancillary services, includ
ing voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves.In certain markets, such as Argentina and Kazakhstan, a regulator establis
hes the prices for electricity and fuel and adjusts them periodicallyfor inflation, changes in fuel prices and other factors. In these cases, our businesses are p
articularly sensitive to changes in regulation.Capacity Payments 
— Many of the markets in which we operate include regulated ca pacity markets. These capacity markets are intended toprovide additional revenu
e based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets aretypically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relativ
e to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available inexcess of peak demand). Our generating facilities selli
ng in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability inthe market. Our most significant capacity revenues are earned by our generation capac
ity in Ohio and Northern Ireland.12

Plant Reliability and Flexibility — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally mana ge availability,operating efficiency and flexibil
ity. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales,our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture p
eak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us tocapture ancillary service revenue whil
e meeting local market needs.Fuel Costs 
— For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant compone nt of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we oftenenter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts have period
ic adjustments forchanges in fuel cost indices. In those cases, we have fuel su
pply agreements with shorter terms to match those adjustments. For certain projects,we have tolling arrangements where the po
wer offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.In short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel
supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with o
ur market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant forpower prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding
commodity price risk please see Item 7A.— 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures ab out Market Risk in this Form 10-K. 34% 
of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants, and at our plant in Haw
aii, we source coal internationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize thepurchasing power of our fuel procurement.
33% 
of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by natural g as. Generally, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. A fewexceptions to this are AES Gener in Chile, where we p
urchase imported gas from third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic, where weimport LNG to utilize in the local market.
27% 
of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by renew ables, including hydro, wind and energy storage, which do not have significantfuel costs.
6% 
of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes oil, diesel and petroleum coke ("pet coke") for fuel. Oil and diesel are sourced locally at priceslinked to international markets, while pet coke is larg
ely sourced from Mexico and the U.S.Renewable Generation Facili
ties — We currently own and operate 8,228 MW (4,293 proportional MW) of renewable generation, includ inghydro, wind, energy storage, solar, biomass and landfil
l gas.Seasonality, Weather Variations and Eco
nomic Activity — Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal w eather patterns throughoutthe year and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly by month d
uring the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature,solar and wind resources, and hydrolog
ical conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. Incompetitive markets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on p
ower demand and short-term prices for power.Fixed-Cost Management 
— In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the capacitypayment. However, for all generation businesses, mana
ging fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.Competition 
— For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For short- term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and l
ocal dispatch and reliability rules.Utilities
AES' seven utility businesses distrib
ute power to 9.4 million people in three countries. AES' two utiliti es in the U.S. also include generationcapacity totaling 
6,314  MW. The utility businesses have a variety of structures, ranging from integrated utility to pure transmission and distribution businesses.
In general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes an
d businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performancedrivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variati
ons, economic activity, reliability of service andcompetition. Revenue from utilities is classified as regu
lated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Regulated Rate of Return and Tariff 
— In exchange for the exclusive right to sell or distribute electricity in a franchise area, our util itybusinesses are subject to government regulatio
n. This regulation sets the prices ("tariffs") that our utilities are allowed to charge retail customers forelectricity and establishes service standards that we are requ
ired to meet.13

Our utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowedregulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on whic
h the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulatorand is based on the amount of assets that are considered used a
nd useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base areimportant components of the utility's earning power. The all
owed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator arerecovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.
The tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regu
lations, or the utility may seek a change in itstariffs. The tariff is generally based upon a certain usage level a
nd may include a pass-through to the customer of costs that are not controlled by theutility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy. In additio
n to fuel and purchased energy,other types of costs may be passed through to customers via an existing mechanism, such as certain environme
ntal expenditures that are coveredunder an environmental tracker at our utility in Indiana, IPL. Compon
ents of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usuallyadjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-base
d mechanism. In some regulatory regimes, customers with demandabove an established leve
l are unregulated and can choose to contract with other retail energy suppliers directly and pay wheeling and other non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution compa
ny for use of its distribution system.The regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility bus
inesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manageuncollectible amounts, quality of service an
d non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risknon-recovery of costs or diminished returns.
Seasonality, Weather Variations and Eco
nomic Activity — Our utility businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns through out the yearand, therefore, the operating revenues and associate
d operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. Additionally, weathervariations may also have an impact based on the numb
er of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions and customers' historicusage levels and patterns. The retail kWh sales, after adjustments for weather variations, are affected by cha
nges in local economic activity, energyefficiency and distributed generation i
nitiatives, as well as the number of retail customers.Reliability of Service 
— Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration an d frequency of outages. Thosestandards may be specific with incentives or penalti
es for performance against these standards. In other cases, the standards are implicit and theutility must operate to meet customer expectations.
Competition 
— Our integrated utilities, IPL and DP&L, operate as the sole distributor of electricity with in their respective jurisdictions. Ourbusinesses own and operate al
l of the businesses and facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Competition in theregulated electric business is primarily from the on-site generatio
n for industrial customers; however, in Ohio, customers in our service territory havethe ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their generation servic
e. Our integrated utilities, particularly DP&L, are exposed to the volatility inwholesale prices to the extent our generating ca
pacity exceeds the native load served under the regulated tariff and short-term contracts. See thefull discussion under the US SBU.
At our pure transmission and distribution business
es, such as those in Brazil and El Salvador, we face relatively limited competition due tosignificant barriers to entry. At many of these businesses, large customers, as defined by the relevant regul
ator, have the option to both leave andreturn to regulated service.
Development and Construction
We develop and construct new generation faci
lities. For our utility businesses, new plants may be built in response to customer needs or tocomply with regulatory developments and are dev
eloped subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on ourinvestment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is pl
atform expansion opportunities, where we can add on to our existingfacilities in our key platform markets where we have a competitive advantag
e. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating theproject returns and financial profile agai
nst a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporatedebt repayment and share buybacks.
In some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity
contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek no
n-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners where itis commercially attractive. For construction, we typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our constructio
n managementteam supervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project's bud
get and the required safety, efficiency and productivitystandards.

U.S. Utilities
IPALCO
Business Description 
— IPALCO owns all of the outstanding common stock of IPL. IPL is engaged primarily i n generating, transmitting,distributing and selling el
ectric energy to approximately 490,000 retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state ofIndiana. IPL has an exclusive right to provide el
ectric service to those customers. IPL's service area covers about 528 square miles with anestimated population of approximately 93
9,000. IPL owns and operates four generating stations. IPL’s largest generating station, Petersburg, iscoal-fired. The second largest station, Harding Street, has converted its coal-fired u
nits to natural gas and uses natural gas and fuel oil to powercombustion turbines. The third, Eagle Valley, retired its coal-fired u
nits in April 2016 and their CCGT is expected to be completed in the first half of2018. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a small peaking station that uses natura
l gas to power combustion turbines. As of December 31, 2016,IPL's net electric generation capacity for winter is 2,993 MW and net summer capacity is 2,878 MW.
Market Structure 
— IPL is one of many transmission system owner members in the MISO. MISO is a RTO, which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and a
ncillary services markets in the U.S. IPLoffers the available electricity production of each of its generati
on assets into the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. MISO operates on a meritorder dispatch, considering transmission constraints an
d other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region.Regulatory Framework - 
Retail Ratemaking — In addition to the regulations referred to below in Other Regulatory Matters , IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to IPL's services and faciliti
es; retail rates and charges; the issuance of long-term securities; and certain othermatters. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL's business is both comprehensive a
nd typical of the traditional form of regulation generallyimposed by state public utility commissions. IPL's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges,
16

which are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings. The IURC gives consideration to all allowable costs for ratemaking purposesincluding a fair return on the fair value of the utility property used and us
eful in providing service to customers. In addition, IPL's rates include variousadjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel a
nd purchased power costs to meet IPL's retail loadrequirements, referred to as the FAC, and (ii) a rider for the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulatio
nsreferred to as the Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery Ad
justment. These components function somewhat independently of one another, butthe overall structure of IPL's rates and charges would be subject to review at the time of any review of IPL's b
asic rates and charges.In March 2016, the IURC issued an order authorizing IPL to increase its bas
ic rates and charges by approximately $31 million annually. OnDecember 22, 2016, IPL filed a petition with the IURC for authority to increase its bas
ic rates and charges, primarily to recover the cost of the newEagle Valley CCGT. The Eagle V
alley CCGT was previously expected to be completed in the first half of 2017, but is now expected to be completedin the first half of 2018. To address this change, on February 24, 2017, IPL filed a motion to with
draw the case without prejudice or alternativelyamend the petition at a later date. No assurances can be give
n as to the timing or outcome of this proceeding.Environmental Regulation 
— For information on compliance with environmental reg ulations see Item 1. —United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regula
tions . Replacement Generation 
— IPL has several generating units that have been rece ntly retired or refueled. These units were primarily coal-firedand represented 472 MW of net capacity in total. To replace this generatio
n, IPL has approval to build a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at its Eagle ValleyStation site in Indiana and refuel its Hardin
g Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (approximately 100 MW net capacity each) with atotal budget of $649 million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $632 mil
lion. IPL was granted authority to accrue post in-serviceallowance for debt and equity funds use
d during construction, and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refuelingproject. These costs to build and operate the CCGT and the refueli
ng project, other than fuel costs, will not be recoverable by IPL through rates untilthe conclusion of a base rate case proceedin
g with the IURC after the assets have been placed in service. The CCGT is expected to be completedin the first half of 2018, and the refueling project was completed in D
ecember 2015.In July 2015 IPL received approval from the IURC for a CPN to refuel the Harding Street Statio
n Unit 7 from coal to natural gas (about 410 MWnet capacity). The Harding Street Station Unit 7 conversion was comp
leted in the second quarter of 2016.Key Financial Drivers 
— IPL's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, energy efficiency and wholesale prices. Inaddition, IPL's financial results are like
ly to be driven by many factors including but not limited to:•
rate case outcomes•
the timely recovery of capital expenditures through base rate growth•
the passage of new legislation or implementation of regulationsConstruction and Development 
— IPL's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations andcompliance with environmental la
ws and regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overallperformance. Refer to the section above for a description of our major construction projects.
DPL
Business Description 
— DPL is an energy holding company w hose principal subsidiaries include DP&L and AES Ohio Generation, LLC.DP&L generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to approximately 5
19,000 customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West CentralOhio. DP&L, solely or through jointly owne
d facilities, owns 2,510 MW of generation capacity and numerous transmission facilities.AES Ohio Generation, LLC owns peaki
ng generation units representing 556 MW located in Ohio and Indiana.On January 1, 2016, DPL closed on the sale of DPLE
R to Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. DPLER, a competitive retail marketer, sold retailelectricity to more than 124,000 retail customers in Ohio and Illinois w
hile owned by DPL. Approximately 110,000 of those customers were alsodistribution customers of DP&L in Ohio.
Market Structure 
— Since January 2001, electric customers within Ohio have b een permitted to choose to purchase power under a contractwith a CRES Provider or to continue to purchase pow
er from their local utility17

under SSO rates established by the tariff. DP&L and other Ohio utilities continue to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in their statecertified territories, and DP&L has the obligation to provi
de retail generation service to customers that did not choose an alternative supplier.Beginning in 2014, a portio
n of the SSO generation supply was no longer supplied by DP&L, but was provided by third parties through a competitivebid process. A total of 10%, 60% and 100% of the SSO load was sourced throug
h competitive bid in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The PUCOmaintains jurisdiction over DP&L's d
elivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services. The PUCO has issued extensive rules on how andwhen a customer can switch generation suppl
iers, how the local utility will interact with CRES Providers and customers, including for billing andcollection purposes, and which e
lements of a utility's rates are "bypassable" (i.e., avoided by a customer that elects a CRES Provider) and whichelements are "non-bypassable" (i.e., charged to all customers receiving a d
istribution service irrespective of what entity provides the retail generationservice).
DP&L is a member of PJM. The PJM RTO operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in a
ll or parts of Pennsylvania, NewJersey, Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Virginia, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Caroli
na, Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. PJM has an integratedplanning process to identify potentia
l needs for additional transmission to be built to avoid future reliability problems. PJM also runs the day-aheadand real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members.
As a member of PJM, DP&L is also subject to charges and costs associated with PJM operatio
ns as approved by the FERC. Prior to 2015, theRPM was PJM's capacity construct. In 2015, PJM implemented a new CP program, replacing the R
PM model. The CP program offers the potentialfor higher capacity revenues, combined with substanti
ally increased penalties for non-performance or under-performance during certain periodsidentified as "capacity performance hours." This linkage b
etween non- or under-performance during specific hours means that a generation unit thatis generally performing well on an an
nual basis, may incur substantial penalties if it happens to be unavailable for service during some capacityperformance hours. Similarly, a generation unit that is general
ly performing poorly on an annual basis may avoid such penalties if its outageshappen to occur only during hours that are not capacity performance h
ours. An annual “stop-loss” provision exists that limits the size of penalties to150% of the net cost of new entry, which is a value computed by PJM. This level is likely to be l
arger than the capacity price established under theCP program, so that there is potential that participation in the CP program could resu
lt in capacity penalties that exceed capacity revenues. Thepurpose of the RPM and CP Program is to enable PJM to obtain sufficient resources to reli
ably meet the needs of electric customers within the PJMfootprint. PJM conducts an auction to establish the price by zone.
The PJM CP auctions are held three years in advance for a perio
d covering 12 months starting from June 1. Auctions for the period coveringJune 1, 2020 through May 30, 2021 are expected to take plac
e in May 2017. Future auction results are dependent upon various factors including thedemand and supply situation, capac
ity additions and retirements and any changes in the current auction rules related to bidding for demandresponse and energy efficiency resources in the cap
acity auctions. For DPL-owned generation, applicable capacity prices through the auction year2019/20 are as follows:

  $127  $159  $145  $135  $132 The above tables reflect the capacity prices after the transitional auctio
ns discussed earlier. Substantially all of DP&L's capacity cleared in theCP auction. The results of these auctions could have a si
gnificant effect on DP&L's revenues in the future.Regulatory Framework - 
Retail Regulation and Rate  Structure — DP&L is subject to regulation by the PUCO, for its distribution services and facilities, retail rates and charges, reliability of service, complia
nce with renewable energy portfolio, energy efficiency program requirements andcertain other matters. DP&L's rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges that are set and approved by the PUCO
after public hearings. In addition, DP&L's rates inc
lude various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, the timely recovery of costsincurred to comply with alternative energy, renewabl
es, energy efficiency, and economic development costs. These components functionindependently of one anoth
er, but the overall structure of DP&L's retail rates and charges are subject to the rules and regulations established by thePUCO.
Since Ohio is deregulated, and al
lows customers to choose retail generation providers, DP&L is required to provide retail generation service atSSO rates to any customer that has not signed a contract with a CRES provider.
18

SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and are established based on DP&L's most recently approved ESP. DP&L's distributionrates are regulated by the PUCO and are established throu
gh a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. DP&L is permitted to recover its costs ofproviding distribution service as wel
l as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowedregulated asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. DP&L's w
holesale transmission rates are regulated by the FERC.Although it had been in effect since Janu
ary 2014, on June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio ("Court") issued an opinion in the appeal ofDP&L’s ESP (ESP 2) that had been approv
ed by the PUCO for the years 2014-2016 and which, among other matters, permitted DP&L to collect anon-bypassable Service Stabi
lity Rider equal to $110 million per year from 2014-2016 and required DP&L to conduct competitive bid auctions toprocure generation supply for SSO service. DP&L's ow
n generation was phased-out of supplying SSO service over the three year period andbeginning January 1, 2016 D
P&L's SSO was 100% sourced through the competitive bid. In the opinion, the Court stated that the PUCO’s approvalof ESP 2 was reversed. In view of that reversal, DP&L filed a motion to withdraw ESP 2 an
d implement rates consistent with those in effect prior to2014 (ESP 1). Those rates will be in effect until rates consistent with DP&
L’s pending February 22, 2016 ESP (ESP 3) filing are approved andeffective.
DP&L originally filed its ESP 3 se
eking an effective date of January 1, 2017. On October 11, 2016, DP&L amended the application requestingto recover $145 million per year for seven years supporting the alternativ
e described in the original filing, named the Distribution ModernizationRider. This plan establishes the terms and conditi
ons for DP&L's SSO beginning June 1, 2017 to customers that do not choose a competitive retailelectric supplier.  In its plan, DP&L recommends includi
ng renewable energy attributes as part of the product that is competitively bid, and seeksrecovery of approximately $11 million of regulatory assets. The pla
n also proposes a new Distribution Investment Rider to allow DP&L to recovercosts associated with future distribution equipment an
d infrastructure needs. Additionally, the plan establishes new riders set initially at zero, relatedto energy reductions from DP&L's energy efficiency programs, and certain env
ironmental liabilities the Company may incur.On January 30, 2017 DP&L, in conjunctio
n with nine intervening parties, filed a settlement in the ESP 3 case, which is subject to PUCOapproval. DP&L and the intervenin
g parties agreed to a six-year settlement that provides a framework for energy rates and defines componentswhich include, but are not limited to, the followin
g:•
The establishment of a five-year Distribution Modernization Rider designed to collect $90 million in revenue per year to pay debt obligations atDPL and DP&L and positio
n DP&L to modernize and/or maintain its transmission and distribution infrastructure;•
The establishment of a Distribution Investment Rider for distribution investments, with one component designed to collect $35 million in revenueper year to enable the implementation of smart grid and advance
d metering, ending after the fifth year of the term of the ESP,•
A commitment by the Company to separate DP&L’s generation assets from its transmission and distribution assets (if approved by FERC);•
A commitments to commence the sale process of our ownership interests in the Zimmer, Miami Fort and Conesville coal-fired generation plantsand;
•
A commitment to develop or procure wind and/or solar energy projects in Ohio,•
Restrictions on DPL making dividend or tax sharing payments, various other riders, and competitive retail market enhancements.A hearing on the stipulation has be
en scheduled for March 2017. A final decision by the PUCO is expected at the end of Q2 or early Q3 2017.If the PUCO agrees to the proposed settlement, the average residential customer in the DP&
L service territory, using 1,000 kWh on DP&L'sStandard Service Offer, can expect a monthly bill increase of $2.39. There can be n
o assurance that the ESP 3 stipulation will be approved as filedor on a timely basis, and if the final ESP provides for terms that are more adverse than those submitted in DP&L's stip
ulation, our results ofoperations, financial conditio
n and cash flows could be materially impacted.On November 30, 2015 DP&L filed an app
lication to increase its distribution rate case using a 12-month test year of June 1, 2015 to May 31,2016 to measure revenue and expenses a
nd a date certain of September 30, 2015 to measure its asset base. The Company is seeking an increaseto distribution revenues of $66 million per year. The Comp
any has asked for recovery of certain regulatory assets as well as two new riders thatwould allow the Company to recover certain costs on an o
ngoing basis. It has proposed a modified straight-fixed variable rate design in an effort todecouple distribution revenu
es from electric sales. If approved as filed the rates are expected to have a total bill impact of approximately 4% on atypical residential customer.
Environmental Regulation 
— In relation to MATS, DPL does not expect to incur material capital expend itures to ensure compliance. For moreinformation see Item 1. 
—United States Environmental and Lan d-Use Legislation19

and Regulations . Key Financial Drivers 
— DPL financial results are driven by retail demand, we ather, energy efficiency and wholesale prices on financial results.In addition, DPL financial results are like
ly to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:•
PJM capacity prices•
Outcome of DP&L's pending ESP 3 case, including the amount of non-bypassable revenue•
Outcome of DP&L's pending distribution rate case•
Operational performance of generation facilities•
Recovery in the power market, particularly as it relates to an expansion in dark spreads•
Sale or transfer to a DPL affiliate of DP&L generation assets•
DPL's ability to reduce its cost structureConstruction and Development 
— Planned construction additions primari ly relate to new investments in and upgrades to DP&L's power plantequipment and transmission and distributi
on system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financialand economic conditions, load forecasts, leg
islative and regulatory developments and changing environmental standards, among other factors.DPL is projecting to spend an estimated $41
4 million in capital projects for the period 2017 through 2019 with 65% attributable to Transmissionand Distribution. DPL's ability to complete ca
pital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by its financial condition, the availabilityof internal funds and the reasonable cost of external funds. We expect to financ
e these construction additions with a combination of cash on hand,short-term financing, long-term debt and cash flows from operations.
U.S. Generation
Business Description 
— In the U.S., we own a diversified generation portfolio in terms of geography, techn ology and fuel source. The principalmarkets and locations where we are engage
d in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the Western Electric CoordinatingCouncil, PJM, Southwest Power Pool Electric En
ergy Network and Hawaii. AES Southland, in the Western Electric Coordinating Council, is our mostsignificant generating
 business.Many of our U.S. generation plants provide baselo
ad operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability. Any change inavailability has a direct impact on financi
al performance. The plants are generally eligible for availability bonuses on an annual basis if they meetcertain requirements. In addition to plant availab
ility, fuel cost is a key business driver for some of our facilities.AES Southland
Business Description 
— In terms of aggregate installed capacity, AES Southland is o ne of the largest generation operators in California, withan installed gross capacity of 3,941 MW, accounting for approximately 5% of the state's insta
lled capacity and 17% of the peak demand of SouthernCalifornia Edison. The three coastal po
wer plants comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an importantrole in integrating the increasing amou
nts of renewable generation resources in California.Market Structure 
— All of AES Southland's capacity is contracted throu gh a long-term agreement (the “Tolling Agreement”), which expires inMay 31, 2018. A Resource Adequacy agreement has b
een executed that covers the period from June 1, 2018 through 2020, but it is still subject toapproval from the California Public Utiliti
es Commission. Under the current Tolling Agreement, AES Southland's largest revenue driver is unitavailability, as approximately 98% of its revenue comes from avail
ability-related payments. Historically, AES Southland has generally met orexceeded its contractual availabi
lity requirements under the Tolling Agreement and may capture bonuses for exceeding availability requirements inpeak periods.
Under the Tolling Agreement, the offtaker provides gas to the three facilities thus A
ES Southland is not exposed to significant fuel price risk. Ifthe units operate better than the guaranteed efficiency, AES So
uthland gets credit for the gas that is not consumed. Conversely, AES Southland isresponsible for the cost of fuel in excess of what would have be
en consumed had the guaranteed efficiency been achieved. The business is alsoexposed to replacement power costs for a limited period if dispatch
ed by the offtaker and not able to meet the required generation.AES Southland delivers el
ectricity into the California ISO's market through its Tolling Agreement counterparty.20

Environmental Regulation — For a discussion of environmental regulatory matters affecting U.S. Generation, see Item 1. —United States Environmental and Land-U
se Legislation and Regulations.Re-powering 
— In October 2014, AES Southland was awarded 2 0-year contracts by SCE to provide 1,284 MW of combined cycle gas-firedgeneration and 100 MW of interconnected battery-based e
nergy storage. In addition to replacing older gas-fired plants with more efficient gas-firedcapacity, SCE chose advanced energy storag
e as a cost effective way to ensure critical power system reliability. This new storage resource willprovide operational flexibi
lity, enabling the efficient dispatch of other generating plants, lowering cost and emissions and supporting the on-goingaddition of renewable powe
r sources.This new capacity will be built at the Compa
ny's existing power plant sites in Huntington Beach and Alamitos Beach. For the gas-fired capacity,financing agreements are expected to be complete
d in mid-2017 with construction expected to begin shortly thereafter, and commercial operationscheduled for 2020. For the energy storage capacity, commercial operati
on is scheduled for 2021.AES is pursuing permits to build both the gas-fired and e
nergy storage capacity and will complete the licensing process before financial close.The total cost for these projects is expected to be approximately $1.9 billi
on, which will be funded with a combination of non-recourse debtand AES equity.
Key Financial Drivers 
— AES Southland's contractual avai lability is the single most important driver of operations. Its units are generallyrequired to achieve at least 86% availab
ility in each contract year. AES Southland has historically met or exceeded its contractual availability.Additional U.S. Generation Businesses
Business Description 
— Additional businesses inc lude thermal, wind, and solar generating facilities, of which AES Hawaii, our U.S. windgeneration businesses and d
istributed solar are the most significant.•
AES Hawaii — AES Hawaii receives a fuel payment from its offtaker under a PPA expiring i n 2022, which is based on a fixed rate indexed to theGross National Product - Implicit Price Deflator. Since the fuel payment is not directly linke
d to market prices for fuel, the risk arising fromfluctuations in market prices for coal is borne by AES Hawaii.
To mitigate the risk from such fluctuations, AES Hawaii has entered into fixed-pric
e coal purchase commitments that end in December 2018; thebusiness could be subject to variabi
lity in coal pricing beginning in January 2019. To mitigate fuel risk beyond December 2018, AES Hawaii plansto seek additional fuel purchase commitments on favorabl
e terms. However, if market prices rise and AES Hawaii is unable to procure coalsupply on favorable terms, the financial performance of AES Haw
aii could be materially and adversely affected.•
U.S. Wind — AES has 736 MW of wind capacity in the U.S., located in Californi a, Texas and West Virginia. Typically, these facilities sell underlong-term PPAs. AES financed most of these projects with tax equity structures. The tax equity investors receive a portion of the eco
nomicattributes of the facilities, including tax attributes that vary over the life of the projects. Based on certain liq
uidation provisions of the tax equitystructures, this could result in a net loss to AES consolidated results in peri
ods in which the facilities report net income. These non cash netlosses will be expected to reverse during the life of the facil
ities. Some of the wind projects are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and theirrevenue may change materially as energy prices fluctuate i
n their respective markets of operations.Buffalo Gap is located in Texas and is comprised of three win
d projects with an aggregate generation capacity of 522 MW. Each wind projectoperates its own PPA with the exception of Buffalo Gap III. The energy price of the entire producti
on of Buffalo Gap I is guaranteed by a PPAexpiring in 2021. The PPA of Buffalo Gap II guarantees the e
nergy price of 80% of the installed capacity while the energy price for the remaining20% is dictated by the prices in the ERCOT market. The PPA of Buffalo Gap II expires in December 2017. Once the PP
As expire, the entireinstalled capacity of Buffalo Gap will be ex
posed to the volatility of energy prices in the ERCOT market which could adversely affect revenues.Laurel Mountain is a wind project locate
d in West Virginia with an installed capacity of 98 MW. Laurel Mountain does not operate under a long-term contract and sells its entire capacity and power generated into the PJM market. The volatility an
d fluctuations of energy prices in PJM havea direct impact in the results of Laurel Mountain.
AES manages the wind portfolio as part of its broader investments in the U.S., leverag
ing operational and commercial resources to supplementthe experienced subject matter experts in the wind industry to achiev
e optimal results.21

•AES Distributed Energy — AES has 103 MW of solar capacity in the U.S., located across multiple states. Distributed Energy's C ommercial andUtility division, which comprised 89 MW of solar capacity as of December 31, 20
16, sells electricity generated by photovoltaic solar energysystems to public sector, utility, and non-profit entities through power purchase agre
ements. AES has added 33 MW of commercial and utilitycapacity in 2016. A majority of this new capacity has been fin
anced with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the tax equityinvestors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, includ
ing tax attributes that vary over the life of the projects. Based oncertain liquidation provisio
ns of the tax equity structures, this could result in a net loss to AES consolidated results in periods in which the facilitiesreport net income. These non cash net losses will be exp
ected to reverse during the life of the facilities.AES manages the Distributed Energy portfolio as p
art of its broader investments in the U.S., leveraging operational and commercial resources tosupplement the experienced subj
ect matter experts in the solar industry to achieve optimal results.Market Structure 
— For the non-renewable businesses inc luded in our additional U.S. generation facilities, coal and natural gas are used asthe primary fuels. Coal has prices that are set by market factors internationally while natural gas is g
enerally set domestically. Price variations forthese fuels can change the composition of gen
eration costs and energy prices in our generation businesses, and the prices of these fuels have beensubject to volatility in recent years.
Many of these generation businesses have e
ntered into long-term PPAs with utilities or other offtakers. Some coal-fired power plantbusinesses in the U.S. with PPAs have mechan
isms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment that is partially based onthe market price of coal. In addition, these businesses often have an op
portunity to increase or decrease profitability from payments under theirPPAs depending on such items as pl
ant efficiency and availability, heat rate, ability to buy coal at lower costs through AES' global sourcing programand fuel flexibility. Revenue may chan
ge materially as prices in fuel markets fluctuate, but the variable margin or profitability should not be materiallychanged when market price fluctuations in fuel are b
orne by the offtaker.Regulatory Framework 
— Several of our generation businesses in the U.S. currently op erate as QFs as defined under the PURPA. Thesebusinesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that ha
d a mandatory obligation under PURPA requirements to purchase powerfrom QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for both energy and capital investment that would have be
en incurred by the purchasingutility if that utility had to provide its own generating capac
ity or purchase it from another source). To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produceelectricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heati
ng or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility'stotal energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power productio
n facility must generally use a renewable resource asits energy input and meet certain size criteria.
Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholes
ale Generators as defined under EPAct 1992. Thesebusinesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell p
ower at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the FPA and FERC's regulatio
ns, approval from FERC to sell wholesalepower at market-based rates is generally depende
nt upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission,that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions invo
lvingregulated affiliates of the seller. To prevent market manipulation, FER
C requires sellers with market-based rate authority to file certain reports,including a triennial up
dated market power analysis for markets in which they control certain threshold amounts of generation.Other Regulatory Matters 
— The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct region al markets that are subject to both federalregulation, as implemented by the U.S. FERC, and regio
nal regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the RTOs, non-profitcorporations that operate the regional transmission grid a
nd maintain organized markets for electricity. These rules for the most part govern suchitems as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guide
lines andincentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A.— 
Risk Factors for additional discussion on U.S. regul atory matters.Environmental Regulation 
— For a discussion of environmental laws and regu lations affecting the U.S. business, see Item 1.— United States Environmental and Land-U
se Legislation and Regulations . Key Financial Drivers 
— U.S. Generation's financial results are driven by fuel costs and outa ges. The Company has entered into long-term fuelcontracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating prices. In addition, major maintena
nce requiring units to be off-line is performed duringperiods when power demand is typica
lly lower. The financial results of U.S. Wind are primarily driven by increased production due to faster and less22

turbulent wind, and reduced turbine outages. In addition, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results for the wind projects that areoperating without long-term contracts for all or some of their capacity.
Construction and Development 
— Planned capital projects inclu de the AES Southland re-powering described above. In addition to the newconstruction projects, U.S. Generation performs capital projects related to major plant maintena
nce, repairs, and upgrades to be compliant with newenvironmental laws and
 regulations.Andes SBU

Andes Businesses
Chile
Business Description 
— In Chile, through AES Gener, we are engaged in the g eneration and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in thetwo principal markets: the SIC and SING. In terms of aggregate installed capacity, AES Gener is the second l
argest generation operator in Chilewith a calculated installed cap
acity of 4,131 MW, excluding energy storage and TermoAndes, and a market share of approximately 18% as ofDecember 31, 2016.
AES Gener owns a diversified generatio
n portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers and fuel source. AES Gener'sinstalled capacity is located near the princ
ipal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso and Antofagasta. AES Gener'sportfolio is composed of hydroelectric, coal, gas, diesel, solar ph
otovoltaic and biomass facilities, that allows the businesses to operate under avariety of market and hydrological conditions, manag
e AES Gener's contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers and, asrequired, provide backup energy to the spot market.
AES Gener has experienced signific
ant growth in recent years by responding to market opportunities. The company successfully completed afirst expansion phase between 200
7 and 2014 that added 6 new power plants totaling 1,677 MW. It continued to grow in Chile through its secondexpansion phase that will ad
d 1,236 MW. As of the end of 2016, AES Gener has completed the construction of Guacolda Unit 5 (152 MW),Cochrane (532 MW) and Andes Solar (21 MW). Additionally, we conti
nue to advance in the construction of the 531 MW Alto Maipo run-of-the-riverhydroelectric plant in the SIC.
Our commercial policy in Chile aims to maximize margin while red
ucing cash flow volatility. In order to achieve this, we contract a significantportion of our baseload capacity, currently coal and hy
droelectric, under long-term agreements with a diversified customer base, that includes bothregulated and unregulated customers. Pow
er plants that are not considered within our baseload capacity (higher variable cost units, mainly dieseland gas fired
24

units) operate during scarce system supply conditions, such as dry hydrological conditions and plant outages, selling their energy in the spot market.In Chile, sales on the spot market are made only to other generation compan
ies (entities that are members of the Economic Load Dispatch Center -"CISEN") at the system marginal cost. In anticipation of the SIC and SING interconnection, the new Transmission L
aw created the CISEN, an entitythat will merge both system operators into one.
AES Gener currently has long-term contracts, with an average remaining term of approximately 11 years, with regu
lated distributioncompanies and unregulated customers, such as mini
ng and industrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include both fixed andvariable payments along with ind
exation mechanisms that periodically adjust prices based on the generation cost structure related to the UnitedStates Consumer Price Index, the international price of coal, and i
n some cases, with pass-through of fuel and regulatory costs, including changes inlaw.
In addition to energy payments, AES Gener also receives firm capacity payments for contributin
g to the system's ability to meet peak demand.These payments are added to the final electricity price pai
d by both unregulated and regulated customers. In each system, the CISEN annuallydetermines the firm capacity amount allocated to each power pla
nt. A plant's firm capacity is defined as the capacity that it can guarantee at peakhours during critical conditions, such as droug
hts, taking into account statistical information regarding maintenance periods and water inflows in thecase of hydroelectric plants. The capacity price is fixed by the Nation
al Energy Commission in the semiannual node price report and indexed to theUnited States Consumer Price Index and other relevant in
dices.Market Structure 
— Chile has two main power systems, largely as a result of its geographic sha pe and size. The SIC is the largest of thesesystems, with an installed capacity of 17,543 MW as of December 31, 2016. The SIC serves approximate
ly 92% of the Chilean population, includingthe densely populated Santi
ago Metropolitan Region, and represents 75% of the country's electricity demand. The SING serves about 6% of theChilean populatio
n, representing 25% of Chile's electricity consumption, and mainly supplies mining companies.In 2016, thermoelectric generation represented 67% of the total gen
eration in Chile. In the SIC, thermoelectric generation represents 48% ofinstalled capacity, required to fulfill deman
d not satisfied by hydroelectric output and is critical to guaranteeing reliable and dependable electricitysupply under dry hydrological con
ditions. In the SING, which includes the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, thermoelectric capacityrepresents 92% of installed capacity. The fuels used for generati
on, mainly coal, diesel and LNG, are indexed to international prices.In the SIC, where hydroelectric plants represent a large part of the system's installed capac
ity, hydrological conditions largely influence plantdispatch and, therefore, spot market prices, given that river inflows, snow melting and initi
al water levels in reservoirs largely determine the dispatchof the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants. Rai
nfall and snowfall occur in Chile principally in the southern cone winter season(June to August) and during the remainder of the year precipitation is scarce. When rai
n is abundant, energy produced by hydroelectric plants canamount to more than 70% of total generation. In 2016 hydroelectric generati
on represented 36% of total energy production within the SIC, and 27%of the country’s total energy production.
Solar and wind installed ca
pacity represents a small but growing part of the total capacity installed. In the SIC, solar accounts for 3% of thepower generation and 7% of the system’s installed ca
pacity while in the SING solar accounts for 4% of the power generation and 6% of the system’scapacity. As for wind, in the SIC, wind contributes with 4% of the power generatio
n and 7% of the system’s capacity, while in the SING windgeneration represents 1% of the power generation a
nd with 2% of the system’s capacity.Regulatory Framework 
— The government entity that has primary responsibility for the Chilean el ectricity system is the Ministry of Energy,acting directly or through the National Energy Commissi
on and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels. The electricity sector is divided intothree segments: generation, transmission and distribution. In gen
eral terms, generation and transmission expansion are subject to marketcompetition, while transmission operation a
nd distribution, are subject to price regulation. The transmission segment consists of companies thattransmit the electricity produced by generation companies at hi
gh voltage. The individual and joint participation of companies operating in any othersegment of the electricity sector cannot exceed 8% and 40%, respectively, of the total investment value of the nati
onal transmission system.Companies in the SIC and the SING that own generatio
n, transmission, sub-transmission or additional transmission facilities, as well asunregulated customers directly connected to transmission facil
ities, are coordinated through the CISEN, which minimizes the operating costs of theelectricity system, while meeting all service quality and rel
iability requirements. The principal purpose of the CISEN is to ensure that the mostefficient electricity generation availab
le to meet demand is dispatched to customers. The CISEN dispatches plants in merit order based on theirvariable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be sup
plied at the lowest available cost.25

All generators can commercialize energy through contracts with distribution companies for their regulated and unregulated customers ordirectly with unregulated customers. Unregulated customers are customers whos
e connected capacity is higher than 2MW. Customers withconnected capacity between 0.5 MW and 2.0 MW can opt for a Regulated or Unreg
ulated regime for a minimum period of four years. By law, bothregulated and unregulated customers are requ
ired to purchase all of their electricity requirements under contract. Generators may also sell energyto other power generation companies on a short-term basis. Power gen
eration companies may engage in contracted sales among themselves atnegotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chil
e, under contract and on the spot market, are denominated in U.S. Dollars,although payments a
re made in Chilean Pesos.In July 2016, modifications to the Transmission Law were en
acted. This Law establishes that the transmission system will be completely paidfor by the end-users, gradually allocating the costs on the deman
d side from year 2019 through 2034.Environmental Regulation 
— In 2011, a regulation on air emission standards for thermoelectric pow er plants became effective. This regulationprovides for stringent limits on emission of PM and gases produced by the comb
ustion of solid and liquid fuels, particularly coal. For existing plants,including those currently under construction, the ne
w limits for PM emissions went into effect at the end of 2013, and the new limits for SO 2 , NO x and mercury emission were in effect since mid-2016, except for those plants operatin
g in zones declared saturated or latent zones (areas at risk ofor affected by excessive air pollution), where these emission l
imits became effective in June 2015. In order to comply with the new emissionstandards, AES Gener initiated investments in Chil
e at its older coal facilities (Ventanas I and II and Norgener I and II, constructed between 1964and 1997) in 2012. As of December 31, 2016, AES Gen
er has concluded investments of approximately $229 million in order to comply within therequired time frame. Additionally, its equity method investee Guaco
lda started the installation of new emission control equipment during 2013, andconcluded investments of approximately $20
9 million in order to comply within the required time frame.On March 29, 2016, the Health Ministry enacted Supreme Decree N°43 (“DS 43”) ruling “Storag
e of Hazardous Materials”, modifying thecurrent applicable rules. This regulatio
n will become fully effective in March 2018 for structural improvements of currently authorized storagefacilities. The estimated investment required to comply with DS 43 wo
uld be approximately $15 million.During 2016, the Environmental Ministry worked on u
pgrading the Atmospheric Decontamination Plans for Santiago, Ventanas and Huascoareas, each of which, as of December 31, 2016, are currently under different stages of progress. Nueva Re
nca, Ventanas and Guacolda powerplants may require an improvement of their operational practices an
d additional investments to meet the expected new requirements during the yearfollowing the enactment of the Decontaminatio
n Plan, which is expected for mid 2017.Chilean law requires every electricity ge
nerator to supply a certain portion of its total contractual obligations with Non-conventional RenewableEnergy ("NCREs"). In October 2013, the NCRE law was amended, increasi
ng the NCRE requirements. The law distinguishes between energycontracts executed before and after July 1, 2013. For contracts executed between Aug
ust 31, 2007 and July 1, 2013, the NCRE requirement isequal to 5% in 2014 with annua
l contract increases of 0.5% until reaching 10% in 2024. The NCRE requirement for contracts executed after July 1,2013 is equal to 5% in 2013, with ann
ual increases of 1% thereafter until reaching 12% in 2020, and subsequently annual increases of 1.5% until itis equal to 20% in 2025. Generation compan
ies are able to meet this requirement by developing their own NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar,biomass, geothermal and small hydroelectric techno
logy), purchasing NCREs from qualified generators or by paying the applicable fines for non-compliance. AES Gener currently fulfills the NCRE requ
irements by utilizing AES Gener's own solar and biomass power plants and by purchasingNCREs from other generation companies. It has sold certain water rights to companies that are dev
eloping small hydro projects, entering into powerpurchase agreements with these companies in ord
er to promote development of these projects, while at the same time meeting the NCRErequirements. At present, AES Gener is in the process of negotiating additi
onal NCRE supply contracts to meet the future requirements.In September 2014 a new tax law was enacted. The ne
w law introduces an emission tax, or "green tax", that assesses the emissions of PM,SO 
2 , NO x and CO 2 produced for installations with an installed capacity over 50 MW. The first annual payment shall be made in April 2018 foremissions produced in 2017. In the case of CO 
2 , the tax will be equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. In the SING, all PPAs have "change of law"clauses, which would allo
w the company to transfer this cost to customers. In the SIC, costs can only be passed through to unregulated customers,as existing PPAs with distribution compan
ies do not have change of law clauses. According to its PPAs, the company is currently discussing thepass-through mechanism with each client. Additi
onally, the new tax systems introduced by the new tax laws enacted in February 2016 will beeffective from January 1, 2017 onwards. The statutory income tax rate for most of our Chilean businesses will incre
ase from 25% to 25.5% in 2017and to 27%
26

for 2018 and future years. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and An alysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates 
— Income Taxes for further details of the impacts of these new laws. In June 2015, the Chilean government pu
blished Decree N°7/2015, which allows the export of energy generated by plants not dispatched inthe SING to Argentina using the transmission line conn
ecting the SING with the SADI. This transmission line is owned by AES Gener and has acapacity of approximately 600 MW, but will be operated at 200 MW according to the gov
ernment permit and related technical studies. AES Genersigned an agreement with CAMMESA and C
hilean generators to export electricity to Argentina. In December 2016, Decree N° 7/2015 was amendedto allow the export of energy generated by plants disp
atched into the SING to Argentina. During 2016, energy exported to Argentina reached 102GWh.

— Hedge levels at Gener provide some certainty and clarity on the underlying financial drivers. In addition, financialresults are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:
•
Dry hydrology scenarios reduce hydro generation•
Forced outages may impact earnings•
Changes in current regulatory rulings could alter the ability to pass through or recover certain costs•
AES is exposed to the fluctuation of the Chilean peso, which may pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but someresidual risk to earnings remains
•
Tax policy changes•
Current legislation is trending towards promoting renewable energy and strengthening regulations on thermal generation assets, posing a riskto future coal margins
•
Market price risk when re-contractingConstruction and Development 
— Since 2007, AES Gener has constructed and commission ed approximately 2,400 MW of new capacity,representing a significant portion of the capacity incre
ase in the SIC and SING during the period. During 2016, AES Gener achieved importantmilestones related to the construction of their projects:
•
Cochrane project began operations (Unit 2 on October 12 and Unit 1 on July 9) adding 532 MW to the SING.•
Cochrane Energy Storage began operations in October 2016 adding 20 MW of batteries contributing to system stability in the SING.•
Andes Solar with 21 MW began operations in May 2016Additionally, in the SIC, we continue a
dvancing in the construction of our Alto Maipo project, a 531 MW two unit run-of-river hydroelectricpower plant, adjacent to our existing Alfalfal p
lant, located 50 km from Santiago. Alto Maipo is the largest project in construction in the SIC marketand it includes 67 km of tunnel works, two caverns, 17 km of transmission lines as part of the construction, and is 90% un
derground. Alto Maipo hasthree main contractors and covers three adjacent valleys in the Chi
lean Andes. As of today, the project employs approximately 4,300 people andexpects to reach a peak close to 4,500. The project units are schedul
ed to reach commercial operation in the first half of 2019.We are expanding our business by eval
uating opportunities in the desalination business line through two initiatives: i) brownfield projects,which take advantage of existing infrastructure in thermoelectric po
wer plants (marine works, easy access to power, strategic location, permits, etc.),providing shorter development time lines an
d more competitive water tariffs to offtakers; and ii) greenfield projects, mainly for mining companieswhich either purchase industrial water throug
h water purchase agreements, or either invite external companies to compete in a bidding process todevelop a project under a build-o
wn-operate-and-transfer scheme where the water facility along its pipeline is transferred to the mining operation atthe end of a defined period. In Chile, most of the water demand comes from mining operatio
ns, either directly or indirectly (their service providers),hence negative outlooks in the minera
l markets have translated in the postponement of most of the mining projects and their corresponding waterdemands.
Colombia
Business Description 
— We operate in Colombia through AES Chiv or, a subsidiary of AES Gener, who owns a hydroelectric plant with aninstalled capacity of 1,000 MW, and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric, both located approx
imately 160 km east of Bogota. As ofDecember 31, 2016, AES Chivor's net power prod
uction in reached 4,373 GWh. AES Chivor’s installed capacity accounted for approximately 6.1%of system capacity by the end of the year. Chivor remains dependent on prevail
ing hydrological conditions in the region in which it operates.Hydrological conditions l
argely influence generation and the spot prices at which AES Chivor sells its non-27

contracted generation in Colombia.AES Chivor's commercial strategy aims to reduce margin volatility by sell
ing a significant portion of the expected generation under short termcontracts, mainly with distribution companies. These contracts are awarde
d in public auctions and normally last from one to three years. Theremaining generation is sold on the sp
ot market to other generation and trading companies at the system marginal cost, allowing us to maximize theoperating margin. Additionally, AE
S Chivor receives reliability payments to compensate for the plant availability during periods of power scarcity,such as adverse hydrological cond
itions, in order to prevent power shortages.Market Structure 
— Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated i n one main system, the SIN which encompasses one-third of Colombia'sterritory, providing coverage to 97% of the country's population. The SIN's i
nstalled capacity totaled 16,690 MW as of December 31, 2016,comprised of 70% hydroelectric generation, 29% thermoelectric ge
neration and 1% other. The dominance of hydroelectric generation and themarked seasonal variations in Colomb
ia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2016, 72% of total energy demand wassupplied by hydroelectric plants with the remai
ning supply from thermoelectric generation of 27% and cogeneration and self-generation power of1%. From 2003 to 2016, electricity demand in the SIN has grown at a compound a
nnual growth rate of 2.9% and the Mining and Energetic PlanningUnit projects an average compound ann
ual growth rate in electricity demand of 3.0% per year for the next 10 years.Regulatory Framework 
— Since 1994, the electricity sector in Colombia has op erated under a competitive market framework for the generationand sale of electricity and a regulated framework for transmission and distrib
ution. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed byvarious laws as well as the regulations a
nd technical standards issued by the CREG. Other government entities that play an important role in theelectricity industry include the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which d
efines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public UtilitySuperintendency of Colombia, wh
ich is in charge of overseeing and inspecting the utility companies; and the Mining and Energetic Planning Unit,which is in charge of planning the ex
pansion of the generation and transmission network.The generation sector is organized on a competitiv
e basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-termprice or under bilateral contracts with other participants, includ
ing distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers atfreely negotiated prices. Generation companies must submit price bi
ds and report the quantity of energy available on a daily basis. The NationalDispatch Center dispatches generators in merit order based o
n bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest costcombination of available
 generating units.Regulatory Framework 
- Tax Regulation — On December 29, 2016, Law 1819 was enacted in C olombia, which introduced a tax reform withseveral changes in the Colombia
n tax system, and became effective on January 1, 2017. This tax reform reduced the statutory corporate tax rate ofcompanies to 40% in 2017, 37% in 2018, an
d 33% in 2019 onwards. The law also created a new withholding tax on dividend distributions based ona tax rate of 5% 
,  applicable on distribution of Colombian profits generated from the taxable year 2017 onwards.Other Regulatory Considerations 
— After the phenomenon of El Niño put the energy supply at risk, regulatory ag encies and the governmenthave carried out various studies to make adjustments to the market. The subjects susceptible to revisi
on include the following:•
Adjustments to the scarcity price so that it reflects a true value of thermal plants that operate in periods of crisis.•
A plan to implement an option to assign firm energy obligations without the need for reliability auctions but with obligation of signing energycontracts with non-regulated demand.
•
Possible participation of renewable plants in the market and its effect in the formation of prices and operation of the market.•
The implementation of the standardized contract market, and•
The possibility of entering into the intraday markets and markets of the previous day are still being considered.Other topics that the regulator could analyze in 2017, but with a seco
ndary priority are: An international interconnection scheme, review of theAGC market and analysis of other ancillary services, and possib
le modification of the current regulation for emergency situations.Key Financial Drivers 
— Hydrological conditions larg ely influence Chivor's generation level. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, whileworking to maximize revenue, through sale of excess generati
on, is key to Chivor's results of operations Hedge levels at Chivor provide certaintyand clarity on the underlying financi
al drivers, hedging the net cash flows of Chivor, up to 90%. In addition to hydrology financial results are likely tobe driven by many factors including, but not limited to:
28

•Forced outages may impact earnings•
AES is exposed to fluctuation of the Colombian peso, which pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some residual riskto earnings remains
•
Chivor has exposure to the spot market as hedge levels are lower in the futureConstruction and Development 
— In Colombia, AES Gener completed the construction of the Tunjita project in June 2016 that added 20 MWof capacity to the Chivor plant.
Argentina
Business Description 
— As of December 31, 2016, AES Argentina operates 4,105 MW which repres ents 12% of the country's total installedcapacity. The installed capacity in the SADI inc
ludes the TermoAndes plant, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which is connected both to the SADI andthe Chilean SING. AES Argentina has a div
ersified generation portfolio of ten generation facilities, comprised of 68% thermoelectric and 32%hydroelectric capacity. All of the thermoelectric capacity has the capab
ility to burn alternative fuels. Approximately 76% of the thermoelectriccapacity can operate with natural gas or diesel o
il, and the remaining 24% can operate with natural gas, fuel oil, or coal.AES Argentina primarily sells its production to the wh
olesale electric market where prices are largely regulated. In 2016, approximately 94% ofthe energy was sold in the wholesal
e electric market and 6% was sold under contract, as a result of the Energy Plus sales made by TermoAndes.All of the thermoelectric facilities not affected by the Resolution 95/2
013, a regulation passed in March 2013 discussed below, including theportion of TermoAndes plant committed to Energy Plus Contracts, are able to use natural g
as and receive gas supplied through contracts withArgentine producers. In recent years, gas supply restrictions in Argentina, particu
larly during the winter season, have affected some of the plants,such as the TermoAndes plant. The TermoAndes plant commence
d operations in 2000, selling exclusively into the Chilean SING. In 2008, followingrequirements from the Argentine authorities, TermoAndes connected its two gas turbi
nes to the SADI, while maintaining its steam turbine connectedto the SING. However, since December 2011, TermoAndes has been se
lling the plant's full capacity in the SADI.Market Structure 
— The SADI electricity market is managed by CAMMESA. As of December 31, 2016, the installe d capacity of the SADItotaled 33,901 MW. In 2016, 66% of total energy demand was suppli
ed by thermoelectric plants, 26% by hydroelectric plants and 8% from nuclear,wind and solar plants.
Thermoelectric generation in the SADI is princip
ally fueled by natural gas. However, since 2004 due to natural gas shortages, in addition toincreasing electricity demand, the use of alternative fuels i
n thermoelectric generation, such as oil and coal, has increased. Given the importance ofhydroelectric facilities in the SADI, hydrologic
al conditions determining river flow volumes and initial water levels in reservoirs largely influencehydroelectric and thermoelectric plant dispatch. Rai
nfall occurs principally in the southern cone winter season (June to August).Regulatory Framework 
— The Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into gen eration, transmission and distribution. Thewholesale electric market is made up of generation comp
anies, transmission companies, distribution companies and large customers who areallowed to buy and sell electricity. Generatio
n companies can sell their output in the short-term market or to customers in the contract market.CAMMESA is responsible for dispatch coordin
ation and determination of short-term prices. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in chargeof regulating public service activities an
d the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, through the Energy Secretariat, regulatessystem dispatch and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities.
Since 2001, significant modificatio
ns have been made to the electricity regulatory framework. These modifications include the freezing oftariffs, the cancellation of inflation adjustment mechanisms and the i
ntroduction of a complex pricing system in the wholesale electric market, whichhave materially affected electricity generators, transporters and distributors, and generate
d substantial price differences within the market. Since2004, as a result of energy market reforms and overdue accounts receivables owe
d by the government to generators operating in Argentina, AESArgentina contributed certain accounts receiva
bles to fund the construction of new power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. Thesereceivables accrue interest and are collected i
n monthly installments over 10 years once the related plants begin operations. At this point, threefunds have been created to construct three facilities. The three plants are operati
ng and payments are being received. AES Argentina will receive apro rata ownership interest in these newly built pl
ants once the accounts receivables have been paid. See Item 7.— Capital Resources and Liquidi ty—Long-Term Receivables 
and Note 7 —Financing Receivables for further discussion of receivables in Argentina. 29

In March 2013, the Secretariat of Energy released Resolution 95/2013, which affects the remuneration of generators whose sales prices hadbeen frozen since 2003. This regulatio
n is applicable to generation companies with certain exceptions. It defined a compensation system based oncompensating for fixed costs, non-fuel variable costs and an ad
ditional margin. Resolution 95/2013 converted the Argentine electric market to an"average cost" compensation scheme.
Thermal units must achieve an availabil
ity target, which varies by technology, in order to receive full fixed cost revenues. The Resolution alsoestablished that all fuels, except coal, are to be provide
d by CAMMESA. Thermoelectric natural gas plants not affected by the Resolution, such asTermoAndes, are able to purchase gas directly from the producers for Energy Plus sales.
In May 2014, the Argentine government passed Resol
ution No. 529/214 ("Resolution 529") which retroactively updated the prices ofResolution 95/2013 to February 1, 2014, cha
nged target availability and added a remuneration for non-periodic maintenance. This remuneration isaimed to cover the expenses that the generator incurs when performing major mainte
nances in its units. Since 2014, this resolution has beenupdated annually, the most recent of which was issue
d in March 2016.On February 2, 2017, the Ministry of Energy issued Resolution 19/20
17 establishing changes to the Energia Base price framework. Effective inFebruary 2017, the framework will maintain the current tolling agre
ement structure, as fuels will continue to be sourced by CAMMESA. A keychange will be introduced to the tariff structure which will n
ow have prices set in USD and also eliminates all future non-cash retention of margins.In December 2015, the finance minister lifted foreign currency controls, allo
wing the peso to float under the administration of ArgentineanCentral Bank. The newly freed currency fell by more than 30%. Over the course of 2016, the Argentine
an Peso devalued by approximately 22%. AtDecember 31, 2016, all transactions at our businesses i
n Argentina were translated using the official exchange rate published by the ArgentineCentral Bank. See Note 7— 
Financing Receivables in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information on the long-term receivables. Further weakenin
g of the Argentine Peso and local economic activity could cause significant volatility inour results of operations, cash flows, the ability to pay dividends to the Pare
nt Company, and the value of our assets.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to:• 
Forced outages may impact earnings • 
FX exposure to fluctuations of the Argentine Peso • 
Hydrology •
Timely collection of FONINVEMEM installment and outstanding receivables (See Note 7— Financing Receivables in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
for further discussion) •

Business Description 
— Eletropaulo distributes electricity to the greater São Paul o area, Brazil's main economic and financial center. AESowns 17% of the economic interest in Eletropaulo, our partner, BND
ES, owns 19% and the remaining shares are publicly held or held bygovernment-related entities. On December 30, 2016 AES purch
ased par shares from BNDES and increased its participation in Eletropaulo from16% to 17%. 
AES is the controlling sharehold er and manages and consolidates this business. Eletropaulo holds a 30-year concession that expiresin 2028. In December 2016, Eletropaulo u
nderwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to, among other things, prepare for the listing of itsshares on the Novo Mercado, a segment of the Brazilian stock exchang
e.Regulatory Framework — In Brazil, ANEEL, a government agency, sets the tariff for each distribution company b
ased on a return on assetbase methodology, which also be
nchmarks operational costs against other distribution companies. The tariff charged to regulated customersconsists of two elements: (i) pass-through of non-manageable costs under a determin
ed methodology ("Parcel A"), including energy purchase costs,sector charges and transmission and distribution system expens
es; and (ii) a manageable cost component ("Parcel B"), including operation andmaintenance costs (defined by ANEEL), recovery of investments and a compo
nent for a return to the distributor. The return to distributors iscalculated as the net asset base multiplied by the reg
ulatory weighted-average cost of capital, which is set for all industry participants during eachtariff reset cycle. The current regulatory weighted-average cost of capital for Eletropaulo, after tax, is 8.1%.
Each year ANEEL reviews each distributor's tariff for an annua
l tariff adjustment. The annual tariff adjustments allow for pass-through of ParcelA costs and inflation impacts on Parcel B costs, adjusted for expected efficie
ncy gains and quality performances. Distribution companies arerequired to contract between 100% and 105% of antici
pated energy needs through the regulated auction market. If contracted levels fall belowrequired levels distribution compan
ies may be subject to limitations on the pass-through treatment of energy purchase costs as well as penalties. Asthe costs incurred on energy purchases made by our distribution comp
any are passed through31

to customers with adjustments on a yearly basis, working capital can be sensitive to significant increases in energy prices. In order to reducepotential working capital nee
ds, in 2015 ANEEL established the tariff flag mechanism, which allows temporary tariff changes to customers on amonthly basis depending on e
nergy purchase prices. The resources collected by the tariff flag mechanism are centralized in an account and sharedamong distribution companies in prop
ortion to their respective exposure to the spot market.Every four years, ANEEL resets each distributor's tariff to incorporate the revised regulatory weighte
d-average cost of capital anddetermination of the distributor's net asset base as well as operati
onal costs. Eletropaulo's tariff reset occurs every four years and the next tariffreset will be in July 2019. The 4 
th Tariff Reset for AES Eletropaulo occurred on July 4, 2015, representing an average tariff increase of 15.23%.Between the tariff reset periods, the regulator applies the annu
al adjustments. On July 4, 2016 ANEEL approved a negative tariff adjustmentfor Eletropaulo, mainly due to a decrease in energy p
urchase and sector charges costs. The average tariff decrease was 8.1% . In 2013, ANEEL challenge
d the parameters of a tariff reset for Eletropaulo implemented in July 2012 and retroactive to 2011. ANEEL assertedthat during the period between 2007 a
nd 2011, certain assets that were included in the regulatory asset base should not have been included andthat Eletropaulo should refund customers for the return on the disputed assets earn
ed during this period. On December 17, 2013, ANEELdetermined, at the administrative level, that Eletropaulo sho
uld adjust the prior 2007-2011 regulatory asset base and refund customers in theamount of $269 million over a period of up to four tariff processes beginn
ing in July 2014. The Company recognized a regulatory liability ofapproximately $269 million in 2
013, since ANEEL had compelled the Company to refund customers, and started reimbursing customers in July2014. Eletropaulo filed for an administrative a
ppeal requesting ANEEL to reconsider its decision and requested that the decision be suspended untilthe appeal process is completed. The inju
nction was granted and, although for a period was suspended, it has been restored and in effect sinceDecember 2014.
Given ANEEL's failure to suspend the in
junction through the appeals process in the Brazilian courts thus far, the tariff reset resulted inmanagement's reassessment of the probability of refunding customers these d
isputed amounts. Therefore, at this point, the Company considers itonly reasonably possible that El
etropaulo will be required to refund these amounts to customers prior to the ultimate resolution of the pending courtcase. As a result, during 2015, the Company reversed the remaining reg
ulatory liability for this contingency of $161 million. Eletropaulo believes ithas meritorious arguments on this matter and will continue to pursue its obj
ections to ANEEL's rulings vigorously, however there can be noassurance that Ele
tropaulo will prevail.Key Financial Drivers 
— Eletropaulo's financial results is lik ely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:•
Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy sold and energy purchased•
Brazilian economic scenario and tariff increases, impacting energy consumption growth, losses and delinquency•
Quality indicators recovery plan•
Ability of Eletropaulo to pass through costs via productivity gains•
Ability of Eletropaulo to solve involuntary exposure•
Capital structure optimization to reduce leverage and interest costs•
The CTEEP Eletrobrás case (see Item 3.— Legal Proceedings for furthe r information)Eletropaulo is affected by the demand for electricity, which is driven by ec
onomic activity, weather patterns and customers' consumptionbehavior. Operating performance is also driven by the qua
lity of service, efficient management of operating and maintenance costs as well as theability to control non-technical losses. Fina
lly, annual tariff adjustments and periodic tariff resets by ANEEL impact results from operations.Brazil Generation
Business Description 
— Tietê has a portfolio of 12 hydroelectric power plants with total insta lled capacity of 2,658 MW in the state of SãoPaulo. Tietê was privatized in 1999 u
nder a 30-year concession expiring in 2029. AES owns a 24% economic interest in Tietê, our partner, theBNDES, owns 28% and the remaining sh
ares are publicly held or held by government-related entities. AES is the controlling shareholder andmanages and consolidates
 this business.Tietê sold nearly 100% of its physical guarante
e, approximately 11,194 GWh, to Eletropaulo under a long-term PPA, which expired inDecember 2015. The contract was price-adjusted ann
ually for inflation, and as of December32

31, 2015, the price was R$218/MWh. After the expiration of contract with Eletropaulo, Tietê's strategy is to contract most of its physical guarantee,as described in 
Regulatory Framework section below, and sell the remainin g portion in the spot market. Tietê's strategy is reassessed from time totime according to changes in market conditions, hydrolo
gy and other factors. Tietê has been continuously selling its available energy from 2016forward through medium-term bilateral contracts of three to five years.
As of December 31, 2016, Tietê's contracted portfolio position is 9
5% and 88% with average prices of R$157/MWh and R$159/MWh (inflationadjusted until December 2016) for 2016 an
d 2017, respectively. As Brazil is mostly a hydro-based country with energy prices highly tied to thehydrological situation, the deterioratio
n of the hydrology since the beginning of 2014 caused an increase in energy prices going forward. Tietê isclosely monitoring and analyzi
ng system supply conditions to support energy commercialization decisions.Under the concession agreement, Tietê has an ob
ligation to increase its capacity by 15%. Tietê, as well as other concession generators, havenot yet met this requirement due to regulatory, environmental, hydrological a
nd fuel constraints. The state of São Paulo does not have a sufficientpotential for wind power and only has a smal
l remaining potential for hydro projects. As such, the capacity increases in the state will mostly bederived from thermal gas capacity projects. Due to the highly complex process to obtai
n an environmental license for coal projects, Tietê decided tofulfill its obligation with gas-fired projects in l
ine with the federal government plans. Petrobras refuses to supply natural gas and to offer capacity in itspipelines and regasificati
on terminals. Therefore, there are no regulations for natural gas swaps in place, and it is unfeasible to bring natural gas toAES Tietê. A legal case has been in
itiated by the state of São Paulo requiring the investment to be performed. Tietê is in the process of analyzingoptions to meet the obligation.
Uruguaiana is a 640 MW gas-fired combined cycle p
ower plant located in the town of Uruguaiana in the state of Rio Grande do Sul,commissioned in December 2000. AES mana
ges and has a 46% economic interest in the plant with the remaining interest held by BNDES. Theplant's operations were suspend
ed in April 2009 due to the unavailability of gas. AES has evaluated several alternatives to bring gas supply on acompetitive basis to Uruguaiana. One of the challe
nges is the capacity restrictions on the Argentinean pipeline, especially during the winter seasonwhen gas demand in Argentina is very hi
gh. The plant operated on a short-term basis during February and March 2013, March through May 2014,and February through May 2015 due to the short-term supply of LNG for the facility. The plant did not operate in 2
016. Uruguaiana continues towork toward securing gas on a long-term basis.
Market Structure 
— Brazil has installed capacity of 150,136 MW, which is 65% hy droelectric, 19% thermal and 16% renewable (biomass andwind). Brazil's national grid is divi
ded into four subsystems. Tietê is in the Southeast and Uruguaiana is in the South subsystems of the national grid.Regulatory Framework 
— In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the maximum amount of energy that a plant can sell, called physical guarantee, which represents the lo
ng-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, physical guarantee canbe sold to distribution companies through l
ong-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energytrading companies.
The National System Operator ("ONS") is responsible for coordinating and co
ntrolling the operation of the national grid. The ONS dispatchesgenerators based on hydrologica
l conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand and the prices of fuel and thermal generation. Given theimportance of hydro generation in the country, the ONS sometimes reduces dispatch of hydro faci
lities and increases dispatch of thermal facilities toprotect reservoir levels in the system.
In Brazil, the system operator controls all hydroelectric generation disp
atch and reservoir levels. A mechanism known as the EnergyReallocation Mechanism ("MRE") was created to share hydrolog
ical risk across MRE hydro generators. If the hydro plants generate less than thetotal MRE physical guarantee, the hydro generators may need to purch
ase energy in the short-term market to fulfill their contract obligations. Whentotal hydro generation is higher than the total MRE physic
al guarantee, the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they are ableto make extra revenue selling the excess energy on the spot market. The consequ
ences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) thermal plants moreexpensive to the system being dispatched, (ii) lower hydro
power generation with deficits in the MRE and (iii) high spot prices. ANEEL defines thespot price cap for electricity in the Brazilian market. The spot price caps as defined by AN
EEL and average spot prices by calendar year are asfollows (R$/MWh):
Year
  2017  2016  2015  2014 Spot price cap as defined by ANEEL
  534  423  388  822 Average spot rate
     94  287  689 33

Key Financial Drivers — As the system is highly dependent on hydroelectric ge neration, Tietê and Uruguaiana are are affected by thehydrology in the overall sector. They are also affected by the avail
ability of Tietê's plants and reliability of the Uruguaiana facility. The availability ofgas is also a driver for continued operations at Urugua
iana. Tietê's financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limitedto:
•
Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in MRE•
Demand growth•
Re-contracting price•
Asset management and plant availability•
Cost management•

El Salvador
Business Description 
— AES is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies operating i n El Salvador. The distributioncompanies are operated by AES on an inte
grated basis under a single management team. AES El Salvador's territory covers 77% of the country.AES El Salvador accounted for 4,151 GWh of market energy purchases duri
ng 2016, or about 63% market share of the country's total energypurchases.
MCAC Generation
Dominican Republic
Business Description 
— AES Dominicana consists of three operating subs idiaries, Itabo, Andres and DPP. AES has 24% of the systemcapacity of 850 MW and supplies approximately 37% of en
ergy demand through these generation facilities. AES has a strategic partnership with theEstrella and Linda Groups ("Estrella-Linda"), an investor grou
p based in the Dominican Republic. Estrella-Linda is a consortium of two leadingDominican industrial groups: Estrella a
nd Grupo Linda. The two partners manage a diversified business portfolio, including construction services,cement, agribusiness, metalwork, plastics, textiles, paints, transportation, insurance an
d media.Itabo is 45% owned by AES, 5% by Estrella-Linda, 49.9
7% owned by FONPER, a government-owned utility and the remaining 0.03% is ownedby employees. Itabo owns and operates two thermal power ge
neration units with a total of 295 MW of installed capacity. Itabo's PPAs withgovernment-owned distribution compan
ies expired in July 2016 and thus two new short term contracts with Ede Sur and Ede Este were signed untilnew long term contracts take place. The Dominican Corporatio
n of State Electrical Companies is sponsoring a bidding process, released in35

August 2016, which is expected to be awarded in April 2017 in order to secure supply and competitive pricing for actual and future distributionenergy requirements. The existing business strategy is to secure betwe
en 80% and 85% of the open position through new PPAs with distributioncompanies and large users. Price and PPA structure wil
l be subject to the terms of the bidding process.Andres and DPP are owned 90% by AE
S and 10% by Estrella-Linda. Andres has a combined cycle gas turbine and generation capacity of 319MW as well as the only LNG import facility in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters of storage capacity. DPP (Los Mina) has two op
en cycle naturalgas turbines and generation capac
ity of 236 MW. Both Andres and DPP have in aggregate 555 MW of installed capacity, of which 450 MW is mostlycontracted until 2018 with government-owne
d distribution companies and large customers.AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchase co
ntract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. TheLNG contract terms allow the diversion of the cargoes to various markets in Latin America. These plants cap
italize on the competitively-priced LNGcontract by selling power where the market is dominated by fuel oi
l-based generation. Andres has a long-term contract to sell re-gasified LNG toindustrial users within the Dominican R
epublic using compression technology to transport it within the country thereby capturing demand fromindustrial and commercial customers.
Market Structure - Electricity and Natural Gas 
— The Dominican Republic has o ne main interconnected system with approximately 3,553 MWof installed capacity, composed primarily of thermal generatio
n (80%), hydroelectric power plants (17%) and wind plants (3%).Regulatory Framework 
— The regulatory framework in the Dominican Republ ic consists of a decentralized industry including generation,transmission and distribution, where generati
on companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services and acompetitive wholesale generati
on market. All electric companies (generators, transmission and distributors), are subject to and regulated by theGeneral Electricity Law.
Two main agencies are responsibl
e for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the National Energy Commissionand the Superintendence of Electricity. The Nati
onal Energy Commission is in charge of drafting and coordinating the legal framework andregulatory legislation, proposin
g and adopting policies and procedures to assure best practices, drafting plans to ensure the proper functioning anddevelopment of the energy sector and promoting investment. The Sup
erintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring andsupervising compliance with le
gal provisions and rules, monitoring compliance with the technical procedures governing generation, transmission,distribution and commercialization of electricity an
d supervising electric market behavior in order to avoid monopolistic practices.The electricity tariff applicable to regulated customers is subject to regul
ation within the concessions of the distribution companies. Clients withdemand above 1 MW are classified as unregulate
d customers and their tariffs are unregulated.Fuels and hydrocarbons are regulated by a sp
ecific law which establishes prices to end customers and a tax on consumption of fossil fuels.For natural gas there are regulations related to the procedures to be foll
owed to grant licenses and concessions: i) distribution, including loading,transportation and compression plants; ii) the installati
on and operation of natural gas stations, including consumers and potential modifications ofexisting facilities; and iii) conversion e
quipment suppliers for vehicles. The regulation is administered by the Industrial and Commerce Ministry whosupervises commercial and industrial activities i
n the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to the end users.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to:•
Changes in spot prices due to fluctuations in commodity prices, (since fuel is a pass-through cost under the PPAs, any variation in oil priceswill impact the spot sales for both Andres and Itabo)
•
Contracting levels and the extent of capacity awarded•
Supply shortages in the near term (next two to three years) may provide opportunities for short term upside, but new generation is expected tocome online beginning 2018
•
Additional sales derived from domestic natural gas demand are expected to continue providing income and growth based on the entry offuture projects and the fees from the infrastructure service.
In addition, the financial weakness of the three state-own
ed distribution companies due to low collection rates and high levels of non-technicallosses has led to delays in payments for the electricity suppli
ed by generators. At times when outstanding receivable balances have accumulated,AES Dominicana has accepted p
ayment through other means, such as government bonds, in order to reduce the balance. There can be noguarantee that alternative collection method
ologies will always be an avenue available for payment options.36

Construction and Development — DPP is converting its existing plant from open cycle to combined cycl e. The project will recycle DPP's heatemissions and increase total power output by ap
proximately 114 MW of gross capacity at an estimated cost of $260 million, fully financed with non-recourse debt. The EPC contract was signed on July 2, 2014, an
d the additional capacity is expected to become operational in the first half of 2017.Based on the increased capacity, AES Domi
nicana executed a PPA for 270 MW for a 6.5 year term beginning in 2017.Panama
Business Description 
— AES owns and operates five hydroelectric pla nts and one thermoelectric power plant, Estrella del Mar I, whichcommenced operations in March 2015, representing 7
05 MW and 72 MW of hydro and thermal capacity respectively, for a total of 777 MWequivalent to 23% of the installed capac
ity in Panama. The majority of hydro sources in Panama are based on run-of-river technology, with theexception of the 260 MW Bayano plant.
A portion of the PPAs with distribution companies w
ill expire in December 2018 reducing the total contracted capacity of the company from 496MW to 430 MW. Another portion contracted through Estrella del Mar I will expire in June 2020, reduc
ing the total contracted capacity to 350 MWuntil December 2030.
Market Structure 
— Panama's current total installed capacity is 3,350 MW, of which 52% is hydroe lectric, 8% wind, 2% solar and the remaining38% thermal generation from diesel, bunker fuel and coa
l.The Panamanian power sector is composed of three disti
nct operating business units: generation, distribution and transmission, all of whichare governed by Electric Law 6 enacted in 19
97.Generators can enter into long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated cons
umers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supplycontracts with each other. Outside of the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market.
The National Dispatch Center impleme
nts the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The National Dispatch Center'sobjectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintai
n the reliability and security of the electric power system, taking into account theprice of water, which determines the dispatch of hydro plants with reservoirs. Short-term power prices are determined o
n an hourly basis by the lastdispatched generating unit.
In Panama, dry hydrological conditions remai
ned until June 2016, due to the presence of the El Niño phenomenon, affecting the generationoutput from hydroelectric facilities compared to the prior year. AES Panama had to purchas
e energy on the spot market to fulfill its contractobligations as its generation outp
ut was below contract levels. The drop in the commodities prices helped to reduce the replacement cost and thefinancial impact of spot purchases compared to the prior year. Despite the hydrol
ogy conditions, spot prices were down to $60/MWh from $91/MWhin 2015, limiting the amount recognized throu
gh the 2014-2016 Government Compensation Agreement to $1 million out of the possible $30 millionfor 2016. On March 31, 2014, the government of Panama agreed to reduce the financia
l impact of spot electricity purchases and transmissionconstraints equivalent to a 70 MW reduction in contracted capacity for the period 2
014-2016 by compensating AES Panama for spot purchasesabove the contracted price of $82.45/MWh, up to $40 million in 20
14, $30 million in 2015 and $30 million in 2016.Regulatory Framework 
— The SNE has the responsibilities of pla nning, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector withinPanama. With these responsibilities, the SNE prop
oses laws and regulations to the executive agencies that promote the procurement of electricalenergy, hydrocarbons and alternative energy for the country.
The regulator of public services, known as the ASEP, is an a
utonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the control andoversight of public services includin
g electricity and the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities and the companies that provide suchservices.
Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity. Physical generation of energy is determine
d by the National Dispatch Center regardlessof contractual arrangements.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to:•
In the event of low hydrology, high commodity prices will increase the business exposure and the cost of replacement power to fulfill ourcontractual commitments, partially mitigated by additional ge
neration from Estrella del Mar I.•
Fluctuations in commodity prices, mainly oil prices, affect the thermal generation cost impacting the spot prices and the opportunity cost ofwater.
37

•Constraints imposed by the capacity of the transmission line connecting the west side of the country with the load center are expected tocontinue until the end of 2017 keep
ing surplus power trapped, particularly during the wet season.•
Country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term.Given that most of AES' portfolio is run-of-river, hydrological conditions hav
e an important influence on its profitability. Variations in actualhydrology can result in excess or a short energy balance rel
ative to our contract obligations. During the low inflow period of January through May,generation tends to be lower and AES P
anama may purchase energy in the short-term market to cover contractual obligations. During theremainder of the year (June to December), generation tends to be higher and e
nergy generated in excess of contract volumes is sold to the short-term market. In addition to hydrological conditions, commodity prices affect short-term electricity prices.
Construction and Development 
— Continuing with the strategy to reduce reliance on hy drology started with the acquisition of the power barge,Estrella del Mar I, in August 2015 AES executed a partnershi
p agreement with Deeplight Corporation, a minority partner, with the purpose toconstruct, operate and maintain a natural gas power gen
eration plant and a liquefied natural gas terminal, in order to purchase and sell energy andcapacity as well as commercialize natural gas an
d other ancillary activities related to natural gas. As of December 31, 2016, amounts capitalizedinclude $254 million record
ed in Construction in Progress and the project is scheduled to initiate operations in the first half of 2018.Mexico
Business Description 
— AES has 1,055 MW of installed capacity in Mexico, includ ing the 550 MW Termoeléctrica del Golfo ("TEG") andTermoeléctrica Peñoles ("TEP") facilities and Merida III ("Merida"), a 505 MW generation facility.
The TEG and TEP pet coke-fired plants, located in San Lu
is Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 witha 90% availability guarantee. TEG and TE
P secure their fuel under a long-term contract.Merida is a CCGT, located in Merida, on Mexico's Yucatan Pen
insula. Merida sells power to the Federal Commission of Electricity ("CFE")under a capacity and energy based lo
ng-term PPA through 2025. Additionally, the plant purchases natural gas and diesel fuel under a long-termcontract, the cost of which is then passed through to CFE under the terms of the PPA.
In line with AES' strategy of building strategic partnersh
ips, on January 18, 2016 the 50/50 joint venture partnership agreement with Grupo BALwas fully executed. The joint venture will co-inv
est in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico.Market Structure 
— Mexico has a single national electricity grid, the Nati onal Power System, covering nearly all of Mexico's territory. Mexicohas an installed capacity totaling 6
8 GW with a generation mix of 72% thermal, 18% hydroelectric and 10% other. Electricity consumption is splitbetween the following end us
ers: industrial of 58%, residential of 26% and commercial and service of 16%.Regulatory Framework 
— Following the constitutional changes approved in December 2013, during 2014 and 2015 the Mexican governmentissued a package of secondary regulati
ons, including the Electricity Law, and operational dispositions, with the objective to start the implementationof a new regulatory framework with the following characteristics:
•
The energy market liberalization in January 2016 through the implementation of: wholesale electricity market (day ahead and real time market),ancillary services, capacity, Clean Energy Certificates, an
d Financial Transmission Rights market.•
CFE's, former state-owned electric monopoly, vertical and horizontal disintegration into different segments of the value chain: generation,transmission, distribution and commercialization.
•
CENACE as new ISO is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity market, transmission and distribution infrastructure, planning thenetwork developments, guaranteeing o
pen access to network infrastructure, executing competitive mechanisms to cover regulated demand, andsetting transmission charges.
•
Implementation of annual mid and long term auctions to secure supply for the regulated demand, establishing a PPA with CFE as the BasicSupplier.
According to the new regulatory framework, new assets develop
ed under the new framework or assets transferred to the new regime and inoperation after the approval of the Electricity Law (August 2014) are el
igible to participate in the new markets. Additionally, projects developed andoperated under the Electric Public Service L
aw38

(self-supply framework) like TEG/TEP, could choose to participate. Until the new framework is further analyzed, AES will continue operating underthe same conditions. Merida III and TEG/TEP will continue provid
ing power under long-term contracts and selling any excess or surplus energyproduced to CFE.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to:•
Operational performance (as the companies are fully contracted and better performance provides additional financial benefits includingperformance incentives and/or excess energy sales (in the case of TEG/TEP).
•
The energy prices of TEG/TEP for the sales in excess over its long-term contracts are driven by the average production cost of CFE which ishighly dependent on natural
 gas and oil.•
If the average production cost of CFE is higher than the cost of generating with pet coke, our businesses in Mexico will benefit provided that theyare able to sell energy in excess of their PPAs.
Puerto Rico
Business Description 
— AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a coal-fired co generation plant and a solar plant of 524 MW and 24 MW,respectively, representing approximately 9% of the install
ed capacity in Puerto Rico. Both plants have long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 and 2032,respectively, with PREPA, a state-owned entity that suppli
es virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits anddistributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. See Item 7.— 
Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic a nd Political—Puerto Rico for further discussion of the long-term PPA with PREPA.
El Salvador
Business Description 
— AES El Salvador also owns AES N ejapa, a 6 MW power plant generating electricity with methane gas from a landfill,fully contracted with CAESS. During 2015, AE
S El Salvador began operations of a AES Moncagua, a 2.5 MW solar facility located in the East of thecountry, which is fully contracted with EEO.
The sector is governed by the General Electricity Law and the ge
neral and specific orders are issued by Superintendencia General deElectricidad y Telecomunicacio
ns ("SIGET"). SIGET, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, completed the tariff reset process inDecember 2012 and defined the tariff calculati
on to be applicable for the five year period 2013-2017.Europe SBU

Bulgaria
Business Description 
— Our Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel plant that was commissioned in June 20 11. Maritza is fully compliant withthe European Union Industrial Emissi
on Directive, which became effective in January 2016. Maritza's entire power output is contracted with NEKunder a 15-year PPA, capacity and energy base
d, with a fuel pass-though, expiring in 2026. The lignite and limestone are supplied under 15-yearfuel supply contracts.
AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Niko
la wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. St. Nikola was commissioned in March2010. Its entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA ex
piring in March 2025.Market Structure 
— The maximum market capacity in 2016 was approximately 13 GW. Thermal generation, which is mostly coal-fired, and nuclear power plants account for 61% of the installed ca
pacity.Regulatory Framework 
— The electricity sector in Bulgaria operates under the Energy Act of 200 4 which allows the sale of electricity to takeplace freely at negotiated prices, at regulated prices betw
een parties or on the organized market. In 2016 the government of Bulgaria madeadvances toward market liberalization an
d has engaged with the World Bank to develop a model for a fully liberalized electricity market in Bulgaria.The final report with recommendations from the World Bank was finalized i
n December 2016. The Independent Bulgarian Energy Exchange (IBEX)started commercial operation of the power exchange in Jan
uary 2016 with the introduction of Day Ahead market platform. In September 2016 , IBEXexpanded its trading platform for bilateral forward contracts. The next step of the development of IBEX is the introd
uction of intra-day trading, whichis expected in mid-2017.
Our investments in Bulgaria rely on long-term PPAs with NEK, the state-owne
d electricity public supplier and energy trading company. NEKhad been facing some liquid
ity issues and had been delayed in making payments under the PPAs with Maritza and St. Nikola. In August 2015, theninth amendment of Maritza's PPA was executed, under whic
h Maritza and NEK agreed to reduce the capacity payment to Maritza by 14% throughthe PPA term without impacting the energy price component. In exchang
e, NEK paid Maritza its overdue receivables. The amendment becameeffective in April 2016 upon full payment of the overdu
e receivables by NEK. Maritza has experienced timely collection of outstanding receivablesfrom NEK since May 2016.
The Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commissio
n (“DG Comp”) continues to review NEK’s respective PPAs with Maritzaand an unrelated generator pursuant to the Europ
ean Commission’s state aid rules. Although no formal investigation has been launched by DGComp, Maritza has met with the DG Comp case team and representatives of Bulgaria to discuss the agency
’s review. Maritza expects that theparties will engage in
40

further discussions on the issues surrounding the review. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of such discussions, nor can we predict howDG Comp might resolve its review if the anticipated discussions fai
l to result in an agreement concerning the review. Maritza believes that its PPA islegal and in compliance w
ith all applicable laws, and it will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreementor otherwise. However, there can be no assurances that this matter will be resolved favora
bly; if it is not, there could be a material adverse impacton Maritza’s and the Company’s respective financi
al statements.In 2015, a number of measures were introduced to the regulation of the energy sector that sign
ificantly improved the liquidity of NEK. As aresult, NEK is forecast to end the year 2016 with a $7 million net profit, more than a $102 mill
ion improvement over year 2015 and more than a $316million improvement over year 2014 
.  However, the financial situation of NEK remains subject to political conditions and regulatory changes inBulgaria.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Both businesses, Maritza and St. Nikola, operate under PPA contracts. For the duration of the PPA, the financialresults are primarily driven by, but not limited to:
•
the availability of the operating units•
the level of wind resource for St. Nikola•
NEK's ability to meet the terms of the PPA contractUnited Kingdom
Business Description 
— AES' generation businesses i n the United Kingdom are located in Northern Ireland and operate in the Irish SEM(1,726 MW). The Northern Ireland generation facilities consist of two plants withi
n the Greater Belfast region. Our Kilroot plant is a 701 MW coal-fired plant with an additional 10 MW of energy storage facil
ity and our Ballylumford plant is a 1,015 MW gas-fired plant. These plants provideapproximately 62% of the Northern Ireland installed ca
pacity and 16% of the combined installed capacity for the island of Ireland.Kilroot is a merchant plant that bids into the SEM. the plant earns margin when sch
eduled in merit, out of merit, for capacity payments, and forancillary services. Out of merit dispatch, through which costs are recovered, occurs when there are system constraints related to wind g
eneration,voltage and transmission.
Ballylumford is partially contracted for 600 MW under a PPA with PPB that exp
ires in 2023 with the remaining capacity bid into the SEMmarket. 310 MW of this merchant capacity has a supplemental Local Reserve Services Agre
ement ("LRSA") with the system operator. Ballylumfordearns margin from availability payments received und
er the PPA, capacity payments offered through the SEM and revenues from the LRSA.Additionally, Ballylumford receiv
es margin from out of merit dispatch through which the costs of operation are recovered as well as ancillaryservices.
Market Structure 
— The majority of the generation capacity in the SEM is represented by gas-fired po wer plants, which results in marketsensitivity to gas prices. Wind generation capacity represents ap
proximately 25% of the total generation capacity. The governments of NorthernIreland and the Republic of Ireland pl
an further increases in renewable energy sources. Market availability and liquidity of hedging products areweak, reflecting the limited size and immaturity of the market, the predominance of vertical integration a
nd lack of forward pricing. There areessentially three products (baseload, mid-merit and peak
ing) which are traded between the generators and suppliers.Regulatory Framework 
— The SEM is an energy market established in 2007 an d is based on a gross mandatory pool within which allgenerators with a capacity higher than 10 MW must trade the physical deliv
ery of power. Generators are centrally dispatched based on merit orderand physical constraints of the system. The SEM structure is under review by the regulatory authorities with a n
ew structure due to be introduced inthe second quarter of 2018.
In addition, there is a capacity payment mechanism to ensure that sufficient generati
ng capacity is offered to the market. The capacity paymentis derived from a regulated Euro-based capacity payment po
ol, established a year ahead by the regulatory authority. Capacity payments are basedon the declared availabil
ity of a unit and have a degree of volatility to reflect seasonal influences, demand and the actual out-turn of generationdeclared available over ea
ch trading period.Environmental Regulation 
— In 2011, the European Commission adopted the Ind ustrial Emission Directive ("IED") that establishes theEmission Limit Values ("ELV") for SO 
2 , NO x and dust emissions effective January 1, 2016. Both Ballylumford and Kilroot are required to complywith the IED. The Ballylumford C Station is compliant witho
ut the need for investment. Both Ballylumford B Station and Kilroot required investment tobe in compliance.
41

The IED provides for two options that may be implemented by the European Union member states other than compliance with the new ELV'sthe Transitional National Pla
n or Limited Life Time Derogation.Kilroot has opted into the Transitional Nati
onal Plan which allows the plant to operate between 2016-2020, being exempt from compliance withELVs, but observing a ceiling set for maximum annual emissi
ons that is based on the last 10 years average emissions and operating hours. Kilroothas invested approximately $10 milli
on in Umbrella Selective Non Catalytic Reduction technology, which reduces the plant's NO x emissionsenabling the plant to increase its capac
ity factor within the ceiling of NO x emissions and earn energy margin. The Transitional National Plan alsoestablished a UK wide NO 
x trading scheme which Kilroot avails of as required. Further technical modifications are being evaluated which couldmake the plant fully compliant with the IED from 2020.
Without investment, the Ballylumford B station of 540 MW did not meet the standards of the IED. In 2014, AES secured a LRSA w
ith theTransmission System Operator ("TSO") to refurbish two of the three units to be compliant with ELVs under IED, providing at least 250 MW of
capacity from 2016 to 2018 with an option to extend to 2020 by the TSO. The proj
ect was executed in 2015 with an achieved combined gross outputof 310 MW.
Key Financial Drivers 
— For our businesses in the SEM market, the financial results will be driven by, but not limite d to, the following:•
Regulatory changes to the market structure and payment mechanism•
Availability of the operating units•
Commodity prices (gas, coal and CO 2 ) and sufficient market liquidity to hedge prices in the short-term•
Electricity demand in the SEM (including impact of wind generation)Kazakhstan
Business Description 
— Our businesses account for approximately 6% of the total annual gen eration in Kazakhstan. Of the total capacity of2,776 MW, 1,033 MW is hydroelectric and operates under a concession agre
ement until the beginning of October 2017 and 1,743 MW is coal-firedcapacity which is owned outright. The thermal pla
nts are designed to produce heat with electricity as a co- or by-product.The Kazakhstan businesses act as merchant plants for electricity sales by e
ntering into bilateral contracts directly with consumers for periodsof generally no more than one year. There are limited opportun
ities for the plants to be in contracted status, as there is no central offtaker, and thefew businesses that could take a whole pl
ant's generation tend to have in-house generation capacity.The hydroelectric plants are run-of-river and rely on river flow and precipitati
on, particularly snow. Due to the presence of a large multi-yearstorage dam upstream and a season minimum river flow rate agreement with Russia do
wnstream, the plants are protected against significantdownside risk to their volume in years with low precip
itation. AES does not control water flow which impacts our generation.Ust Kamenogorsk CHP provides heat to the city of Ust Kamenogorsk through the city heat netw
ork company (Ust Kamenogorsk Heat Nets).Ust Kamenogorsk CHP is their only source of supply.
Market Structure 
— The Kazakhstan electricity market totals approximately 21,307 MW, of which 17,504 MW is availa ble. The bulk of thegenerating capacity in Kazakhstan is thermal w
ith coal as the main fuel. As coal is abundantly available in Kazakhstan, most plants are designed toburn local coal. The geographic
al remoteness of Kazakhstan, in combination with its abundant resources, results in coal prices that are not reflectiveof world coal prices, current delivered cost is less than $12 per metric ton. In addition, the governme
nt closely monitors coal prices, due to theirimpact on the price of socially necessary heating an
d on electricity tariffs.Regulatory Framework 
— All Kazakhstan generating compan ies sell electricity at or below their respective tariff-cap level. These tariff-caplevels have been fixed by the Kazakhsta
n government for the period 2009-2018 for each of the fifteen groups of generators. These groups weredetermined by the Ministry of Energy, based on a number of factors including pl
ant type and fuel used.In July 2012, Kazakhstan enacted an amendme
nt to its Electricity Law requiring electricity producers to reinvest all profits generated during theyears 2013-2015 as part of annual investment obl
igation agreements, thereby limiting the businesses ability to distribute dividends. Theseinvestment obligation agreements had to be e
qual to the sum of the planned annual depreciation and profit. Selection of investment projects was atthe discretion of electricity producers, but the Ministry of Energy had the right to reject submitted proposals. An electricity prod
ucer without aninvestment obligation agreement execute
d by the Ministry of Energy was not allowed to charge tariffs exceeding its incremental cost of production,excluding depreciation.
42

In November 2015, Kazakhstan enacted amendments to its Electricity Law to eliminate the obligation for power plants to sign annualinvestment obligation agreements for 2016-20
18, thereby allowing the businesses to distribute dividends. In addition, the amendment stated that acentrally organized capacity market will be estab
lished by 2019 and that the Kazakhstan government plans to prolong price cap regulation by fixingnew caps on energy and capacity tariffs for each group of power pla
nts.Kazakhstan government has approved a rene
wable energy law which set feed-in tariffs for renewable energy and set a renewable energytarget of 3% by 2020 and 10% by 2030. This renewabl
e energy law imposes an obligation on all non-renewable power plants to purchase renewableenergy at the renewable energy tariff and resell it to customers at their own, lower price cap lev
el.Heat production in Kazakhstan is also reg
ulated as a natural monopoly. The heat tariffs are set on a cost-plus basis by making an application tothe Committee of Natural Monopoly Regulation a
nd Competition Protection, the regulator. Currently, tariffs are only for multi-year periods, but withsome annual adjustments for fuel cost.
Key Financial Drivers 
— The financial results for assets in Kazakhstan are driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to:•
Availability of the operating units;•
Regulated electricity tariff-cap levels and heat tariff levels•
Weather conditions,•
Regulatory changes to the market structure and payment mechanism•
Cost of coal and Kazakhstan currency exchange rate fluctuation.Jordan

Business Description 
— OPGC is a 420 MW coal-fired generation facility located in the state of Odisha. OPGC has a 30-year PPA with GRIDCO Limited, a state utility, expiring in 2026. The PPA is composed of a cap
acity payment based on fixed parameters and a variablecomponent, including a pass-through of actua
l fuel costs. OPGC is an unconsolidated entity and results are reported as Net Equity in Earnings of Affiliates 
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Environmental Regulation 
— The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India has rece ntly amended the Environment(Protection) Rules with stricter emission limits for new and existing thermal power pl
ants via their notification issued in December 2015. All existingplants installed before December 31, 200
3 are required to meet revised emission limits within two years and any new thermal power plants that willbe operational from January 1, 2017 are required to operate w
ith the revised emission limits. An FGD system needs to be installed in the existingunits of OPGC for complying with SO 
2 emissions requirements. The business has evaluated the options and the cost implications for the operatingplant including desig
n modification and schedule implications for the expansion project. The larger impact of these amendments and requirements ofsubstantial investments to meet the revised environmental gui
delines across the power sector in India, borne by the public and private powergeneration companies, is still under revie
w. We believe the cost of complying with the new environmental regulations will be a pass-through in theGRIDCO tariff for both existing and expansion units. Ministry of Power has issued a revised Tariff Pol
icy in January 2016 to bring more regulatorycertainty, attract private investment, ensure distribution efficiency and promote renewabl
e energy.Construction and Development 
— As noted above, AES has one coal-fired project un der development with a total capacity of 1,320 MW whichis an expansion of our existing OPGC business. The pro
ject started construction in April 2014 and is currently expected to begin operations in thesecond half of 2018. As of December 31, 
2016 , total capitalized costs at the project level were $598 milli on (the Company's share is $293 million aspart of our investment in subsidiary). In addition, AES has capitaliz
ed $18 million in construction management costs which are not attributable to thepartner. Currently, 50% of the expansion capacity is contracted with the state offtaker, GRIDCO, for a period of 25 years, with a normative after-tax
rate of return of 15.5% with an opportunity to capture additional 0.5% tied to timely completio
n of the project. The rest of the 50% of the generationcapacity is proposed to be offered to GRIDCO under a fresh regulated PPA du
e to restrictions on power sale under new guidelines.In August 2014, the Supreme Court of India invalidate
d the allocation of captive coal blocks. The government of India has subsequentlyenacted new laws allowi
ng coal block allocation to companies with limited levels of private ownership, based on which the coal blocks have beenallocated to a subsidiary of OPGC, Odisha Coal and P
ower Ltd., which is an OPGC joint venture with another company wholly-owned by thegovernment of Odisha. This new company meets the lower private ownersh
ip stipulations for allocation of mines.44

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to:•
Operating performance of the facility•
Regulatory and environmental policy changesPhilippines
Business Description 
— The Masinloc power project in the Philip pines is a 630 MW gross coal-fired plant located in Zambales, Philippines andis interconnected to the Luzon Grid, and is owned 51% by A
ES. More than 95% of Masinloc's current peak capacity is contracted through medium tolong-term bilateral contracts primarily with Meralco, the largest distribution company i
n the Philippines, several electric cooperatives and industrialcustomers.
In January 2013, Masinloc entered into a new PS
A with its main customer, Meralco, as the previous PSA expired in December 2012. The PSAis for seven years and included an additi
onal three-year extension option, which the parties agreed to exercise in March 2016. Payments areprimarily capacity-based. The PSA is primarily priced in U.S. do
llars, aligning the revenues with the majority of variable and fixed costs (fuel, debt,insurance) and minimizing currency exchan
ge risks. Masinloc's remaining contracts on the existing units expire between 2017 and 2026.Market Structure 
— The Philippine power market is divid ed into three grids representing the country's three major island groups — Luzon,Visayas and Mindanao. Luzon, wh
ich includes Manila and is the country's largest island, has limited interconnection with Visayas and represents85% of the total demand of both regions. Luzon and Visay
as together have an installed capacity of 17,294 MW.There is diversity in the mix of the Luzon — Visayas generation. For Luzon, coa
l accounts for 49% of generation, followed by natural gas at32%, and the remaining 19% is comprised by oil, geoth
ermal, and renewable resources (i.e. hydro, solar, and wind, with the latter two having prioritydispatch with feed-in tariff). For Visayas, geothermal is the top energy source and accou
nts for 47% of generation followed by coal at 39%, and theremaining 14% comprised by oil, geothermal, and ren
ewable resources.The primary customers for electricity are private distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and larg
e contestable (industrial and commercial)customers. Over 90% of the system's total energy requirement is currently being sold/purchased through medi
um (three to five years) to long (six toten years) term bilateral contracts. The remaining energy is sold through the Wholesa
le Electricity Spot Market ("WESM"), which is the real-time,bid-based and hourly market for energy where the sellers an
d the buyers adjust their differences between their production/demand and theircontractual commitments.
Regulatory Framework 
— The Philippines has divi ded its power sector into generation, transmission, distribution and supply under the ElectricPower Industry Reform Act of 2001. This Act primarily aims to increase private sector participation in the power sector and to privatiz
e the Philippinegovernment's generation and transmission ass
ets. Generation and supply are open and competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution areregulated sectors. Sale of power is conducted primarily throug
h medium or long-term bilateral contracts between generation companies anddistribution utilities specifying the vol
ume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity, which are approved by the ERC. Power is tradedin the WESM which operates under a gross pool, central disp
atch and net settlement protocols. Parties to bilateral contracts settle their transactionsoutside of the WESM and distribution companies or electricity coo
peratives buy their imbalance (i.e., power requirements not covered by bilateralcontracts) from the WESM. Distribution utilities and electric cooperatives are allowe
d to pass on to their end-users the bilateral contract rates,including WESM purchases, approved by the E
RC.Other Regulatory Considerations 
— Pursuant to Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001, Retail Competition & Open Access ("RCOA") commenced on June 26, 2013, under which retai
l electricity suppliers, who are duly licensed by the ERC, may supply directly to contestablecustomers (end-users with an average demand of at least 1 MW), with distribution companies or electricity coo
peratives providing non-discriminatory wire services. In order to ensure implementation of RCOA and stimulate transitio
n of contestable customers, ERC issued rulesimplementing mandatory contestability. Under the sai
d rules, all contestable customers are mandated to enter into power supply contracts with retailelectricity suppliers by February 2017 instead of purch
asing power from their local distribution utility.Masinloc has obtained a retail electricity sup
plier license from the ERC and currently markets power to contestable customers. UnlikeMasinloc’s contracts with distribution utilities, its contract with contestabl
e customers do not require ERC approval to be implemented.Environmental Regulation 
— To promote renewable energy, the Philipp ine government enacted the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 whichprovides incentives for the development, utilizati
on and commercialization of45

renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energies. In addition, the government also adopted a feed-in tariffscheme which was detailed und
er ERC Res No.16 s. 2010, where an eligible producer of renewable energy is entitled to a guaranteed payment of afixed rate feed-in tariff for each kilowatt-hour of energy it supplies to the grid. The feed-in tariff to be approved shal
l be specific for each emergingrenewable energy technolo
gy and shall be extended on a first-to-build basis as there is an established cap per technology on eligibility under thefeed-in tariff scheme.
Other Environmental Regulation 
— Over the past year, the government of the Philippines has sought to reduce its environmental impact,including the country’s carbon footprint. As such, the Department of Environme
nt and Natural Resources is promoting stricter environmentalcompliance, particularly on the effluent discharg
e standards. The new effluent standards issued in May 2016 have restricted discharge temperaturelimit compared to previous standards. It is yet uncertain if the new standards will be ap
plicable to the projects under construction which receivedenvironmental clearance before the new stan
dards were issued.Construction and Development 
— AES started construction on a 335 MW gross Masinloc expansion proj ect in March 2016. The totalcapitalized cost at December 31, 2016 is $133 mil
lion. An engineering, procurement and construction contract was entered into with POSCOEngineering and Constructio
n of Korea and their wholly owned Philippine affiliate company, Ventanas Philippine Construction Incorporated, inDecember 2015, with full notice to proceed issue
d on March 2016. The project is expected to be commercially operating in 2019. Progress isadvancing as planned a
nd the project is expected to be completed on schedule and within budget. The additional capacity is targeted for sale todistribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and i
ndustrial and commercial customers in the Luzon and Visayas grids. Approximately 50% of thisadditional capacity has alrea
dy been contracted with an expectation to have additional capacity contracted by the date of commercial operations.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to:•
Operating performance of the facility•
Demand from contracted customers•
Whole sale electricity price in the marketVietnam
Business Description 
— The Mong Duong II power project is a 1,242 MW gross coal-fired plant located in Qua ng Ninh Province of Vietnam andwas constructed under a BOT contract (the project will be transferred to Vietnamese government after 25 years). AES-VCM Mong Duo
ng PowerCompany Limited ("the BOT Company") is a limited liability joi
nt venture owned by affiliates of AES (51%), Posco Energy Corporation (30%) andChina Investment Corporation (19%). This is the first and largest coal-fired BOT project using pu
lverized coal fired boiler technology in Vietnam. TheBOT Company has entered a PPA with EVN, the nation
al utility, and a Coal Supply Agreement with Vinacomin, a state owned entity, both with a 25year term starting from Commercial Operation Date.
Since April 22, 2015, both units of the power facility hav
e been in commercial operations, six months earlier than the committed schedule withthe Vietnamese government. The BOT Company makes availa
ble the dependable capacity and delivers electrical energy to EVN and, in return,EVN makes payments to the BOT Company.
Market Structure 
— The Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central an d South), with total installed capacity ofapproximately 41GW, an 8% increase from 2015 (38GW). The total demand in 2016 was 15
9.5 billion kWh with the highest demand of 76.7 billionkWh in the South and 66.5 billion kWh in the North.
The fuel mix in Vietnam is comprised of hydropower 35% (priority dispatch w
ith low tariff), coal 36%, gas 19%, diesel and small hydrogeneration 4%, oil 2% (dispatched durin
g emergencies or during peak demand), thermo-gas 1% and the remaining 3% imported from China andLao. The government has a plan to increase thermal pow
er capacity, primarily with coal, to reduce the dependence on hydroelectricity. According tothe Master Plan VII revised in March 2016, the total targeted installed capacity for 2020 is a
pproximately 60,000 MW, in which coal-fired power willaccount for 43%, hydropower and pumped storage hydrop
ower 30%, gas-fired thermo-power 15%, renewable energy 10%, and imported power 2%.EVN owns 57% of installed generati
on capacity followed by Petro Vietnam 11%, Vinacomin 4%, BOT projects 11% and others 17%. EVN is astate-owned company that is solely in charge of buyin
g and selling electricity all over Vietnam. The government is planning to decrease EVN'sownership and increase private sector particip
ation in the power market.46

Regulatory Framework — The electricity sector is overseen by several key government entities, includ ing the National Assembly, the PrimeMinister, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Electricity Regulatory Agency of Vietnam, which is u
nder the supervision of the Ministry ofIndustry and Trade. These entities are responsible for the issuanc
e of laws, guidance, and implementing regulations for the sector. The Ministry ofIndustry and Trade, in particular, is responsible for formulating a program to restructure the power industry, develo
p the electricity market andpromulgating electricity market regulations. The fuel supp
ly is owned by the government through Vinacomin and Petro Vietnam. The governmentplans to equitize EVN-owned g
eneration companies and separate generation, System and Market Provider and distribution into three differentindependent operations i
n order to establish the competitive power market.Other Regulatory Considerations 
— According to Decision 63/2013/QD-TTG dated Aug ust 2013, the roadmap of the power market of Vietnamconsists of three phases. The first phase established a competitive el
ectricity market and was finished at the end of 2014. The second phase: (i)period of 2015-2016 for establishment of a pilot competitiv
e wholesale electricity market; and (ii) period of 2017-2021 for implementation of acompetitive wholesale electricity market. The third phase: (i) period of 202
2-2023 for establishment of a pilot competitive retail electricity market; and(ii) from 2024 onward for implementation of competitive retail electricity market. EVN, a long standin
g monopoly in the whole chain of generation,transmission and distribution, is being restructured to allo
w spin-off of several subsidiaries into either independent state-owned enterprises or jointstock companies. The BOT power plants will not participate i
n the power market; alternatively the single buyer will bid the tariff on the power pool ontheir behalf.
Environmental Regulation 
— Mong Duong II BOT Power Plant complies strictly with environmental requ irements involving local regulationsand IFC Environmental, Health and Safety Guide
lines for thermal power plants.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors includ ing, but not limited to the operating performance of thefacility.

Financial Data by CountrySee the table with our consolidated o
perations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , and property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 
2016 and 2015 , by country, in Note 16 — Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
of this Form 10-K for further information. Environmental and Land-Use Regulations
The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numero
us environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potentialGHG legislation or regulations, and actual or pote
ntial laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal ofcoal combustion residuals), and certain air emissio
ns, such as SO 2 , NO X , PM, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks anduncertainties could result in increased ca
pital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of ourU.S. or international subsidiaries, and our cons
olidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.— Risk Factors — 
Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations; Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives fromenvironmental regulatory agencies; 
and Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concernabout greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potentia
l risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have amaterial adverse impact on our consolidated results of operati
ons, financial condition and cash flows in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws and regulations of individu
al countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K under the applicable SBUs.
Many of the countries in which the Company does busi
ness also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting,ownership, operation, modification, repair an
d decommissioning of, and power sales from, electric power generation or distribution assets. Inaddition, international projects fund
ed by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many otherinternational lenders are subject to World Bank e
nvironmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local countrystandards. The Company often has used advance
d generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as CFB boilers andadvanced gas turbines, and environme
ntal control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO 2 emissions and selective catalytic reduction forNO 
x emissions.Environmental laws and regulati
ons affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and havebecome more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will co
ntinue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with theseenvironmental laws and regulati
ons. See Item 7 .—Management's Discussion and Ana lysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Environmental Capital E
xpenditures in this Form 10-K for more detail. The Company and its subsidiaries may be require d to make significant capitalor other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can b
e no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of theCompany will be able to recover any of these compli
ance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated resultsof operations, financial condition a
nd cash flows would not be materially affected.Various licenses, permits and approvals are requ
ired for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmentallaws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expe
nditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subjectto litigation or regulatory action relating to environme
ntal permits or approvals. See Item 3. —Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and reg
ulatory action.United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations
In the U.S. the CAA and various state laws and regulations reg
ulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO 2 , NO X , PM, GHGs, mercury andother hazardous air pollutants. Certain appl
icable rules are discussed in further detail below.CSAPR — 
CSAPR addresses the "good neig hbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any airpollutant in an amount which wil
l contribute significantly to any other state’s nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. TheCSAPR requires significant reductio
ns in SO 2 and NO X emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate.Once fully implemented, the rule requires SO 
2 emission reductions of 73%, and NO X reductions of 54%, from 2005 levels. The CSAPR isimplemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compli
ance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissionsallowances created by the EPA. The CSA
PR contemplates limited interstate and unlimited intra-state trading of emissions allowances by coveredsources. Initially, the EPA issued
48

emissions allowances to affected power plants based on state emissions budgets established by the EPA under the CSAPR. The Company isrequired to comply with the CSAPR in several states, inclu
ding Ohio, Indiana, Oklahoma and Maryland. The Company complies with CSAPRthrough operation of existing controls and purch
ases of allowances on the open market, as needed. While the Company's 2015 CSAPR compliancecosts were immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allow
ances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at thistime.
The EPA issued an interim final rule establ
ishing the following deadlines for implementation of the CSAPR:•
January 1, 2015: Phase 1 (2015 and 2016) began for annual trading programs. Existing units must have begun monitoring and reporting SO 2 and NO 
x emissions.•
May 1, 2015: Phase 1 began for ozone-season NO x trading program. Existing units must have begun monitoring and reporting NO x emissions.•
December 1, 2015 (and each Dec. 1 thereafter): Date by which sources must demonstrate compliance with ozone-season NO x trading program(i.e., allowance transfer deadline).
•
March 1, 2016 (and each March 1 thereafter): Date by which sources must demonstrate compliance with annual trading programs (i.e.,allowance transfer deadline).
•
January 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for annual trading programs. Assurance provisions in effect.•
May 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for ozone-season NO x trading program. Assurance provisions in effect.On
 October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS ("CSAPR Update Rule"). TheCSAPR
 Update Rule finds that NO x ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Indiana, Maryland, Ohio and Oklahoma) affect the ability ofdownwind
 states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updatedexisting
 CSAPR NO x ozone  season  emission  budgets  for  electric  generating  units  within  these  states  and  implemented  these  budgets  throughmodifications
 to the CSAPR NO x ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation will start in the 2017 ozone season (May-September2017). Affected facilities will receive fewer ozone season NO 
x allowances in 2017 and later, resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances.At
 this time, we cannot predict what the impact will be with respect to these new standards and requirements, but it could be material if certainfacilities will need to purchase ad
ditional allowances based on reduced allocations.MATS — 
Pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA, the EPA publis hed a final rule in 2012 called the MATS establishing National EmissionsStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from coal and oil-fired e
lectric utility steam generating units. The rule required all affected power plants tocomply with the applicable MATS standards by A
pril 2015, with the possibility of obtaining a one year extension, if needed, to complete theinstallation of necessary controls. All of the Company's U.S. coa
l-fired plants operated by the Company's subsidiaries are currently in compliancewith MATS.
There currently are challenges to the EPA’s determinati
on that it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissionsfrom electric generating units - the basis for the MATS rule - proceeding in the United States Co
urt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the“D.C. Circuit”) but, in the meantime, the MATS rule remains in effect. We currently cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, or its impact, if any,
on our MATS compliance or ultimate costs.
New Source Review ("NSR") — 
The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain req uirements on major emission sources, such aselectric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a sign
ificant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, includingpower plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR req
uirements, if they meet the RMRR exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty,and significant litigation, regardi
ng which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. The EPA has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcementstrategy to address NSR compliance issues at the nation's co
al-fired power plants. The strategy has included both the filing of suits against powerplant owners and the issuance of NOVs to a number of power pla
nt owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regu
latory action, including a NOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerningNSR and prevention of significant deteri
oration issues under the CAA.In 2000, DP&L's Stuart Station received a NOV from the EPA alleg
ing that certain activities undertaken in the past are outside the scope of theRMRR exclusion. Hutchings Station als
o received such a NOV in 2009. Additionally, generation units partially owned by DP&L but operated by otherutilities have received such NOVs
49

relating to equipment repairs or replacements alleged to be outside the RMRR exclusion. The NOVs issued to DP&L-operated plants have not beenpursued through litigation by the EPA.
If NSR requirements were imposed on any of the power plants own
ed by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a materialadverse impact on the Company's business, financ
ial condition and results of operations. In connection with the imposition of any such NSRrequirements on IPL, the utility would seek recovery of any operating or cap
ital expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduceregulated air emissions, but not fines or penalties; how
ever, there can be no assurances that they would be successful in that regard.Regional Haze Rule — 
The EPA's "Regional Haze R ule" is intended to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas, and setsguidelines for determining BART at affected pl
ants and how to demonstrate "reasonable progress" towards eliminating man-made haze by 2064.The Regional Haze Rul
e required states to consider five factors when establishing BART for sources, including the availability of emission controls,the cost of the controls and the effect of reducing emission on visibility in Cl
ass I areas (including wilderness areas, national parks and similarareas). The statute requires compliance within five years after the EPA approves the rel
evant SIP or issues a federal implementation plan, althoughindividual states may impose more stringent complianc
e schedules.EPA previously determined that states include
d in the CSAPR would not be required to make source-specific BART determinations for BART-affected electric generating units, reasoning that the emissio
ns reductions required by the CSAPR were "better than BART." Concurrently, EPA alsofinalized a limited disapprova
l of certain states' plans — including Ohio's — that previously relied on the EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule to improvevisibility and substituted a Federal Implementati
on Plan that relies on the CSAPR. Environmental groups have challenged EPA's determination thanthe CSAPR is "better than BART." The challenge currently is proce
eding in the D.C. Circuit.The second phase of the Regiona
l Haze Rule begins in 2019 and states must submit regional haze plans for this second implementationperiod in 2021, to continue to demonstrate reasona
ble progress towards reducing visibility impairment in Class I areas. States may need to requireadditional emissions controls for visibi
lity impairing pollutants, including on BART sources, during the second implementation period. We currentlycannot predict the impact of this second implementation perio
d, if any, on any of our Company’s U.S. subsidiaries.National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") — 
Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal poll utants considered harmful topublic health and the environme
nt, including ozone, particulate matter, NO x and SO 2 , which result from coal combustion.  Areas meeting theNAAQS are designated "attainment areas" while thos
e that do not meet the NAAQS are considered "nonattainment areas." Each state must developa plan to bring nonattainment areas into compli
ance with the NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA isrequired to review NAAQS at five-year intervals.
Based on the current and potential future ambient standards, certain of the states in wh
ich the Company's subsidiaries operate havedetermined or will be required to determine wheth
er certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required tomodify their State Implementation Plans to detail how the states will reg
ain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that theapplicable state environmental reg
ulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to reach attainmentstatus for ozone, fine particulate matter, NO 
x or SO 2 . The compliance costs of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries could be material.On September 30, 2015, IDEM published its final rule estab
lishing reduced SO 2 limits for IPL facilities in accordance with a new one-hourstandard of 75 parts per billion, for the areas in which IPL's Hardi
ng Street, Petersburg, and Eagle Valley Generating Stations operate. Thecompliance date for these requirements was January 1, 2017. No imp
act is expected for Eagle Valley or Harding Street Generating Stationsbecause these facilities ceased coa
l combustion prior to the compliance date. It is expected that improvements to the existing FGDs at Petersburgwill be required in order to comply. IPL estimates costs for compliance at Petersburg at approximate
ly $29 million for measures that enhance theperformance and integrity of the FGDs systems. On May 31, 2016, IPL filed its SO 
2 NAAQS compliance plans with the IURC. IPL is seekingapproval for a CPCN for these measures at its Petersburg Generating Station. IPL expects to recover through its enviro
nmental rate adjustmentmechanism any operating or capital expen
ditures related to compliance with these requirements. Recovery of these costs is sought through anIndiana statute that allows for 80% recovery of qualifying costs through a rate adj
ustment mechanism, with the remainder recorded as a regulatoryasset to be considered for recovery in the next base rate case proceeding. Ho
wever, there can be no assurances that IPL will be successful in thatregard. In light of the uncertainties at this time, we cannot predict the impact of these permit requirements on our consolid
ated results of operations,cash flows, or financial condition, but it may be material.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions — 
In January 2011, the EPA began regulati ng GHG emissions from certain50

stationary sources under the so-called "Tailoring Rule." The regulations are being implemented pursuant to two CAA programs: the Title V OperatingPermit program and the program requiring a permit if undergoing certain ne
w construction or major modifications, known as the PSD. Obligationsrelating to Title V permits include record-keeping a
nd monitoring requirements. Sources subject to PSD can be required to implement BACT. In June2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had exceede
d its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule by regulating under the PSDprogram sources based solely on their GHG emissions. However, the U.S. Supreme Co
urt also held that the EPA could impose GHG BACTrequirements for sources already required to implement PSD for certain other poll
utants. Therefore, if future modifications to our U.S.-basedbusinesses' sources require PSD revie
w for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements. The EPA has issued guidance on what BACTentails for the control of GHG and has now proposed NSPS for modified a
nd reconstructed units (see below) that will serve as a floor (maximumemission rate) for future BACT requirements. Individual states are now required to determine w
hat controls are required for facilities within theirjurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. The ultimate impact of the BACT req
uirements applicable to us on our operations cannot be determined at thistime as our U.S.-based businesses will not be require
d to implement BACT until one of them constructs a new major source or makes a majormodification of an existing major source. However, the cost of compliance co
uld be material.On October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing NS
PS for new electric generating units became effective. The NSPS establish CO 2 emissions standards of 1400 lbs/MWh for newly constructed coal-fuele
d electric generating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage ofCO 
2 emissions from the plants. The NSPS for large, newly constructed NGCC facilities is 1,000 lbs/MWh. These standards apply to any electricgenerating unit with construction commencing after Janu
ary 8, 2014. The EPA also promulgated NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructedelectric generating units, which will serve as a flo
or for future BACT determinations for such units. The NSPS applicable to modified andreconstructed coal-fired units will be 1,800 lbs CO 
2 /MWh for sources with heat input greater than 2,000 MMBtu per hour. For smaller sources,below 2,000 MMBtu per hour, the standard is 2,000 lbs CO 
2 /MWh. The NSPS could have an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/ormodify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations.
On December 22, 2015, the EPA's final CO 
2 emission rules for existing power plants under Clean Air Act Section 111(d) (called the CPP) alsobecame effective. The CPP provides for interim emissions performance rates that must be achieved be
ginning in 2022 and final emissionsperformance rates that must be achieved starting in 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to meet state-wide emissi
on rate standards orequivalent mass-based standards, with the goa
l being a 32% reduction in total U.S. power sector emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The CPPrequires states to submit, by 2016, implementation plans to meet the standards or a request for an extension to 20
18. If a state fails to develop andsubmit an approvable implementation p
lan, the EPA will finalize a federal plan for that state. The full impact of the CPP will depend on the following:•
whether and how the states in which the Company's U.S. businesses operate respond to the CPP;•
whether the states adopt an emissions trading regime and, if so, which trading regime;•
how other states respond to the CPP, which will affect the size and robustness of any emissions trading market; and•
how other companies may respond in the face of increased carbon costs.Several states and industry groups challen
ged the NSPS for CO 2 in the D.C. Circuit. Oral argument on the challenges is scheduled for April2017. We cannot predict at this time the likely outcome of these challeng
es but, if the NSPS is vacated, it also likely would result in the invalidationof the CPP, as EPA’s authority to issue the CPP under Section 1
11(d) of the Clean Air Act is triggered only be EPA’s promulgation of NSPS underSection 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.
In addition, several states and industry groups filed petiti
ons in the D.C. Circuit challenging the CPP and requested a stay of the rule while thechallenge was considere
d. The D.C. Circuit denied the stay and granted requests to consider the challenges on an expedited basis. As a result, theD.C. Circuit may issue an opinion on these chal
lenges prior to the end of 2016. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders stayingimplementation of the CPP pending reso
lution of challenges to the rule. The challenges have been fully briefed and argued before the D.C. Circuitand could be decided by the court at any time. Chall
enges to the D.C. Circuit’s decision could then be filed with the Supreme Court.The Company will likely not know the a
nswers to the above questions regarding the CPP until 2018 or later. As the first compliance period willnot end until 2025, and because w
e cannot predict whether the CPP will survive the legal challenges, it is too soon to determine the CPP's potentialimpact on our business, operations or financial co
ndition, but any such impact could be material.51

Cooling Water Intake — The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governi ng water use and discharge. In particular, theCompany's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule iss
ued by the EPA that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms byrequiring existing steam electric generating faci
lities to utilize the BTA for cooling water intake structures. On August 15, 2014, the EPA published itsfinal standards to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into co
oling water systems at large power plants and other industrial facilities.These standards require subject facilities that utiliz
e at least 25% of the withdrawn water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intakeflow of greater than two million gallons per day to choos
e among seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, facilities that withdrawat least 125 million gallons per day for cool
ing purposes must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainme
nt of aquatic organisms. This decision-making process would include public input aspart of permit renewal or permit modification. It is possible this process could result in the need to insta
ll closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cyclecooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards requ
ire that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity arerequired to reduce both impingement and entrai
nment that achieves one of two alternatives under national BTA standards for entrainment. It is notyet possible to predict the total impacts of this recent final rule at this time, including any cha
llenges to such final rule and the outcome of any suchchallenges. However, if addition
al capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.AES Southland's current plan to comply with the C
alifornia State Water Resources Board's ("SWRCB") regulations will see all once-through-cooled ("OTC") generating units retired from service by December 31, 2020. New air-coole
d combined cycle gas turbine generators and batteryenergy storage systems will be constructed at the AES Alamitos and AE
S Huntington Beach generating stations and the OTC generating units atthe AES Redondo Beach ge
nerating station will be retired. The execution of the Implementation Plan for compliance with the SWRCB's OTC policyis entirely dependent on the Company
's ability to execute on long-term power purchase agreements to support project financing of the replacementgenerating units at AES Alamitos and AE
S Huntington Beach. The SWRCB is currently reviewing the Implementation Plan and latest updateinformation to evaluate the impact on electrical system reliabil
ity, which could result in the extension of OTC compliance dates for specific units.  TheCompany’s California subsid
iaries have signed 20-year term power purchase agreements with Southern California Edison for the new generatingcapacity which have been approv
ed by the California Public Utilities Commission. Approvals and permits to construct the new generating units arepending approval by the Cal
ifornia Energy Commission and South Coast Air Quality Management District. Construction is scheduled to begin inJune 2017 at AES Huntington Be
ach and July 2017 at AES Alamitos.Power plants will be required to comply with the more stringe
nt of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirementsare more stringent and have earlier compliance dates tha
n the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's Californiaassets. Challenges to the federal EPA's rule h
ave been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation ofthe rule has not been stayed while the chal
lenges proceed. The Company anticipates once-through cooling and CWA Section 316(b) complianceregulations and costs would have a materia
l impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Water Discharges — 
Certain of the Company's U.S.-based businesses are su bject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permitsthat regulate specific industrial waste water and storm water discharges to the waters of the U.S. under the CWA. On June 29, 20
15, the EPA andthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule d
efining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S.. This rule, which became effective onAugust 28, 2015, may expand or otherwise chang
e the number and types of waters or features subject to federal permitting. On October 9, 2015,the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order to temporarily stay the "Waters of the U.S." rule nationwide while that court
determines whether it has authority to hear the challenges to the rule. The ord
er was in response to challenges brought by 18 states and followed anAugust 2015 court decision in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota to stay the rule in 13 other states. We cannot predict the duratio
n of thenationwide or partial stay of the rule or the outcome of this litigation; how
ever, if the rule ultimately survives the legal challenges, it could have amaterial impact on our business, financial cond
ition or results of operations.On January 7, 2013, the Ohio Environmental Protection Age
ncy issued an NPDES permit for J.M. Stuart Station. The primary issues involvethe temperature and thermal discharges from the Station including the p
oint at which the water quality standards are applied, i.e., whether waterquality standards apply at the point where the Statio
n discharge canal discharges into the Ohio River, or whether, as the EPA alleges, the dischargecanal is an extension of Little Three Mile Creek an
d the water quality standards apply at the point where water enters the discharge canal. Inaddition, there are a number of other water-related permit requirements establishe
d with respect to metals and other materials contained in thedischarges from the Station. The NPDES permit establishes interim stand
ards related to the thermal discharge for 54 months that are comparable tocurrent levels of discharge by
52

Stuart Station. Permanent standards for both temperature and overall thermal discharges are established as of 55 months after the permit iseffective, except that an additional transitional peri
od of approximately 22 months is allowed if compliance with the permanent standards is to beachieved through a plan of construction an
d various milestones on the construction schedule are met. It is believed that compliance with the permitas written will require capital expenses that wi
ll be material to DP&L. The cost of compliance and the timing of such costs is uncertain and may varyconsiderably dependi
ng on a compliance plan that would need to be developed, the type of capital projects that may be necessary, and theuncertainties that may arise in the likely event that permits and approvals from other governmenta
l entities would likely be required to construct andoperate any such capital project. DP&L has ap
pealed various aspects of the final permit to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission,although a hearing date is not currently sched
uled. The compliance schedule in the final permit has been modified to accommodate the timing of thehearing. The outcome of such appeal is uncertai
n.On August 28, 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits to the IPL Petersburg, Harding Street an
d Eagle Valley generating stations, whichbecame effective in October 2012. NPDES permits regulate specific i
ndustrial wastewater and storm water discharges to the waters of Indianaunder Sections 402 and 405 of the U.S. Clea
n Water Act. These permits set new water quality-based effluent discharge limits for the Harding Streetand Petersburg facilities, as well as monitoring a
nd other requirements designed to protect aquatic life, with full compliance required by October2015. In April 2013, IPL received an extensio
n to the compliance deadline through September 29, 2017 for IPL's Harding Street and Petersburgfacilities through agreed orders with IDEM. IPL conducted studi
es to determine the operational changes and control equipment necessary to complywith the new limitations. In October 2014, IPL filed its wastewater complianc
e plans for its power plants with the IURC. On July 29, 2015, the IURCapproved a Certificate of Public Conven
ience and Necessity to convert Unit 7 at the Harding Street Station from coal-fired to natural gas-fired (about410 MW net capacity) at a cost of up to $71 million (the IURC later approved IPL’s updated cost estimate for the Hardin
g Street Station refuelsincluding $64 millio
n for Unit 7), and also to install and operate wastewater treatment technologies at Harding Street Station and PetersburgGenerating Station at a cost of up to $326 million. The IURC order also gra
nted IPL authority for timely rate recovery for 80% of the costs of theseprojects and authority to defer the remaining 20% as a regulatory asset to be consi
dered for recovery through IPL’s next basic rate case proceeding.However, there can be no assurances that IPL will be successfu
l in that regard.On November 3, 2015, the EPA published its final E
LG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by power plants.These effluent limitations for existing and new sources i
nclude dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash and more stringenteffluent limitations for flue gas de-sulfurization wastewater. Compl
iance time lines for existing sources will be established by the applicablepermitting authorities and will be set as soon as determin
ed possible, but no sooner than November 1, 2018 and no later than December 31, 2023.IPL plans to install a dry bottom ash handling system in respons
e to the CCR rule described below in advance of the ELG compliance date. As such,the impact of the ELG rule is not expected to be material. While we are still evaluatin
g the impacts of the final rule for DP&L, we anticipate thatimplementation of the requirements will have a material a
dverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Selenium Rule 
— NPDES permits may be updated to include Selenium water quality based effluent limits based on a site specific evaluationprocess which includes determinin
g if there is a reasonable potential to exceed the revised final Selenium water quality standards for the specificreceiving water body utilizing actua
l and/or project discharge information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict thetotal impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challen
ges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additionalcapital expenditures are necessary, they could b
e material. IPL would seek recovery of these capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee itwould be successful in this regard.
Waste Management — 
In the course of operations, the Company's facilities generate so lid and liquid waste materials requiring eventualdisposal or processing. With the exception of coal combusti
on residuals ("CCR"), the wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property,but are shipped off site for final disposal, treatment or recycling. CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air po
llution control wastes, isdisposed of at some of our coal-fired power generation pl
ant sites using engineered, permitted landfills. Waste materials generated at our electricpower and distribution facilities may incl
ude asbestos, CCR, oil, scrap metal, rubbish, small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spentsolvents, tree and land clearing wastes and P
CB contaminated liquids and solids. The Company endeavors to ensure that all of its solid and liquidwastes are disposed of in accordance with ap
plicable national, regional, state and local regulations. On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulatingCCR under the Resource Conservation a
nd Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicableminimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operatin
g landfills and surface impoundments, and may impose closure and/orcorrective action requirements for existing CCR landfills a
nd impoundments under certain specified conditions. The primary enforcementmechanisms under this
53

regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed into law the WaterInfrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIN Act), which includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program,
or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program.
The existing ash ponds at IPL's Petersburg Station d
o not meet certain structural stability requirements set forth in the CCR rule. As such, IPLwould be required to cease use of the ash pon
ds by April 17, 2017. However, IDEM has granted IPL a variance extending that deadline to April 11,2018. In order to handle the bottom ash material that would otherwise b
e sluiced to the ash ponds, IPL plans to install a dry bottom ash handlingsystem at an estimated cost of approximately $47 million. On May 31, 2016, IPL filed its CCR complia
nce plans with the IURC. IPL is seekingapproval for a CPCN to install the bottom ash dewatering system at its Petersburg gen
erating station. IPL expects to recover through itsenvironmental rate adjustment mechanism any operatin
g or capital expenditures related to the installation of this system. Recovery of these costs issought through an Indiana statute that allows for 80% recovery of qual
ifying costs through a rate adjustment mechanism with the remainderrecorded as a regulatory asset to be considered for recovery in the next base rate case procee
ding. However, there can be no assurances that IPLwill be successful in that regard. In light of the uncertainties at this time, we cannot predict the impact of these requ
irements on our consolidatedresults of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, but it may be material.
CERCLA — 
The Comprehensive Environmental R esponse, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (aka "Superfund") may be the source ofclaims against certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiari
es from time to time. There is ongoing litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfillwhere a group of companies already recogn
ized as potentially responsible parties have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking acontribution toward the costs of assessment and remediation. DP&L is activ
ely opposing such claims. In 2003, DP&L received notice that the EPAconsiders DP&L to be a potentially respo
nsible party at the Tremont City landfill Superfund site. EPA has taken no further action with respect toDP&L since 2003 regarding the Tremont City la
ndfill. The Company is unable to determine whether there will be any liability, or the size of anyliability that may ultimately be assessed agai
nst DP&L at these two sites, but any such liability could be material to DP&L.Unit Retirement and Replacement Generation — 
In the second quarter of 2013, IPL retired in place five oil-fired peaki ng units with an averagelife of approximately 61 years (approximately 168 MW net capacity in total), as such units were not eq
uipped with the advanced environmentalcontrol technologies neede
d to comply with existing and expected environmental regulations. Although these units represented approximately 5% ofIPL's generating capacity, they were seldom disp
atched by Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. in recent years due to their relativelyhigher production cost and in some instances rep
airs were needed. In addition to these recently retired units, IPL has several other generating unitsthat it expects to retire or refuel by 2017. These units are primarily coal-fired and represent 472 MW of net capacity in total. To replace this
generation, in April 2013, IPL filed a petiti
on and case-in-chief with the IURC in April 2013 seeking a CPCN to build a 550 to 725 MW CCGT at itsEagle Valley Station site in Indi
ana and to refuel Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (106 MW net capacity each). In May2014, the IURC issued an order on the CPCN auth
orizing the refueling project and granting approval to build a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at a totalbudget of $649 million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $632 mil
lion. IPL was granted authority to accrue post in-service allowance fordebt and equity funds used during constructio
n and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling project until suchtime that IPL is allowed to collect both a return and depreciatio
n expense on the CCGT and refueling project. The CCGT is expected to be placedinto service in the first half of 2018, and the refueling project was complete
d in December 2015. The costs to build and operate the CCGT and forthe refueling project, other than fuel costs, will not be recoverable by IPL throu
gh rates until the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with theIURC after the assets have been placed in service. For a discussio

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
You should consider carefully the foll
owing risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.Additional risks and uncertainties a
lso may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7.—Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Fina
ncial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, ourbusiness, financial results and financ
ial condition could be materially adversely affected.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we
presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have ide
ntified in Item 1A.— Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the following: •
risks related to our high level of indebtedness;•
risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;•
external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;•
risks associated with our operations; and•
risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.These risk factors should be read in conjunction w
ith Item 7.— Management's Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations 
, and the Consolidated Financi al Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.Risks Related to our High Level of Indebtedness
We have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the
ability to fulfill our ob
ligations.As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $20.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a co nsolidated basis. All outstandingborrowings, if any, under The AES Corporation's se
nior secured credit facility are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capitalstock of many of The AES Corporation's directly held subsid
iaries. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries is secured bysubstantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. Si
nce we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations mustbe used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are use
d to secure this debt, this reduces theamount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support and red
uces our flexibility in dealing with these secured assets. Thishigh level of indebtedness a
nd related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:•
making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;•
increasing the likelihood of a downgrade of our debt, which could cause future debt costs and/or payments to increase under our debt andrelated hedging instruments and consume a
n even greater portion of cash flow;•
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreignexchange rates and commodity prices;
•
reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;•
placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and•
limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additionalfunds as needed or take advantage of busin
ess opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.The agreements governing our indebte
dness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence ofadditional indebted
ness. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described57

above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flows may not besufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be abl
e to borrow money, sell assets,raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptabl
e terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. See Note 11 —Debt included in Item 8. of this Form 10-K for a schedule of our debt maturities.
The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its pub
licdebt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, in
terest, loans or otherwise.The AES Corporation is a holdin
g company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. All of The AES Corporation'srevenue is generated through its subsidi
aries. Accordingly, almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities ofits subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's a
bility to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent notonly on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cas
h, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees,interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.
However, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ab
ility to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. Most of the subsidiaries areobligated, pursuant to loan agreements, ind
entures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or otherconditions before they may make distributions to The AES Corp
oration. In addition, the payment of dividends or the making of loans, advances orother payments to The AES Corporation may be subject to other contractual, lega
l or regulatory restrictions or may be prohibited altogether.Business performance and local accou
nting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend.Subsidiaries in foreign countries may als
o be prevented from distributing funds to The AES Corporation as a result of foreign governments restrictingthe repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Any right that The AES Corporatio
n has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiariesupon any liquidation, diss
olution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent rightof the holders of The AES Corporation's inde
btedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, those assets) will be effectivelysubordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary's cred
itors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary).The AES Corporation's subsidi
aries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AESCorporation's indebtedness, hav
e no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any fundsavailable whether by divid
ends, fees, loans or other payments.Even though The AES Corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could
adversely affect The AES Corporation.
We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agre
ements and related documents which, except as notedbelow, require the loans to be repaid sol
ely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is securedsolely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsid
iary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred toas non-recourse debt or "non-recourse financing." In some non-recourse financ
ings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certainlimited obligations and conti
ngent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of futureevents. These obligations and li
abilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements andagreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.
As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $20.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a co nsolidated basis, of which approximately$4.7 billion 
was recourse debt of The AES Corporation and ap proximately $15.8 billion was non-recourse debt. In addition, we have outstand ingguarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this Form 10-K in Item 7.—
Management's Discussion and An
alysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Parent CompanyLiquidity 
. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstan
ding indebtedness. The total debt classified ascurrent in our Consolidated Balanc
e Sheets related to such defaults was $128 million as of December 31, 2016 . While the lenders under our non- recourse financings generally do n
ot have direct recourse to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AESCorporation), defaults thereunder can still have important cons
equences for The AES Corporation, including, without limitation:58

•reducing The AES Corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the projectsubsidiary will typically be proh
ibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default;•
under certain circumstances, triggering The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit orother credit support which The AES Corporation has prov
ided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;•
causing The AES Corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets;•
triggering defaults in The AES Corporation's outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. For example, The AES Corporation's senior securedcredit facility and outstanding senior notes inc
lude events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. Inaddition, The AES Corporation's se
nior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding materialdebt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiari
es that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary;•
the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company; or•
foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived fromthose assets.
None of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsid
iaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard ofmateriality in The AES Corporation's seni
or secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default orpermit acceleration under such indebted
ness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and othermatters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsi
diaries, individually or in theaggregate, could fall within the app
licable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event ofdefault and possible accelerati
on of the indebtedness under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of The AESCorporation.
Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital
The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.
The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund:
•
principal repayments of debt;•
interest and preferred dividends;•
acquisitions;•
construction and other project commitments;•
other equity commitments, including business development investments;•
equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;•
taxes; and•
Parent Company overhead costs.The AES Corporation's principa
l sources of liquidity are:•
dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;•
proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and•
proceeds from asset sales.For a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporati
on's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Fina
ncial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity in this Form 10-K. While we believe that these sources will b
e adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this beliefis based on a number of material assumptions, includi
ng, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commerciallending markets, the operating and financi
al performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of oursubsidiaries to pay dividends a
nd other distributions. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect, and, therefore there can be noassurance that these sources will be availa
ble when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. For example, inrecent years, certain financial institutions have gon
e bankrupt. In the event that a bank who is party to our senior secured credit facility or otherfacilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unab
le59

to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce ourliquidity. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principa
l outstanding under our credit facility and our debtsecurities and we may have to refinance such obli
gations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing onterms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.
Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on 
favorable terms.From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flo
ws.Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis a
nd the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors,some of which are beyond our control, includin
g:•
general economic and capital market conditions;•
the availability of bank credit;•
investor confidence;•
the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as wellas companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and
•
changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.Should future access to capital not be availa
ble to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improveexisting facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or fina
ncial condition.A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital
markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.
If any of the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be down
graded, our ability to raise capital on favorable termscould be impaired and our borrowin
g costs could increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporation's credit ratings and the trading pricesof its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as wi
lling to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation toprovide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and ex
isting commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide someother form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporatio
n. There can beno assurance that such counterparties will accept such g
uarantees or that AES could arrange such further assurances in the future. In addition, tothe extent The AES Corporation is required and a
ble to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount ofcredit available to The AES Corporatio
n to meet its other liquidity needs.We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund developing projects in certain 
less developed economies which could changeor in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy.
Part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing busin
esses in less developed economies where the return on our investment maybe greater than projects in more developed econ
omies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financingin certain less developed econ
omies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support orguarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bil
ateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition tomaking such project financing avail
able, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign relatedrisks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the internation
al financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will beavailable when nee
ded, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with ourinvestment objectives and would le
ave less funds for other projects.External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility
Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the
wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
Some of our businesses sell electricity in the spot markets in cases where they op
erate at levels in excess of their power sales agreements orretail load obligations. Our business
es may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising andfalling prices in those markets. The open market wholesal
e prices for electricity can be volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of fuels such ascoal, natural gas
60

or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. Consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oilderivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of el
ectricity.Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things:
•
plant availability in the markets generally;•
availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;•
competition;•
electricity usage;•
seasonality;•
foreign exchange rate fluctuation;•
availability and price of emission credits;•
hydrology and other weather conditions;•
illiquid markets;•
transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;•
availability of competitively priced renewables sources;•
increased adoption of distributed generation;•
available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal;•
generating unit performance;•
natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;•
energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;•
geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas;•
general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption; and•
bidding behavior and market bidding rules.Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due 
to fluctuations in currency exchange ratesexperienced at our foreign operations.
Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure assoc
iated with the preparation of theConsolidated Financi
al Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functionalcurrency. While the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside theU.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency a
nd translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As aresult, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currenc
ies where our subsidiaries outside the U.S. report could causesignificant fluctuations in our results. In addition, whi
le our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the samecurrency as corresponding sales, we have transaction ex
posure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary'sfunctional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increas
e as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financialposition and results of operations could b
e affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies. See Item 7A. —Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
to this Form 10-K for further information. We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.
We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sal
e commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and othercommodities to lower our financial exposure relate
d to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price orindexed forward physical purchase a
nd sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or onexchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us mana
ge our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of ourassets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we
have in place may not always perform as planned. In particul
ar, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices orinterest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices
may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to
the extent we have unhedged or inad
equately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedgeaccounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increas
ed61

volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk" which is the difference in performance between thehedge instrument and the targeted underlyin
g exposure. Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may failor are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangeme
nts.Our coal-fired facilities in the U.S. continue to face substantial chal
lenges as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, particularlythose which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meanin
g those businesses that have aPPA in place but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. For our businesses with PPA pricin
g that does not perfectly passthrough our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexi
ble fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuelsupply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resultin
g commodity exposure could have a materialimpact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.
Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.
We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppl
iers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other servicesrequired for the operation of certain of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would se
ek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasingfuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be avail
able during certain periods at anyprice, which could adversely impact the profitabil
ity of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach ofagreements with other counterparties, including, with
out limitation, offtakers or lenders.At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases u
nderlong-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipate
d revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion ofour exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price p
ower sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unableto perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existi
ng agreements, or at all. Ifwe were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these b
usinesses may have to sell power at market prices. A breach by a counterparty of a PPA orother agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, incl
uding, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligati
ons to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a materialadverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the fina
ncial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continuedperformance by, suppliers and customers.
The market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods.
The market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substanti
ally in thefuture. Stock price movements on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the past two years are presented in Item 5.— 
Market — Market Information of this Form 10-K. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our in
dustry, in the power markets inwhich we participate and in the world, inc
luding environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well asdevelopments specific to us, including, risks that could resu
lt in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in Item 1A.—Risk Factors 
and those matters described in Item 7.— Management's Discussion and An alysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations . Risks Associated with our Operations
We do a significant amount of business outside the U.S., including 
in developing countries, which presents significant risks.A significant amount of our revenue is generated outsi
de the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted indeveloping countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our busi
ness in certain developing countries in which AES has an existing presenceas such countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities to exp
and from our platforms, with potentially higher returns than insome more developed countries. International op
erations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries,entail significant risks and uncertainties, inc
luding, without limitation:•
economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;•
adverse changes in currency exchange rates;•
government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;•
unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;62

•high inflation and monetary fluctuations;•
restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;•
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;•
risks relating to the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws applicableto our operations;
•
difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise;•
unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous tosubsidiaries of the Company and econ
omically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties aregovernments or private parties;
•
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;•
adverse changes in government tax policy;•
difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and•
potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adverse
ly affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Our operations may experi
ence volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to causesignificant volatility in our results of operations an
d cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability andcurrency devaluations being exp
erienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertaintyassociated with cash flows from these businesses. A number of our busin
esses are facing challenges associated with regulatory changes. The operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilit
ies involves significant risks that could adversely affect ourfinancial results. We and/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.
We are in the business of generating and distributi
ng electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operatingperformance, including:
•
changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages,equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptio
ns in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability tocomply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures,
explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
•
changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation;purchased electricity; operations, maintenance a
nd repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets andcapital expenditures to install enviro
nmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.Our businesses require reliable transportation so
urces (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and watersources to access and conduct operations. The avail
ability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of productionand sales. Limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiari
es, including as a result of third parties intentionally orunintentionally disruptin
g this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have amaterial adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financ
ial condition and prospects.In addition, a portion of our generation facilities w
ere constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capitalexpenditures for maintenance. The equipme
nt at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair,and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances w
here we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers.The inability to obtain replacement eq
uipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact onour business and results of operations. Breakdow
n or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing underapplicable power sales a
greements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence ofa liability for
63

liquidated damages and/or other penalties.As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associate
d with the power generation, distribution and transmission industries, wemay from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have a
dequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage.Power generation involves haz
ardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipmentand delivering electricity to transmission and d
istribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes andwind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse a
nd machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequateinternal processes, technological fla
ws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and management of these risksdepend upon adequ
ate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans andspecific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do n
ot eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of theserisks.
The hazards described above, alon
g with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss oflife, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equi
pment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension ofoperations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our bein
g named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantialdamages, environmental cleanup costs, person
al injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe iscustomary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficie
nt or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards orliabilities to which we may be subj
ect. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harmour financial condition. Further, due to the cyclical nature of the ins
urance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage willcontinue to be available on terms similar to those presently av
ailable to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition, results of operatio
ns or cash flows.Our businesses' insurance does not cover every potenti
al risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is notalways obtainable. In additio
n, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipmentfailure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adv
erse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effecton the Company's business, results or operations, financ
ial condition and prospects.Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our busin
ess and results of operations.We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives dep
ends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retainadditional qualifie
d personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in ourforeign businesses. The inabil
ity to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of thedifficulty of promptly finding qualified replac
ements. For example, we routinely are required to assess the financial impacts of complicated businesstransactions which occur on a worldwide b
asis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertisein U.S. GAAP to timely and accurately comply with U.S. reporting obligati
ons. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerialcontrols and hire and retain qualifie
d personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial and tax reporting.We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult 
to predict andplan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses.
We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply po
wer to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertaintyregarding the amount of power that our power generation a
nd distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase ouroperating costs. A significant under- or over-estimation of load requireme
nts could result in our facilities not having enough or having too muchpower to cover their obligations, in which case w
e would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Thoseprices may not be favorable and thus could increase o
ur operating costs.We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatili
ty in our results of operations. Even when wesuccessfully enter into long-term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and
a limited number of fuel suppliers.
Many of our generation plants conduct business u
nder long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks byreducing the volatility associated with p
ower and input costs and providing a64

stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of,and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and reve
nues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power salescontracts of our generation plants range from one to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations i
n fuel prices by enteringinto long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operati
ons are dependent on thecontinued ability of customers and suppli
ers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively.Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply co
ntracts areat prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply co
ntracts, or the failure by any of the parties tosuch contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereund
er, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceedrevenue, which could have a material adv
erse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending onmarket conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or
for new development projects. The inability to enter into lo
ng-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at marketprices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.
We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sal
es contracts with utilities orother customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarante
es from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. However,many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our ge
neration business cannot always obtaingovernment guarantees and if they do, the government does not al
ways have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce ourcredit risk by locating our plants in different geographic are
as in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can beno assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.
Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.
The power production markets in which we operate are ch
aracterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may haveextensive and diversified devel
opmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to orgreater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong a
nd increasing competition with respectto both obtaining power sales agreeme
nts and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductionsin prices contained in new pow
er sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets throughcompetitive bidding practices. The evoluti
on of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants havealso caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain p
ower markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factorscould have a material adverse effect on us.
Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligat
ions may require additionalsignificant contributions.
Certain of our subsidiaries have define
d benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the thirty one suchdefined benefit plans, five are at U.S. subsidiaries a
nd the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number ofactuarial assumptions, including a
n expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiariesand the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pensi
on obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong,resulting in a shortfall of pension plan ass
ets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates thevalue of the pension plan assets to ensure that they wil
l be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Company's exposure to marketvolatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest pla
ns include a significant weighting of investments infixed income securities that are less volatile than investments in e
quity securities. Future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or theinaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underly
ing the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase inpension expense and future fundi
ng requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible forsatisfying the funding requirements required by la
w in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pensionobligations under the pensi
on plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the ParentCompany and our subsidia
ries' liquidity.For additional information regarding the fun
ding position of the Company's pension plans, see Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Cond
ition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Pension and Other Postretirement Plansand Note 15— 
Benefit Plans included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data included in this Form 10-K. 65

Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties.Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in vari
ous stages of developing and constructing power plants, some but not all of which havesigned long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion d
epends upon overcoming substantialrisks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, eng
ineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals,commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sal
es contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. For additionalinformation regarding our projects under construction see Item 1.— 
Business — Our Organization and Segments included in this Form 10-K. In certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligatio
ns in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet securedfinancing, power purchase arrangements, or other aspects of the devel
opment process. For example, in certain cases, our subsidiaries may instructcontractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even wh
ere they do not have financing or a power purchase agreementin place (or conversely, to enter into a power purchase, procurement or other agreement witho
ut financing in place). If the project does not proceed,our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain li
abilities even though the project will not proceed. Development is inherently uncertain and wemay forgo certain development opportunities and w
e may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed witha particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under dev
elopment are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that anyindividual project will b
e completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a projectunder development and write off the costs incurred in connecti
on with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalizeddevelopment costs incurred in connection there
with and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority shareholders or we own less
than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherw
ise control the project or business, which entailscertain risks.
We have invested in some joint ventures where our subsi
diaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights withour joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a manageme
nt contract, by holding positions onthe board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain l
imited governance rights, such as rights to vetosignificant actions. However, we do not always h
ave this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependenton our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise co
ntrol such projects orbusinesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of exp
erience, technical expertise,human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these proj
ects or businesses optimally, and they may not share ourbusiness priorities. In some joint venture agreements where we d
o have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholderagreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders.
The approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distrib
utions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer ourinterest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by o
ur joint venture partners may result in operational management and/orinvestment decisions which are different from the decisions our subs
idiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact theprofitability and value of these joint ventures. In additi
on, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwiseunable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liab
ilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for thesejoint ventures, if and to the extent provided for in our governing docume
nts or applicable law.Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and
regulatory challenges.
Wind generation, our solar projects and our investments in proj
ects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of thisnature have been develope
d through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and whichare unrelated to our core business. Some of these business li
nes are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continuedinvestment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which suc
h favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.Furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dep
endent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility inproduction levels and profitabil
ity. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when availableand on wind resource studies conducte
d by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any givenyear.
66

As a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorableregulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In additio
n, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise ingeneration and utility business
es, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at thedevelopment or acquisition stage, beca
use of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, ourability to predict actual performance results may be hindered an
d the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with thefact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be
unavailable, which in turn may result in these pro
jects having relatively high levels of volatility. Even where available, many of our renewable projectssell power under a Feed-in-Tariff, which may be elimin
ated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of these projects, or make money throughthe sale of Emission Reductions products, such as Certified Emiss
ions Reductions, Renewable Energy Certificates or Renewable ObligationCertificates, and the price of these products may be volatile. These projects can be ca
pital-intensive and generally are designed with a view toobtaining third party financing, which may be d
ifficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projectsor obtain third party financing for these projects.
Impairment of goodwill or long-l
ived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of 
December 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill, which rep resented approximately 3.2% of the total assets on its Consolidated Balanc
e Sheets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairmentindicators are present. We may be required to evaluate the potential imp
airment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if weexperience situations, includi
ng but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment;increased competitive environment; increase in fue
l costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; negative ordeclining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are un
able to replace it on equally favorable terms; divestiture of asignificant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessme
nts by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses couldresult in goodwill impairment, which cou
ld substantially affect our results of operations for those periods. Additionally, goodwill may be impaired if ouracquisitions do not perform as expected. See the risk factor 
Our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion. Long-lived assets are initially recorde
d at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets areevaluated for impairment only when impairment ind
icators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present, whereas goodwill is alsoevaluated for impairment on an annual bas
is.Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.
Our businesses are affected by variations in general we
ather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales onthe basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical averag
e. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patternsand potential impacts on our facilities and o
ur businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which canadversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in wi
nter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected andsummers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less d
emand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations fromnormal weather where our businesses are locate
d could have a material impact on our results of operations.In addition, we are dependent upo
n hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which ourhydroelectric generation facilities are loc
ated. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectricgeneration business, our results of operations cou
ld be materially adversely affected.Information security breaches could harm our business.
A security breach of our information technology systems or plant control systems used to manage and mon
itor operations could impact thereliability of our generation fleets and/or the relia
bility of our transmission and distribution systems. A security breach that impairs our technologyinfrastructure could disrupt normal business operations a
nd affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution assets, access customerinformation and limit our communications with third parties. Our security measures may not prevent such security breaches. Any l
oss or corruptionof confidential or proprietary data through a breach coul
d impair our reputation, expose us to legal claims, or impact our ability to make collections orotherwise impact our operations, and materially adverse
ly affect our business and results of operations.67

Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.Historically, acquisitions have be
en a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions.Although acquired busin
esses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of thesebusinesses and possibly limite
d or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businessesmay have been government owned and some may be o
perated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquireany of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:
•
we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;•
such businesses will perform as expected;•
integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;•
we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;•
such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed todevelop them; or
•
the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws
Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely
affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.
Our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to cha
nges in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected orcontracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of
operations or our ability to meet publicly anno
unced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes inthe application or interpretation of regulatory provisi
ons in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs aresubject to regulatory review or approval, could adverse
ly affect our business, including, but not limited to:•
changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rateswe charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrad
e our power plants to comply with more stringent environmentalregulations;
•
changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or therates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;
•
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;•
adverse changes in tax law;•
changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill theirobligations (includin
g payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;•
changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;•
changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;•
changes in the timing of tariff increases;•
other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;•
other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or•
other changes that impact the short or long term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which ca
n adversely affect our business.In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory env
ironment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact ofthe regulations on our businesses. On July 21, 201
0, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act. While the bulk of regulations contained in theDodd-Frank Act regulate financial institutio
ns and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executivecompensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to pub
lic companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently notexpected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Do
dd-Frank Act substantially expands theregulation regarding the trading, cleari
ng and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for commercial end-user exemptionswhich may apply to our derivative transactions. However, even w
ith the exemption, the Dodd-Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on68

the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non-exempt companies), could limit theavailability of derivative transactions that we use to reduc
e interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to theserisks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactio
ns may increase, which could adversely (1) affect theoperating results of certain projects; (2) cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually ob
ligated to hedge certain risks,such as project financing agreements; (3) prevent us from developing n
ew projects where interest rate hedging is required; (4) cause the Companyto abandon certain of its hedging strategies an
d transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; (5)and/or consume substantial liquid
ity by forcing the Company to post cash and/or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. In additionto the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2012, the EMIR became effective. EMIR includes regulations rel
ated to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivativesand the impacts described above could a
lso result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with EMIR. It is also possible that additionalsimilar regulations may be passed in other jurisd
ictions where we conduct business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect onthe Company.
Our business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in who
le or in part by theFERC and NERC, including PURPA, the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC, NERC and by state utility
commissions can have a material effect on our operations.
EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the oblig
ation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for thepurchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable
presumption that utilities located within the control are
as of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM Interconnection,L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the NYISO and the Electric Reliability Cou
ncil of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or toQFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized un
der EPAct 2005 to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on acase-by-case basis. While this law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PUR
PA, our QFs may face a more difficult marketenvironment when their current long-term contracts expire.
EPAct 2005 repealed PUHC
A 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companiesto operate in geographically proximate reg
ions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. Bycomparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions a
nd simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the booksand records of certain utility holding compani
es. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations whichcould result in the creation of large, geographic
ally dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength andtherefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S. generati
on market.In accordance with Congressional man
dates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition inwholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowerin
g our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC hasencouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand resp
onse bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. Theseprograms may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very hi
gh prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs.Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the constructio
n of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although newtransmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increas
e the competition in our existing markets.While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions hav
e reversed course and begun to encourage theconstruction of generation facilities by traditiona
l utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect ofreducing sale opportunities in the comp
etitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate.FERC has civil penalty authority over violati
ons of any provision of Part II of the FPA which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, aswell as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is auth
orized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that theviolation continues. The FPA also prov
ides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penaltyauthority was enhanced in EPAct 200
5. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentiallyhave more serious consequences than in the p
ast.Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FE
RC as the Electric Reliability Organization ("ERO") to develop mandatory andenforceable electric system reliability standards ap
plicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standardsare subject to FERC review and approval.
69

Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizationswith responsibility for auditing, investig
ating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetarypenalties of up to $1 million per day per viol
ation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.Our utility businesses in the U.S. face significant regulatio
n by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion isreasonably broad in both Indian
a and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase,or lease of electric generating facilities, the classificati
on of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, theissuance of certain securities, the acquisition an
d sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businessesface the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which cou
ld have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition,and cash flows. See Item 1.— 
Business — US SBU — U.S. Businesses — U.S. Utilities for further information on the regulation faced by our U.S. utilities.
Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.
Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws a
nd regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, internationaltreaties and foreign governmental authorities. These l
aws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use ofwater, wetlands preservation, remediation of contaminatio
n, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure tocomply with such laws and regulations or to obtai
n or comply with any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations couldresult in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and reg
ulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended tobecome more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governme
ntal authorities have either considered or implementedvarious laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those i
nvolving air emissions and water discharges. See the variousdescriptions of these laws and regulatio
ns contained in Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K. These laws and regulations have impose d, andproposed laws and regulatio
ns could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continueto incur significant capital and other expen
ditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or newdevelopment of, environmental restrictions may force the Company to incur signific
ant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. Therecan be no assurance that we would be ab
le to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financialcondition, including recorde
d asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or anychanges in domestic or foreign environmental l
aws and regulations.Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies.
The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiativ
e against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source reviewand prevention of significant deterioratio
n provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtainedsettlements with many of these companies over such allegatio
ns. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modificationsto a coal-fired generating unit without proper permit approva
l and without installing best available control technology. The principal, but not exclusive,focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO 
2 and NO x . In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines andrequired companies to install improved po
llution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO 2 and NO x . There can be no assurance that foreignenvironmental regulatory agencies i
n countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant lawsand regulations.
Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas,
or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
As discussed in Item 1.— 
Business , at the international, federal and various regiona l and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are underdevelopment to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emiss
ions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them.In 
2016 , the Company's subsidiaries operated bus inesses which had total CO 2 emissions of approximately 67.7 million metric tonnes,approximately 30.2 million of which were emitted by b
usinesses located in the U.S. (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO 2 emission estimation methodologies su
pported by "The Greenhouse Gas Protocol" reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing powergeneration plants, CO 
2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuelheat inputs and fuel type CO 
2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of theCompany's
70

subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately7.7 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overa
ll estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to beincorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO 
2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion ofsuch construction and development projects. How
ever, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed willincrease emissions of our portfolio and therefore could i
ncrease the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions. Because there is significantuncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects und
er construction or development may vary substantially from theseestimates.
The non-utility, generation subsidi
aries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO 2 emissions to contract counterparties,but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the Comp
any will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that thecost and burden associated with any disp
ute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries ofthe Company. The utility subsidiaries of the Company may seek to pass o
n any costs arising from CO 2 emissions to customers, but there can be noassurance that such subsidiaries of the Company wi
ll effectively pass such costs to the customers, or that they will be able to fully or timely recoversuch costs.
Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions cou
ld have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial performance.The actual impact on the Company's financia
l performance and the financial performance of the Company's subsidiaries will depend on a number offactors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reducti
ons required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost ofemissions reduction equipment and the pric
e and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, theextent to which our subsidiaries would b
e entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on theopen market and the impact of such legislation or regulati
on on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases orotherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and co
uld have a material adverse impact on our results ofoperations.
In January 2005, based on European C
ommunity "Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading," the EU ETScommenced operation as the largest multi-country GHG emission trading scheme in the w
orld. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol becameeffective. The Kyoto Protocol requires all develop
ed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO 2 .However, the United States never ratified the Kyoto Protocol and, to date, compli
ance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had amaterial adverse effect on the Company's consolidate
d results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In December 2015, the Parties to the United Nations Framework Conve
ntion on Climate Change ("UNFCCC") convened for the 21stConference of the Parties in Paris, France. The result was the so-called Paris A
greement. The Paris Agreement has a long-term goal of keeping theincrease in global average temperature to we
ll below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In furtherance of this goal, participating countries submittedcomprehensive national climate actio
n plans and have agreed to meet every five years to set more ambitious targets as required by science, toreport to each other and the public on how well they are d
oing to implement their targets and to track progress towards the long-term goal through arobust transparency and accountability system. We anticipate that the Paris Agreeme
nt will continue the trend towards the efforts to de-carbonizethe global economy and to further limit GHG emissions, includin
g in those countries where the Company does business. It is difficult to predict thenature, timing and scope of such regulation but it could h
ave a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.In the U.S., there currently is no federal legislation imposing a mand
atory GHG emission reduction programs (including for CO 2 ) affecting theelectric power generation facilities of the Compa
ny's subsidiaries. However, the EPA has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions thatrequire new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing so
urces planning physical changes that would increase theirGHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification.
Additionally, the EPA has promulg
ated a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for CO 2 emissions for newly constructed andmodified/reconstructed fossil-fueled EUSGUs larger than 2
5 MW. The EPA has also promulgated a rule, the CPP, which requires existing EUSGUsto begin reducing GHG emissions starting in 2022 w
ith the full reduction requirement in 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to develop andsubmit plans that establish performance standards or, through emissions tradi
ng programs, otherwise meet a state-wide emissions rate average ormass-based goal. For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emission, inclu
ding the U.S. Supreme Court's issued an order stayingimplementation of the CPP, see Item 1. 
—Business—Environmental and L and-Use Regulations—United States Environmental and Land-UseLegislation and Regulations—G
reenhouse Gas Emissions above. 71

Such regulations, and in particular regulations applying to modified or existing EUSGUs, could increase our costs directly and indirectly andhave a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. Se
e Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regu
lations.At the state level, the RGGI, a cap-and-trade program covering CO 
2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast,became effective in January 2009, and Californ
ia has adopted comprehensive legislation and regulation that requires GHG reductions from multipleindustrial sectors, including the electric pow
er generation industry. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below) andproposed Hawaii regulati
ons relating to the collection of fees on GHG emissions, the impact of both of which we do not expect to be material, theCompany cannot estimate the costs of compliance with U.S. federal, region
al or state GHG emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to thefact that most of these proposals are not being actively pursued or are in the early stages of devel
opment and any final regulations or laws, ifadopted, could vary drastically from current proposals; in the case of Californi
a, we anticipate no material impact due to the fact that we expect suchcosts will be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tolling agreeme
nts.The auctions of RGGI allowances needed by p
ower generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI occur approximately everyquarter. Our subsidiary in Maryland is our only subsidiary that was subj
ect to RGGI in 2016 . Of the approximately 30.2 million metric tonnes of CO 2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 
2016 (ownership adjusted), approximately 1.1 milli on metric tonnes were emitted by oursubsidiary in Maryland. The Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs coul
d be approximately $3.2 million for 2017 . There is a risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could u
nderestimate our costs ofcompliance.
In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politic
ians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasingconcern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial instituti
ons have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities whichwould emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain ca
pital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. Further, ratingagencies may decide to downgrad
e our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increasedcompliance costs which could make financ
ing unattractive. In addition, plaintiffs have brought tort lawsuits against the Company because of itssubsidiaries' GHG emissions. While the litigati
on mentioned has been dismissed, it is impossible to predict whether similar future lawsuits are likelyto prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. Conseque
ntly, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a materialadverse effect on the Company's consolidated resu
lts of operations and financial condition.Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Ch
ange, physical risks from climate change could include, but are notlimited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak disc
harge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sealevel, changes and variabil
ity in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potentialto significantly affect the Company's business and o
perations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtainfinancing. For example, extreme weather events could result in incre
ased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric powergeneration facilities and supp
ort facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity alsowould be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in en
ergy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Company'ssubsidiaries. In addition, while reve
nues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase couldprompt the need for additional investment in generati
on capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation thatresult in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel-fired e
lectric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries.Changes in temperature, precipitation and sn
ow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergov
ernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of theCompany and its subsidiaries due to pu
blic perception of GHG emissions by the Company's subsidiaries, and any such negative public perceptionor concerns could ultimately result in a decreased dema
nd for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHGemissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is n
ot a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company.If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could b
e a material adverse effect on theelectric power generation business
es of the Company's subsidiaries and on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial conditionand cash flows.
72

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our subsidiaries have operations in the U.S. and vari
ous non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of theU.S. federal, state and local governments and of many non-U.S. jurisdictio
ns. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that couldadversely affect our overall tax positions regarding inc
ome or other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments willnot be adversely affected by these legislative measures.
For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change corporate tax rates, business rul
es such as interestdeductibility and capital exp
enditure cost recovery, and U.S. international tax rules. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determinehow and where cross-border international trade is su
bjected to tax are evolving. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development("OECD"), in coordination with the G8 and G20, through its Base Erosion and Profit Sh
ifting project (“BEPS") introduced a series ofrecommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopte
d, or may adopt in the future, as law. As these and other tax laws, related regulations anddouble-tax conventions chang
e, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and theirpotential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess wheth
er the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive ornegative for our earnings and cash flow, but such chan
ges could adversely impact our results of operations.In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as non-U.S., tax laws and reg
ulations are extremely complex and subject to varyinginterpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions wi
ll be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, therecould be a material impact on our results of operations.
We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.
We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regu
latory proceedings. See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolid
ated financial position.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We maintain offices in many places around the world, gen
erally pursuant to the provisions of long- and short-term leases, none of which webelieve are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are d
escribed in Item 1 —Business of this Form 10-K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the project's related finance facil
ity. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased.However, in a few instances, no accompanying pro
ject financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not besubject to any encumbrance and is owned o
utright by the subsidiary or affiliate.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in certain cla
ims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company has accrued forlitigation and claims where it is probab
le that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Companybelieves, based upon information it currently poss
esses and taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurancecoverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actio
ns is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financialstatements. It is reasonably possible, however, that some matters could be decided unfav
orably to the Company and could require the Company topay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could b
e material but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2016.In 1989, Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A. (“Eletrobrás”) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the state of Rio de Janeiro (“FDC”) agai
nstEletropaulo Eletricidade d
e São Paulo S.A. (“EEDSP”) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties' financingagreement. In April 1999, the FDC found in favor of Eletrobrás and in Se
ptember 2001, Eletrobrás initiated an execution suit in the FDC to collectapproximately 
R$2.0 billion ( $602 million ) from Eletropaulo as estimated by Eletropaulo (or approximately R$2.6 billion ( $802 million ) as of September 2016, as estimated by Eletrobrás, and possibly l
egal costs) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia deTransmissão de Energia Elétrica Paul
ista (“CTEEP”) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off of EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). InNovember 2002, the FDC rejected Eletropaul
o's defenses in the execution suit. On appeal, the case was remanded to the FDC for furtherproceedings to determine whether Eletropa
ulo is liable for the debt. In December 2012, the FDC issued a decision that Eletropaulo is liable for the73

debt. However, that decision was annulled on appeal and the case was remanded to the FDC for further proceedings. On remand at the FDC, theFDC appointed an accountin
g expert to analyze the issues in the case. In September 2015, the expert issued a preliminary report concluding thatEletropaulo is liable for the debt, without qu
antifying the debt. Eletropaulo thereafter submitted questions to the expert and reports rebutting theexpert's preliminary report. In April 2016, Eletrobrás requested that the expert determine both the criteria to calc
ulate the debt and the amount of thedebt. The FDC is considering whether the criteria can be d
etermined by the expert or must be determined by the FDC. After that issue is resolved, t he expert may issue a final report. Ultimately, a decision will be iss
ued by the FDC, which will be free to reject or adopt in whole or in part theexpert's report. If the FDC again determines that Eletropaulo is liabl
e for the debt, Eletrobrás will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the FDC.If Eletrobrás does so, Eletropaulo will be require
d to provide security for its alleged liability. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit inthe FDC against Eletrobrás and Eletropau
lo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. Eletropaulobelieves it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted aga
inst it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be noassurances that it will be successful in its efforts. If Eletrobrás requests the seizure of the security noted above and the FDC gra
nts such request (orif a court determines that Eletropaulo is liable for the debt), Eletropaul
o's results of operations may be materially adversely affected and, in turn, theCompany's results of operations may also be materially adv
ersely affected. Eletropaulo and the Company could face a loss of earnings and/or cashflows and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected busi
nesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value, and/or face thepossibility that Eletropaulo cann
ot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impacton the Company.
In September 1996, a public civil action was ass
erted against Eletropaulo and Associação Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the “Associação”)relating to alleged environmenta
l damage caused by construction of the Associação near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that wasupheld by the Appellate Co
urt of the state of São Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage bydemolishing certain construction and reforestin
g the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$2 million ( $614 thousand 
) as of December 31, 2015, or pay an indemnification amount of approximate ly R$15 million ( $5 million ). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court affirmed the decisi
on of the Appellate Court. Following the Supreme Court's decision, thecase has been remanded to the court of first instance for further proceedings and to monitor complianc
e by the defendants with the terms of thedecision. In January 2014, Eletropaul
o informed the court that it intended to comply with the court's decision by donating a green area inside aprotection zone and restore watersheds, the aggregate cost of which is ex
pected to be approximately R$2 million ( $614 thousand ). Eletropaulo also requested that the court add the current owner of the land where the Associ
ação facilities are located, Empresa Metropolitana de Águas eEnergia S.A. (“EMAE”), as a party to the lawsuit and order EMAE to perform the demolition and reforestation aspects of the court's decisio
n. In July2014, the court requested the Secretary of the Environment for the State of São Paulo to notify the court of its opinion regard
ing the acceptability ofthe green areas to be donated by Eletropaul
o to the State of São Paulo. In January 2015, the Secretary of the Environment for the State of SãoPaulo notified Eletropaul
o and the court that it would not accept Eletropaulo's proposed green areas donation. Instead of such green areas donation,the Secretary of the Environment proposed in March 2015 that Eletropau
lo undertake an environmental project to offset the alleged environmentaldamage. Since March 2015, Eletropaulo a
nd the Secretary of Environment have been working together to define an environmental project, whichwill be submitted for approval by the Public Prosec
utor. The cost of such project is currently estimated to be R$3 million ( $1 million ). In December 2001, GRIDCO served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and C
onciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AESOrissa Distribution Private Limited (“AES ODPL”), and Jyoti Structures (“Jyoti”) pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between
GRIDCO, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electricity Supply Comp
any of Orissa Ltd. (“CESCO”), an affiliate of the Company. In thearbitration, GRIDCO asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Company
's indirect investment in CESCOobligates the Company to provide add
itional financial support to cover all of CESCO's financial obligations to GRIDCO. GRIDCO appeared to beseeking approximately $189 mill
ion in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed byGRIDCO. The Company counterclaimed against GRIDCO for damages. In June 200
7, a 2-to-1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its awardrejecting GRIDCO's claims and holding that no
ne of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to GRIDCO. Therespondents' counterclaims were also rejecte
d. A majority of the tribunal later awarded the respondents, including the Company, some of their costsrelating to the arbitration. GRIDCO filed challenges of the tribuna
l's awards with the local Indian court. GRIDCO's challenge of the costs award hasbeen dismissed by the court, but its challenge of the liab
ility award remains pending. The Company believes that it has74

meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurancesthat it will be successful in its efforts.
In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of São Paulo, Brazil (“MPF”) notified Eletropa
ulo that it had commencedan inquiry into the BNDES financi
ngs provided to AES Elpa and AES Transgás, the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control ofEletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo, an
d the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers. The MPF requested variousdocuments from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civi
l lawsuit in the Federal Court of São Paulo (“FCSP”)alleging that BNDES viol
ated Law 8429/92 (“the Administrative Misconduct Act”) and BNDES's internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa andAES Transgás loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elp
a and AES Transgás loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulo's preferredshares at a stock-market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulo's preferred shares to secure the loan prov
ided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing therestructurings of Light Serviços de Eletricidade S.A. and El
etropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transgás as defendants in thelawsuit because they allege
dly benefited from BNDES's alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims basedon the first, second, and fourth alleged violations note
d above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court ofAppeals (“FCA”) seeking to require the FCSP to consider al
l five alleged violations. In April 2015, the FCA issued a decision holding that the FCSPshould consider all five alle
ged violations. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transgás) have appealed the April 2015 decision tothe Superior Court of Justice. The lawsuit remains pendin
g before the FCSP. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana believe they have meritorious defensesto the allegations asserted against them and wi
ll defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that theywill be successful in their efforts.
Pursuant to their environmental audit, AES Sul an
d AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at apole factory that AES Florestal had been operatin
g. The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual deEnergia (“CEEE”), had been using those contami
nants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AESFlorestal communicated with Brazilian auth
orities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, theState Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil acti
on against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an orderrequiring the companies to recover the contaminated area l
ocated on the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximatelyR$6 million 
( $2 million ) to the state's Environmental Fund. In October 2011, the State Attorney Office filed a request for an injunction ordering the defendant companies to contain and remove the co
ntamination immediately. The court granted injunctive relief on October 18, 2011, but determinedonly that defendant CEEE was required to proce
ed with the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began the removal work in compliance with theinjunction. The removal costs are estimated to be approximately 
R$60 million ( $18 million ) and the work was completed in February 2014. In parallel with the removal activities, a court-appointe
d expert investigation took place, which was concluded in May 2014. The court-appointed expertfinal report was presented to the State Attorneys in October 2014, and in January 20
15 to the defendant companies. In March 2015, AES Sul andAES Florestal submitted comments and supplementary questi
ons regarding the expert report. The Company believes that it has meritoriousdefenses to the claims asserted against it and will defe
nd itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will besuccessful in its efforts.
In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreend
imentos S.A. (“AESU”) in Brazil initiated arbitration against YPF S.A. (“YPF”) seeking damages andother relief relating to YPF's breach of the parties' gas supply a
greement (“GSA”). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration against AESUand two unrelated parties, Companhia d
e Gas do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (“TGM”), claiming thatAESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and cause
d the termination of a transportation agreement (“TA”) between YPF and TGM (“YPF Arbitration”).YPF sought an unspecified amount of damag
es from AESU, a declaration that YPF's performance was excused under the GSA due to certainalleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaratio
n that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability againstYPF because of the allegedly on
erous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserted that ifAESU were found liable for terminating the GSA, AES
U should also be found liable for TGM's alleged losses, under the TA. In April 2011, thearbitrations were consolidated into a sin
gle proceeding. In May 2013, the arbitral tribunal issued an award finding YPF liable to AESU and TGM.Thereafter, in April 2016, the tribunal issued a damag
es award ordering YPF to pay damages to AESU and TGM. In January 2017, AESU and YPFsettled their dispute.
In October 2009, IPL received a NOV and Finding of Viol
ation from the EPA pursuant to the CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations ofthe CAA at IPL's three primarily coal-fired electric generating facil
ities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to the Preventionof Significant Deterioration and non
attainment75

New Source Review requirements under the CAA. IPL management previously met with EPA staff regarding possible resolutions of the NOV. At thistime, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases h
ave required companiesto pay civil penalties, install additi
onal pollution control technology on coal-fired electric generating units, retire existing generating units, and investin additional environmenta
l projects. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact onthe Company. IPL would seek recovery of any operating or capita
l expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated airemissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would b
e successful in that regard.In June 2011, the São Paulo Municip
al Tax Authority (the “Tax Authority”) filed 60 tax assessments in São Paulo administrative court againstEletropaulo, seeking to collect services tax (“ISS”) that allegedly h
ad not been paid on revenues for services rendered by Eletropaulo. Eletropaulochallenged the assessments on the groun
ds that the revenues at issue were not subject to ISS. In October 2013, the First Instance AdministrativeCourt (“FIAC”) determined that Eletropaulo was liable for ISS, interest, and related pen
alties totaling approximately R$3.3 billion ( $1.0 billion ) as estimated by Eletropaulo. Eletropaulo there
after appealed to the Second Instance Administrative Court (“SIAC”). In January 2016, the Tax Authoritynullified most of the ISS sought from Eletropaulo.In January 2017, the SIAC iss
ued a decision confirming the reduction and rejecting certain otheramounts of ISS as time-barred, but finding that Eletropaulo was liab
le for the remainder of ISS totaling approximately R$200 million ( $61 million ). The matter is on appeal before the Municipal Cou
ncil of Taxes. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses and will defend itself vigorously inthese proceedings; however, there can be no assura
nces that it will be successful in its efforts.In January 2012, the Brazil Federal Tax Authority issued a
n assessment alleging that AES Tietê had paid PIS and COFINS taxes from 2007 to2010 at a lower rate than the tax authority believed was ap
plicable. AES Tietê challenged the assessment on the grounds that the tax rate was setin the applicable legis
lation. In April 2013, the FIAC determined that AES Tietê should have calculated the taxes at the higher rate and that AESTietê was liable for unpaid taxes, interest, and pen
alties totaling approximately R$960 million ( $295 million ) as estimated by AES Tietê. AES Tietê appealed to the SIAC. In January 2015, the SIAC issue
d a decision in AES Tietê's favor, finding that AES Tietê was not liable for unpaid taxes. Thepublic prosecutor subsequently file
d an appeal, which was denied as untimely. The Tax Authority thereafter filed a motion for clarification of theSIAC's decision, which was den
ied in September 2016. The Tax Authority later filed a special appeal, but that appeal was rejected in October 2017.The Tax Authority has filed an interlocutory appea
l, which is pending. AES Tietê believes it has meritorious defenses to the claim and will defenditself vigorously in these proceedings; ho
wever, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.In January 2015, DPL received NOVs from the EPA allegi
ng violations of opacity at Stuart and Killen Stations, and in October 2015, IPLreceived a similar NOV alleging vio
lations at Petersburg Station. In February 2016, IPL received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of NewSource Review (“NSR”) and other CAA regulatio
ns, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. It is too early todetermine whether the NOVs could have a material impact on our bus
iness, financial condition or results of our operations. IPL would seek recoveryof any operating or capital expenditures, but not fines or pen
alties, related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air emissions;however, there can be no assurances that we would b

elopment, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC filed a lawsuit against the California CoastalCommission (the “CCC”) over the CCC's determination that the site of AES Redon
do Beach included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictionalwetlands. The CCC has asserted that AES Redo

d Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program and has ordered AES Redondo Beach to restore the site.Additional potential outcomes of the CC
C determination could include an order requiring AES Redondo Beach to fund a wetland mitigation projectand/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redon

In October 2015, Ganadera Guerra, S.A. (“GG”) and Constructora Tymsa, S.A. (“CT”) filed separate lawsuits against AES Panama in the local
courts of Panama. The claimants allege that AES Panama profite
d from a hydropower facility (La Estrella) being partially located on land ownedinitially 
by GG and currently by CT, and that AES Panama must pay compensation for its use of the land. The damages sou ght from AES Panamaare approximately $685 million (GG) and $100 mill
ion (CT). In October 2016, the court dismissed GG's claim because of GG's failure to comply witha court order requiring GG to disclose certain information. It is expected that GG will refile its lawsuit. Also, there are ongoin
g administrativeproceedings concerning wh

acquire an easement over the land and whether AES Panama can continue to occupy the land. AES Panama believes it has meritorious defensesand claims and will assert them

Capital Resources and LiquidityExecutive Summary
Consolidated Net Cash Provid
ed by Operating Activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2,884 million , an increase of $750 million 
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increas e was primarily driven by higher collections at the Company’s distributionbusiness in Brazil, Eletropaulo a
nd Sul, and the settlement of overdue receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria. These positive contributions were offset bylower margins across the SBUs (primarily due to lower wholes
ale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers in the U.S., lowercontracted rates in 
Tietê , the prior year liability reversal in Eletropaulo an d unfavorable FX in Kazakhstan), as well as the recovery of overduereceivables in the Dominican Re
public in 2015, which benefited80

2015 results. Proportional Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $176 million to $1,417million 
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the same factors as Conso lidated Net Cash Provided by OperatingActivities.

 Disclosure of Proportional Free Cash Flow will be discontinued beginning in the first quarter of 2017. See further discussion under SBU Performance Analysis—Non-GAAP Measures. Diluted earnings per share from continuing o
perations decreased primarily due to higher impairment expense on lo ng lived assets, lower gainson foreign currency derivatives, lower operating margins at our US, Brazi
l and Europe SBUs, and lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to thegain earned in 2015 from the restructuring of Guacolda; partially offset by a low
er effective tax rate, the absence of goodwill impairment expense inthe current year, lower losses on extinguishment of debt and low
er share count.Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, decreased by 
22% to $0.98 primarily driven by lower operating margins at our US, Brazil, and E uropeSBUs, lower equity in earnings of affiliates du
e to the gain earned in 2015 from the restructuring of Guacolda; partially offset by a lower adjustedeffective tax rate and lower share count.
Net cash provided by operating activities incre
ased by 35% to $2.9 billion primarily driven by an increase in collectio ns at our Brazil utilities, thecollection of overdue receivables at Maritza, and lo
wer costs associated with the fulfillment of our service concession arrangement and lowerworking capital requirements at Mong Duong. Thes
e positive impacts were partially offset by the timing of payments at our Brazil utilities for higherenergy purchases made in the prior year, collections of overdu
e receivables in the prior year in the Dominican Republic, and lower net incomeadjusted for non-cash items.
Proportional free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, increased by 
14% to $1.4 billion primarily driven by an increase in collectio ns at our Brazilutilities, the collection of overdue receivab
les at Maritza, and lower working capital requirements at Mong Duong. These positive impacts werepartially offset by the timing of payments at our Brazil utilities for higher energy purchases mad
e in the prior year, collections of overdue receivablesin the prior year in the Dominican Republ

$29 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , which was primarily related to the gain on sale of DPLE R,partially offset by a loss on the deconsolidatio
n of U.K. Wind.Gain on sale of businesses was 
$29 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , which was primarily related to the sale of Armenia Mountain.
Gain on disposal and sale of investments for the year ende
d December 31, 2014 was $358 million , which was primarily related to the sale of 45% of the Company's interest in Masinloc, as well as the sale of U.K. Wind (Operating Pro
jects).Goodwill impairment expense
There were 
no goodwill impairments for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Goodwill impairment expense was 
$317 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a goodwill impai rment at DP&L.Goodwill impairment expense was 
$164 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . This expense consisted of $136 million , $20 millionand 
$8 million of goodwill impairments at DPLER, Buffalo Gap II and Buffalo Gap I, respectively. See Note 
9 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further info
rmation.Asset impairment expense
Asset impairment expense was 
$1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 . This was primarily related to asset impairments of $859 million 
, $159 million and $77 million at DPL, Buffalo Gap II and Buffalo Gap I, respectively. Asset impairment expense was 
$285 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to asset impairments of $121 million , $116million 
and $37 million at Kilroot, Buffalo Gap III and U.K. Wind, respectively. Asset impairment expense was

and $12 million at Ebute, U.K. Wind and DPL, respectively. See Note 
20 — Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.
Income tax expense
Income tax decreased to a benefit of 
$188 million in 2016 as compared to expense of $472 million in 2015. The Company's effective tax rates were ( 
137% ) and 41% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. 85

The net decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the 2016 asset impairments in the U.S. and to the current year benefit related to a restructuring of one of our Brazilian businesses that increas
es tax basis in long-term assets. Further, the 2015 rate was impacted by theitems described below. See Note 20— 
Asset Impairment Expense for additional information regarding the 20 16 U.S. asset impairments.Income tax expense 
increase d $101 million , or 27% , to $472 million in 2015 . The Company's effective tax rates were 41% and 26% for the years ended December 31, 
2015 and 2014 , respectively.    The net 
increase in the 2015 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the nondeductible 2015 impairment of goo dwill at our U.S. utility, DP&L andChilean withholdi
ng taxes offset by the release of valuation allowance at certain of our businesses in Brazil, Vietnam and the U.S. Further, the 2014rate was impacted by the sale of approximately 45% of the Company’s interest in Masi
n AES Pte Ltd., which owns the Company’s businessinterests in the Philippines and the 2
014 sale of the Company’s interests in four U.K. wind operating projects. Neither of these transactions gave riseto income tax expense. See Note 
15 — Equity for additional information regarding the sal e of approximately 45% of the Company’s interest inMasin-AES Pte Ltd. See Note 
23 — Dispositions for additional information regarding the sal e of the Company’s interests in four U.K. wind operatingprojects.
Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S.
statutory rate of 35%. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign an
d domestic tax jurisdictionscould impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also ben
efits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specificcommitments regarding employment and capital investment. See Note 
21 — Income Taxes for additional information regarding these red uced rates.Foreign currency transaction gains (losses)

n loss of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to losses of 
$50 million at The AES Corporation mainly due to remeasurement losses o n intercompany notes, and losses on swaps and options.This loss was partially offset by gains of 
$37 million in Argentina, mainly due to the favorable impact of foreign currency deriv atives related togovernment receivables.
The Company recognized a net foreign currency transactio
n gain of $107 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to gains of:

SBU Performance AnalysisNon-GAAP Measures
Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, Adj
usted EPS, and Proportional Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP supplemental measures that areused by management and external users of our consoli
dated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.Adjusted Operating Margin
We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Operating Margin, ad
justed for the impact of NCI, excluding unrealized gains or losses related toderivative transactions. See 
Review of Consolidated Res ults of Operations for definitions of Operating Margin and cost of sales. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted Operating Margin is Operatin
g Margin. We believe that Adjusted Operating Margin betterreflects the underlying business performance of the Company. Factors in this determin
ation include the impact of NCI, where AES consolidates theresults of a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the Compa
ny, as well as the variability due to unrealized derivatives gains or losses. AdjustedOperating Margin should not be construed as an altern
ative to Operating Margin, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Margin (in millions)

Adjusted PTCWe define Adjusted PTC as pretax income from continuing o
perations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses due to(a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transacti
ons, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due todispositions and acquisiti
ons of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTCalso includes net equity in earni
ngs of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.Adjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified i
n the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of salesreflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC inclu
des the other components of our income statement, such as general and administrative expense in the corporate segment, as well as business devel
opment costs; interest expense and interest income ; other expense and other income ; realizedforeign currency transaction gains and losses 
; and net equity in earnings of affiliates . The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is 
income from continuing operations attributable to The A ES Corporation . We believe that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business p
erformance of the Company and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation offinancial performance. Factors in this determination inclu
de the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions,unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, loss
es due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retiredebt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In additio
n, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company beforethe application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, includin
g the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions inwhich the Company operates. Adjusted PTC sh

We define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activiti
es less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverableenvironmental capital expend
itures), adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. The proportionate share of cash flows and relatedadjustments attributable to noncontrolling i
nterests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliationbelow. Upon the Company's ado
ption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective January 1, 2015, capitalexpenditures related to service concession ass
ets that would have been classified as investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of CashFlows are now classified as operating activ
ities. See Note 1 —General and Summary of Significant Accounting P olicies of this Form 10-K for further information on the adoption of this guidanc
e.Beginning in the quarter ende
d March 31, 2015, the Company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flowsfor capital expenditures related to service concessio
n assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on theConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The prop
ortional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below.We also exclude environmental capita
l expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms.An example of recoverable environmental ca
pital expenditures is IPL's investment in MATS-related environmental upgrades that are recoveredthrough a tracker. See Item 1. 
—US SBU—IPL—Environmental Matters for details of these investments. The GAAP measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operatin
g activities. We believe that proportional freecash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the Compa
ny, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the fundingof maintenance capital expenditures, that may be avai
lable for investing in growth opportunities or repaying debt. Factors in this determinationinclude the impact of noncontrolling i
nterests, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company.92

The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash fromoperating activities, which is determined in acc
ordance with GAAP. Proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available fordiscretionary payments because it excludes certain p
ayments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirementsand dividend payments. Our definition of proportio
nal free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by othercompanies.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will no l
onger include these non-GAAP proportional free cash flow disclosures that have historicallybeen provided and will i
nstead disclose non-GAAP free cash flows only on a consolidated basis. Our use of proportional free cash flow was intendedto provide investors with an understanding of the portio
n of free cash flows attributable to AES after the impact of non-controlling interests. However,since the concept of a non-controlling interest is not contempl
ated under GAAP with respect to the statement of cash flows, we will no longer be ableto disclose proportional free cash flow in lig
ht of recent interpretive guidance issued by the SEC staff.Reconciliation of Proportional Free Cash Flow (in millions)

 Service concession asset expenditures are excluded from the proportional free cash flow non-GAAP metric.(2) 
 The proportional adjustment factor, proportional maintenance capital expenditures (net of reinsurance proceeds) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated bymultiplying the percentage 
owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures. For example, Parent Company A owns20% of Subsidiary Company B, a c
onsolidated subsidiary. Thus, Subsidiary Company B has an 80% noncontrolling interest. Assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $100 fromSubsidiary B, the proportional 
adjustment factor for Subsidiary B would equal $80 (or $100 x 80%). The Company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this mannerand then sums these amou
nts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation. The proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable tononcontrolling interests as a r
esult of (a) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and (b) AES' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur.(3) 
 Includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $15 million and $84 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company adoptedservice concession accounting 
effective January 1, 2015.(4) 
 Excludes IPL's proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $132 million , $205 million and $163 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

Parent Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP measure)The Company defines Parent Free Cash Flow as d
ividends and other distributions received from our operating businesses less certain cashcosts at the Parent Company level, primarily interest payments, overhead, and deve
lopment costs. Parent Free Cash Flow is used to fundshareholder dividends, share repurch
ases, growth investments, recourse debt repayments, and other uses by the Parent Company. Refer to Item 1—

Adjusted PTC increased $50 million , driven by the increase of $19 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described a bove, and the additionalnet impact of $28 million at Mong Duong due to a compon
ent of service concession revenue recognized as interest income, net of higher interestexpense as interest is no longer capitaliz
ed. See Note 1— General and Summary of Significant Accounting P olicies in Part II.—Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
for further information regarding the accounting for service concession arrang ements.Proportional Free Ca
sh Flow increased $5 million , primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted Operating Margi n of $28 million (net of $9 millionin non-cash items, primarily service concession expens
e and the102

retrospective adjustment to energy prices noted above), and $58 million in higher interest income recognized at Mong Duong as a result of thefinancing component under service conc
ession accounting. These positive impacts were partially offset by $26 million in higher working capitalrequirements at Mong Duong due to a build-up i
n preparation of the commencement of operations, $22 million in higher interest payments at MongDuong, $11 million of higher tax payments at Masinl
oc, and $9 million in higher working capital requirements at Masinloc due primarily to the timingof coal purchases.
Key Trends and Uncertainties
During 
2017 and beyond, we expect to face the following ch allenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improvedoperating performance at certain businesses, growth from new busin
esses and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. Ifthese favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described be
low and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than wecurrently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commoditi
es move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factorsunknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to The AE
S Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor ouroperations and address challe
nges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.— Business and Item 1A.— Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.
Macroeconomic and Political
During 2016, the political enviro
nments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed which could result insignificant impacts to tax laws, and environmental and e
nergy policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject tovolatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary lev
el. See Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Ab out Market Risk for furthe r information.Brazil 
— President Michel Temer, with majority congressional support, continues to implement the fiscal reforms needed to improve thecountry’s finances. While uncertainty dominates the pol
itical arena, if enacted, President Temer's market reforms would improve the the economicoutlook, which may benefit our businesses in Braz
il.In October 2016, AES completed the sale of the Company's 100% o
wnership interest in AES Sul and recognized an after-tax loss on disposalof $737 million. This after-tax loss excludes the impact of contingent proce
eds linked to the favorable settlement of pending litigation, which is notguaranteed. If the case is decided in the Company's favor, amounts wo
uld be remitted to AES over an unknown period of time. Any potential gainfrom the eventual resolution of this contingency woul
d be presented separately as Discontinued Operations.United Kingdom 
— On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union(“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of
the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is uncle
ar what the long-term global implications will be, it is possible that the European orU.K. economy could weaken and our busi
nesses may experience a decline in demand. While the full impact of the Brexit is uncertain, thesechanges may adversely affect our operations and financ
ial results. The most immediate impact has been a devaluation of the pound and euroagainst the U.S. dollar. For 2016 and 2017, the Compa
ny has hedged against these foreign currency movements, however, the impact could begreater in future years.
Puerto Rico 
— Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long term PPAs with state-owned PREPA. Due to the ongoing economic situation in theterritory, PREPA faces significant financial chall
enges. There have been no significant adverse impacts to AES Puerto Rico due to PREPA’sfinancial challenges.
If PREPA continues to face challenges, or those chal
lenges worsen, or otherwise impact PREPA’s ability to make payments to AES PuertoRico, there could be a material impact on the Company.
United States of America 
— The outcome of the 2016 U.S. elections could result in sign ificant changes to U.S. tax laws, and environmentaland energy policies, the impact of which is uncertai
n.Philippines 
— The outcome of the 2016 Philippines e lection could result in changes in policies towards the U.S., China or other nations theimpact of which on our business is uncertain.
Foreign Exchange and Commodities
Our businesses are exposed to and proactively mana
ge market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities,particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal and enviro
nmental credits. In 2016, there were more than 50% improvement in both oil and natural gasprices, which had a positive impact on our busin
esses in the Dominican Republic, Ohio and Northern Ireland. Since we operate in multiple countries,we are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying de
grees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the U.S.103

Dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. In 2016, we had a significant devaluation in the Argentine Peso. The Brazilian Real,Colombian Peso and Kazak
hstani Tenge recovered during the year, but remain devalued as compared to the beginning of 2015, which had anoffsetting impact on our 2016 results. For additional information, refer to Item 7A.— 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Ab out Market Risk.Alto Maipo
During 2016, the Alto Maipo project in Chi
le experienced technical difficulties in construction which resulted in an increase in projected costs ofup to 22% over the original $2 billio
n budget. These additional costs have led to a series of negotiations with the main contractors, financiers andpartners of the project, with the intention to restructure the existing financing and obta
in additional financing to guarantee project completion. OnJanuary 19, 2017, the parties agreed on the basis of the restructuring process, incl
uding new project milestones. These agreements are subject tothe negotiation and finalizati
on of the specific restructuring terms and conditions; and the negotiation and approval of the terms and conditions ofeach of the financing documents. Currently, the Company's in
direct equity interest in the project is 40%.Impairments
Long-lived Assets 
— During the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $1.1 billion . Due to decreased wind production an
d a decline in forward power curves in 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at BuffaloGap I, II, and III. After recognizing asset impairment expense of 
$236 million at Buffalo Gap I and II, the carrying value of the long-lived asset groups at Buffalo G
ap I, II, and III totaled $242 million at December 31, 2016 . Additionally, the Company recogn
ized an asset impairment expense of $859 million at DPL in 2016. After recognizing asset impairment expense at DPL, the carrying value of the long-live
d asset groups at DPL, including those that were not impaired, totaled $498 million at December 31, 2016 
. See Note 20 — Asset Impairment Expense in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data for furthe r informationregarding the impairments at Buffalo Gap and DPL.
Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate further recoverability tests and potentia
l impairments of long-lived assets mayinclude, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regu
latory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increasedcompetition due to additional cap
acity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likelythan not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previous
ly estimated useful life.Goodwill 
— The Company currently has no reporting units considered to be "at risk." A reporting unit is considered "at risk" when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. The Company monitors its reporting units at risk of Step 1 failure on a
n ongoing basis. It ispossible that the Company may incur goodwi
ll impairment charges at any reporting units containing goodwill in future periods if adverse changes intheir business or operating environments occur. See Note 
9 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
for furthe r information.Capital Resources and Liquidity
Overview — 
As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equiva lents of $1.3 billion , of which $100 million was held at the Parent Company and qualifi
ed holding companies. The Company also had $798 million in short term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries. In addition, we had restricted cash an
d debt service reserves of $871 million . The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstand
ing of $15.8 billion and $4.7 billion , respectively. Of the approximately $1.3 billion of our current non- recourse debt, 
$1.2 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelv e months and $128 million relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations. The defaults are not payme
nt defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with othercovenants and/or other conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information cove
nants, complete construction or other milestones in anallocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the n
on-recourse debt documents of theCompany.
104

We expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates orthrough opportunistic refinancing activity or some combin
ation thereof. None of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, private
ly negotiated transactions or otherwise when managementbelieves that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchas
es, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirementsand other factors. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be materia
l.We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activ
ities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilizednon-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital ex
penditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric powerplants, distribution companies and relate
d assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the Parent Company or othersubsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse lon
g-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Generally, a portion orall of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. In addition, the de
bt is typically denominated in the currency that matchesthe currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting proj
ect, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency ismatched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by i
nternational commercial banks, with debtcapacity supplemented by multilaterals an
d local regional banks.Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is sub
ject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. Whenpossible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed i
nterest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition,the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consol
idated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing theinterest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related
underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's o
nly material un-hedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under itsfloating rate senior unsecured notes due 20
19. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's $20.5 billion of total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016 
, approximately $3.5 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. Brazil holds $1.3 billion of our floating rate no
n-recourse exposure as we have no ability to fix local debt interest rates efficiently.In addition to utilizing non-recourse de
bt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instancesall, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund dev
elopment, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investmentshave generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, wh
ich are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. Wegenerally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the procee
ds fromour issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our business
es, the Parent Company may provide financialguarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered i
nto contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipmentor other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defa
ults on its payment or supply obligation, the ParentCompany will be responsibl
e for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. AtDecember 31, 2016 
, the Parent Company had provided outstandin g financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit supportcommitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately 
$535 million in aggregate (excluding those collateralize
d by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).As a result of the Parent Company's below investment grade rating, cou
nterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecuredcommitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Compa
ny may be required toprovide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to
provide adequate assurances to such cou
nterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to suchcounterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit availab
le to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2016 , we had $6 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our senior secured cred
it facility, $245 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our un- senior secured credit facility and 
$3 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding o utside of our senior secured credit facility. Theseletters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project develo
pment activities and business operations. During the year endedDecember 31, 2016 
, the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5%  per annum on the outstanding amounts. We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse de
bt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or ouraffiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depend
ing on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individualbusinesses, non-recourse debt may not be availa
ble105

on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is underconstruction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsi
diary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary maybecome insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsi
diary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, thesubsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidi
ary choose not to proceed with aproject or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse de
bt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely an
d continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raisecapital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebte
dness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economicuncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial cond
ition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in thetiming of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relev
ant concessions could affect the cash flows and results ofoperations of our businesses.
Long-Term Receivables — 
As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately $264 million of accounts receivable classified as Noncurrent assets—other 
related to certain of its generation businesses in Arge ntina and the U.S. and its utility business in Brazil. The noncurrentportion primarily consists of accounts receivable in Arge
ntina that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collectionperiods that extend beyond 
December 31, 2017 , or one year from the latest balance sheet date. The majority of Argentinian receivabl es have beenconverted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. See N

 $113 Parent Company Liquidity
The following discussion of Pare
nt Company Liquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available toThe AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the no
n-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as outlinedbelow is a non-GAAP measure and shou
ld not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordancewith GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Cash and cash equ
ivalents are disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Parent CompanyLiquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The princi
pal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level aredividends and other distributions from our subsid
iaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the ParentCompany level, including av
ailability under our credit facility; and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level areprimarily to fund interest; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments; common stock repurchases;
acquisitions; taxes; Parent Company overhead a
nd development costs; and dividends on common stock.The Company defines Parent Company Li
quidity as cash available to the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing creditfacility. The cash held at qualified hol
ding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S.. Suchsubsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on the
ir ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its mostdirectly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, 
Cash and cash equivalents , at December 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows: 115

  $894  $1,138 The Company paid dividen
ds of $0.44 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016 . While we intend  tocontinue payment of dividends and b
elieve we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to paydividends, or if continued, the amount of such divide
nds.Recourse Debt 
— Our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. See Note 11 — 
Debt in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail. While we believe that our sources of liquid
ity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number ofmaterial assumptions, including, without limitati
on, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see Key Trends and Uncertainties — Global Economic Conditions 
), the operating and financial performance of our subsidi aries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, andthe ability of our subsidiaries to pay divide
nds. In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Companylevel) is subject to certain limitations contained i
n loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that thesesources will be available w
hen needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors — TheAES Corporation is a holding comp
any and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, isdependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by w
ay of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise, of this Form 10-K. Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, inclu
ding our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. Thecovenants provide for — among other items — limitations on other indebted
ness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stockrepurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitatio
ns on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions withaffiliates and off-balance sheet and derivativ
e arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements.As of December 31, 
2016 , we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Comp any level.Non-Recourse Debt 
— While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financ ings generally do not have direct recourse to the ParentCompany, defaults thereunder can still have important cons
equences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:•
reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period ofany default;
•
triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or onbehalf of such subsidiary;
•
causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and•
triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company.For example, our senior secured credit facility and outstandin
g debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certainbankruptcy related events involving material su
bsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events ofdefault related to payment defaults and acceleratio
ns of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstan
ding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debtclassified as current in the accompanying Cons
olidated Balance Sheets amounts to $1.3 billion . The portion of current debt related to such defaults was 
$128 million  at December 31, 2016 , all of which was non-recourse debt related to two subsidi aries — Kavarna, and Sogrinsk. See Note 11 —Debt 
in Item 8.— Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail. None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsi
diaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under AES' corporate debtagreements as of 
December 31, 2016 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under AES' i ndebtedness.However, as a result of additional dispositi
ons of116

assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results ofoperations or the financial position of the in
dividual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a"material subsidiary" and thereby upon an accel
eration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the ParentCompany's outstanding debt securities. A material su
bsidiary is defined in the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility as any businessthat contributed 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal q
uarters.As of 
December 31, 2016 , none of the defaults listed above individ ually or in the aggregate results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default underthe recourse debt of the Company.

Excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.As of December 31, 
2016 , the Company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipmentthat were not included in the letters of credit disclosed abov
e.We have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractua
l obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risksand only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associ
ated with these obligations include change ofcontrol, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemniti
es, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidateddamages under power sales agreements for projects in dev
elopment, in operation and under construction. In addition, we have an asset saleprogram through which we may have customary indemnity obli
gations under certain assets sale agreements. While we do not expect that we will berequired to fund any material amounts under these conting
ent contractual obligations beyond 2016 , many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond o
ur control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingentcontractual obligations if we are required to make substa
ntial payments thereunder.117

Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe Consolidated Financ
ial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgmentsand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the fina
ncial statements and the reported amounts ofrevenue and expenses during the p
eriods presented. AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note  1 — General and Summary ofSignificant Accounting Poli
cies to the Consolidated Financia l Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requ
ires management to make assumptions about matters that were highlyuncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have b
een used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptionson financial condition or operati
ng performance is material.Management believes that the accounting estimates emp
loyed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actualresults could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these ba
lances in future periods. Management has discussedthese critical accounting policies w
ith the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accountingestimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Co
nsolidated Financial Statements.Income Taxes 
— We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictio ns. Our worldwide income tax provisionrequires significant judgment and is bas
ed on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service andother taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsid
iaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. TheCompany regularly assesses the potential o
utcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provisionfor income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in inc
ome taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves havebeen established, which the Comp
any believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reservesare adjusted only when there is more information avai
lable or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Companybelieves that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate o
utcome of current or future examinations may bematerially different than the reserve amounts.
Because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple juris
dictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographicalearnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adverse
ly impacted by changes in tax laws, taxtreaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more lik
ely or become more likely in view of recenteconomic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in whic
h we operate. As an example, new tax laws were enacted in February 2016 in Chile whichincreased the statutory income tax rate for most of our Chilean businesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 201
8 and future years.Accordingly, in 2016 our net Chile
an deferred tax liabilities were remeasured to the new rates. The remeasurement amount and other potentialfuture impacts of the changes in tax law may be material to continuing operati
ons. See Note 21 — Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
The Company's provision for income taxes could b
e adversely impacted by changes to the U.S. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.Since 2006, the Company has benefite
d from the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through rule, originally enacted in the TIPRA of 2005, subjectto five temporary extensions, including the most recent five year retroactive extension enacte
d on December 18, 2015 in the H.R.2029 -Consolidated Appropriati
ons Act, 2016. There can be no assurance that this provision will continue to be extended beyond December 31, 2019.Further, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change corporate tax rates, business rules such as interest de
ductibilityand capital expenditure cost recovery, and U.S. internatio
nal tax rules. Our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may bematerial to the Company should such reforms be enacted.
In addition, U.S. income taxes and foreign withhol
ding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S.subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are consi
dered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recogniz
ed for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statementcarrying amounts of the existing assets and liabiliti
es, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance whenit is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Sales of Noncontrolling Interests 
— The accounting for a sale of noncontrolling i nterests under the accounting standards depends onwhether the sale is considered to be a sale of in-substa
nce real estate (as118

opposed to an equity transaction), where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather than within stockholders' equity. Ifmanagement's estimation process determines that there is no signific
ant value beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of thenoncontrolling interest is recognize
d in earnings. However, if it is determined that significant value likely exists beyond the in-substance real estate,the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling i
nterest would be recognized within stockholders' equity. In-substance real estate is comprised ofland plus improvements and integral eq
uipment. The determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on thesignificance of the costs to remove the equipment from its existing location (inclu
ding the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal),combined with the decrease in the fair value of the equ
ipment as a result of those removal activities. When the combined total of removal costs andthe decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds 1
0% of the fair value of the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. Theaccounting standards specifically i
dentify power plants as an example of in-substance real estate. Where the consolidated entity in whichnoncontrolling interests have bee
n sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimates the extent to which the total fair value of theassets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether sig
nificant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. Thisestimation considers all qualitative a
nd quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitative estimatesabout the fair value of the entity and its identifiable assets an
d liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to theaccounting standards on business comb
inations. As such, these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the criticalaccounting estimates discussed belo
w for impairments and fair value.Impairments 
— Our accounting policies on goodw ill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 — General and Summary ofSignificant Accounting Poli
cies , included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable jud gments in its impairment evaluations ofgoodwill and long-l
ived assets; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation.The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long-l
ived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under thefair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and i
ncome approach are most relevant in the fair valuemeasurement of our reporting units and long-lived assets; how
ever, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in manycircumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The C
ompany may engage an independent valuation firm to assist managementwith the valuation. The decision to eng
age an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost-benefitanalysis and the Company's interna
l valuation knowledge of the long-lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlyingassumptions consistent with its internal budgets an
d forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flowvaluation model (the "DCF model"), based on the princip
les of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long-livedassets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair valu
e by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted toreflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.
Management applies considera
ble judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cashflow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to inc
lude macroeconomic factors such as growthrates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commod
ity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these inputassumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Un
it) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumptionis not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dep
endent on other economic assumptions, which are oftenderived from statistical economic models with inherent limitatio
ns such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based onhistorical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most signific
ant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations ofmacroeconomic factors which have been volatil
e recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of themacroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroecon
omic factors and related assumptions are often available in anarrow range; however, in some situations these ranges bec
ome wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantlydifferent budgets and cash flow forecasts.
A considerable amount of judgment is also a
pplied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputsto the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly
traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management app
lies judgment in the selection of such companiesbased on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the sel
ection of a different set of likely market participantscould produce different input assumptions an
d result in the use of a different discount rate.119

Fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecastsand the discount rate. Further, estimates of long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determinatio
n. As part of theimpairment evaluation process, management ana
lyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increasesas the gap between fair value and carrying amou
nt decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching adifferent conclusion regarding the potenti
al impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties fromuncontrollable events that could pos
itively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Comp
any can be found within Note 9 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,Note 
20 — Asset Impairment Expense and Note 8 — Other Non-Operating Expense to the Consolidated Financia l Statements included in Item 8 ofthis Form 10-K.
Fair Value
Fair Value Hierarchy 
— The Company uses valuation techniq ues and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs andminimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where avai
lable, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from suchprices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, val
uation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the availableobservable inputs. The valuation tech
niques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on theprice transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity.
To increase consistency and enhanc
e disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fairvalue hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value i
nto three categories. An asset or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy isbased on the lowest level of input sign
ificant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For moreinformation regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1— 
General and Summary of Significant Accounting P olicies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
— A significant number of the Company's financial i nstruments are carried at fair value with changes infair value recognized in earnings or other compreh
ensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets andliabilities measured at fair value in prep
aring the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long-terminvestments in debt and equity securities, includ
ed in the balance sheet line items Short-term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent) , derivative assets, included in 
Other current asset s and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities , included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and 
Other long-term liabilities . Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observa ble market data such asinterest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit, governme
nt debt securities and money market funds.Derivatives are valued using observa
ble data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rateswaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded deriv
atives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financialinstruments and valuation techniques ca
n be found in Note  4 — Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities 
— Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of lo ng-lived tangible andintangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intan
gible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, themajority of assets acquired and liabilities ass
umed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevantaccounting guidance. In determinin
g the fair value of these items, management makes several assumptions as discussed in the Impairments sectionabove.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
— We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures.
We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives a
nd hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in thebalance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value exce
pt where derivatives qualify and are designated as "normal purchase/normal sale"transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recog
nized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related toderivative instruments are recognized in the same category as that generate
d by the underlying asset or liability. See Note 5 — DerivativeInstruments and Hedging Activities 
included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification. 120

The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based onthe exposure being hedged. Thes
e hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivativethat is highly effective and is designated an
d qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of theexposure being hedged. The C
ompany has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and isdesignated as and qualifi
es as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings asthe hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recog
nized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formaldocumentation of the hedge and effectiveness testin
g in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.The fair value measurement accounting standard provi
des additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the pricethat would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liabi
lity in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date,or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consid
er and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fairvalue calculation. These factors includ
e nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reportingentity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Company's interest rate swaps, which are typically assoc
iated withnon-recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary leve
l rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on theCompany's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initia
l asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuationmodels that utilize observable market inputs.
As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates relate
d to derivative accounting could result in material changes toour financial statements under different conditions or utiliz
ing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we makeestimates concerning nonperformance, volatiliti
es, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and ourcounterparty's), and future exchange rates. Refer to Note  
4 — Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally d
etermined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based onobservable market inputs including i
nterest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most ofits financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt's). In some cases, where market
data is not readily available, manag
ement uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine afinancial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, the publ
ished curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract andmanagement must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there is l
imited forward curve data with respect to foreignexchange contracts, beyond the traded points the Compa
ny utilizes the purchasing power parity approach to construct the remaining portion of theforward curve using relative inflation rates. Addition
ally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financialinstitutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency sw
aps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid orask price and therefore are not considered observabl
e market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptionscould have a material effect on the calculated fair value.
Regulatory Assets 
— Management continually assesses wheth er the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factorssuch as applicable regulatory cha
nges, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potentialderegulation legislati
on. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operatingincome.
Consolidation 
— The Company has recently entered into several transactions w hereby the Company sells an interest in its controlledsubsidiaries and/or equity method investments. In connecti
on with each transaction, the Company must determine whether the sale of the interestimpacts the Company's consolidation co
nclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest modelor the voting model. In determining which consoli
dation model applies to the transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how theentity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equ
ity holders, as a group,have the characteristics of a controlling financial i
nterest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.If the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determinin
g whether the Company must consolidatethe entity is whether the Company, including its related p
arties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined tohave power and benefits, the entity will be cons
olidated by AES.121

Alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AESshareholders have substantive particip
ating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rightsrequires significant judgment since the rights provi
ded under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting thecompensation of management responsibl
e for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, establishing operating and capital decisions ofthe entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of bus
iness. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to asprotective rights) then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting i
nterest shall consolidate its investee.Significant judgment is required to determine w
hether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affectthe evaluation of control. While both represent an approv
al or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the rightrelates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans 
— Effective January 1, 2016 the Company applied a d isaggregated discount rate approach fordetermining service cost and interest cost for its defined benefit pensio
n plans and post-retirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. Refer to Note 1 —General and Summary of Significant Accounting P

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Overview Regarding Market Risks 
— Our businesses are exposed to and proactively manag e market risk. Our primary market risk exposureis to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal and enviro
nmental credits. In addition, our businesses are also exposed tolower electricity prices due to increased competition, inc
luding from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entryand lower variable costs. We operate in multiple cou
ntries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiarylevel and between our functiona
l currency, the U.S. Dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest ratefluctuations due to our issuance of debt and related fin
ancial instruments.The disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upo
n a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided inSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sectio
n 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall apply to the disclosures contained in thisItem 7A. For further information regarding market risk, see Item 1A.— 
Risk Factors , Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuatesignificantly due to fluctuations in currency excha
nge rates experienced at our foreign operations , Our businesses may incur substantial costs andliabilities and be expos
ed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect onour financial performance, 
and We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates of this 2016 
Form 10-K. Commodity Price Risk 
— Although we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuels and environmental credits, some of our generation business
es operate under short-term sales or under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposureon some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs. In our utility businesses, we may be expos
ed to commodity price movementsdepending on our excess or shortfall of generati
on relative to load obligations and sharing or pass-through mechanisms. These businesses subjectour operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels and environme
ntal credits in competitive markets. We employ risk managementstrategies to hedge our financial performance aga
inst the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these strategiescan involve the use of physical and fina
ncial commodity contracts, futures, swaps and options. At our generation businesses for 2017-2019, 75% to80% of our variable margin is hedged aga
inst changes in commodity prices. At our utility businesses for 2017-2019, 85% to 90% of our variablemargin is insulated from changes in commodity prices.
The portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreeme
nts or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectlymatched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When he
dging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract salesthat lock in the spread per MWh between variable costs and the price at whic
h the electricity can be sold.AES businesses will see cha
nges in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2017, we project pretax earningsexposure on a 10% move in commodity prices would be a
pproximately $15 million for U.S. power (DPL), $5 million for natural gas, $5 million for oiland $10 million for coal. 
Our estimates exclude correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a dec line in oil or natural gas prices can beaccompanied by
122

a decline in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure occurs with lower oil, lower natural gas,and higher coal prices. Exposures at indiv
idual businesses will change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity tochanges in commodity prices generally incre
ases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses.Commodity prices affect our businesses differently dependi
ng on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot powerprices, contract indexation provisions and ge
neration costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas, oil andcoal. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain b
usinesses and be a cost to others.Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these
factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/d
emand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition, bidding strategies andregulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational flex
ibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance, certain power plants may limitdownside exposure by reducin
g dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume soldunder contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weath
er and economic conditions resulting in a higher or lower volume of sales in spotmarkets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology ca
n affect the generation output available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting powerprices.
In the US SBU, the generation businesses are larg
ely contracted but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are not perfectly indexed tothe business drivers. IPL primarily generates energy to meet its retail customer demand howev
er it opportunistically sells surplus economic energyinto wholesale markets at market prices. Additionally, at DPL, competitive retai
l markets permit our customers to select alternative energy suppliersor elect to remain in aggregated customer pools for which energy is sup
plied by third party suppliers through a competitive auction process. DPLparticipates in these auctions held by other util
ities and sells the remainder of its economic energy into the wholesale market. Given that natural gas-fired generators generally get energy prices for many markets, higher natural gas prices ten
d to expand our coal fixed margins. Our non-contractedgeneration margins are impacted by many factors includin
g the growth in natural gas-fired generation plants, new energy supply from renewablesources, and increasing energy efficiency.
In the Andes SBU, our business in Chile o
wns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contract sales inboth. In the central region, the contract sales generally cover the efficient generati
on from our coal-fired and hydroelectric assets. Any residual spotprice risk will primarily be driven by the amount of hydrologic
al inflows. In the case of low hydroelectric generation, spot price exposure is capped bythe ability to dispatch our natural gas/diesel ass
ets the price of which depends on fuel pricing at the time required. There is a small amount of coalgeneration in the northern region that is not covered by the portfoli
o of contract sales and therefore subject to spot price risk. In both regions,generators with oil or oil-linked fuel ge
nerally set power prices. In Colombia, we operate under a short-term sales strategy and have commodityexposure to unhedged volumes. Beca
use we own hydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel.In the Brazil SBU, the hydroelectric generating facility is covere
d by contract sales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk ismitigated through a regulated sharing mecha
nism across all hydroelectric generators in the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanismmay not be sufficient to cover the business' contract position, and therefore it may have to purchase po
wer at spot prices driven by the cost ofthermal generation.
In the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on u
nhedged volumes. Panama is highly contracted under a portfolio of fixedvolume contract sales. To the extent hydrological inflows are gre
ater than or less than the contract sales volume, the business will be sensitive tochanges in spot power prices which may be drive
n by oil prices in some time periods. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas-fired assetscontracted under a portfolio of contract sales and a coal-fired asset contracted with a sin
gle contract, and both contract and spot prices may movewith commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do not al
ways match our generation availability and our assets may be sellers of spot pricesin excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations.
In the Europe SBU, our Kilroot facility operates on a short-term sales strategy. To the extent that sales are unhedge
d, the commodity risk atour Kilroot business is to the clean dark spread, which is the d
ifference between electricity price and our coal-based variable dispatch cost includingemissions. Natural gas-fired generators set power prices for many periods, so high
er natural gas prices generally expand margins and higher coal oremissions prices reduce them. Similarly, increased win
d generators displaces higher cost generation, reducing Kilroot's margins, and vice versa.In the Asia SBU, our Masinloc business is a coal-fired ge
neration facility which hedges its output under a portfolio of contract sales that areindexed to fuel prices, with generation in exc
ess of contract volume or shortfalls123

of generation relative to contract volumes settled in the spot market. Low oil prices may be a driver of margin compression since oil affects spotpower sale prices sold in the spot market. Our Mong Duong business h
as minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it has no merchant exposureand fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
— In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign op erations risksthat arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key compon
ent of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreignsubsidiaries and affiliates utiliz
e currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar ("USD"). Additionally, certain of ourforeign subsidiaries and affiliates h
ave entered into monetary obligations in the USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Wehave varying degrees of exposure to changes i
n the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine Peso, British Pound,Brazilian Real, Chilea
n Peso, Colombian Peso, Dominican Peso, Euro, Indian Rupee, Kazakhstan Tenge, Mexican Peso and Philippine Peso.These subsidiaries and affiliates h
ave attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust tochanges in foreign exchange rates. We also use forei
gn currency forwards, swaps and options, where possible, to manage our risk related to certainforeign currency fluctuations.
AES enters into cash flow hedges to protect economic valu
e of the business and minimize impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AESportfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is als
o designed to reduce forward looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due tovariation of timing and amount between cash distrib
ution and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on arealized basis which could resu
lt in greater volatility in earnings. The largest foreign exchange risks over a 12-month forward-looking period stemfrom the following currencies: Brazilian Real, Euro, Co
lombian Peso, British Pound, and Kazakhstan Tenge. As of December 31, 2016 , assuming a 10% USD appreciation, cash distributio
ns attributable to foreign subsidiaries exposed to movement in the exchange rate of the Brazilian Real andEuro each is projected to be reduced by $5 milli
on. Colombian Peso, Kazakhstan Tenge and British Pound - less than $5 million for 2017. Thesenumbers have been produced by app
lying a one-time 10% USD appreciation to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2017 coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to the currenci
es listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. Thenumbers presented above are net of any transactional ga
ins/losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed orexisting hedges are unwoun
d. Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in furthermodification. The sensitivities presented do n
ot capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.The foreign exchange sensitivities i
ncluded above have been calculated based on the underlying cash distribution exposures. This is differentthan the prior period’s disclosure, which was b
ased on earnings, as a result of a change in AES’ foreign exchange hedging strategy in 2016. Thetable below provides a comparison of the earn
ings based sensitivity approached used in the 2015 Form 10-K for both FY2016 and FY2017. 
Earnings Exposure  
2017   2016 ARS
—   5 BRL
10   5 COP
5   5 EUR
—   5 KZT
5   5 Interest Rate Risks 
— We are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixe d-ratedebt, as well as interest rate swap, cap, floor and option agreements.
Decisions on the fixed-floating debt mix are made to be cons
istent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending onwhether a plant's capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflati
on, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations byarranging fixed-rate or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particul
arly for non-recourse financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap and flooragreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financi
ng. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recoursefinancings at our businesses.
As of 
December 31, 2016 , the portfolio's pretax earnings exposure for 2017 to a one time 100-basis-point increase in interest rates for our Argentine Peso, Brazilian Rea
l, Colombian Peso, Euro, Kazakhstani Tenge and USD denominated debt would be approximately $25 million oninterest expense for the debt denominated in these currenci
es. These amounts do not take into account the historical correlation between theseinterest rates.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PU
BLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of The AES Corporati
on:We have audited the accompanying cons
olidated balance sheets of The AES Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the relatedconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensiv
e income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2016. Our audits also included the fin
ancial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements andschedules are the responsibility of the Compa
ny’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements andschedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the stand
ards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Thosestandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reaso
nable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of materialmisstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evid
ence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An auditalso includes assessing the acco
unting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financialstatement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reason
able basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all materia
l respects, the consolidated financial position of The AESCorporation at December 31, 2016 and 201
5, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod ended December 31, 2016, in co
nformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financialstatement schedules, when considered in rel
ation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects theinformation set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated fin
ancial statements, the Company changed its requirements for reporting discontinued operationsas a result of the adoption of the amendments to the FASB Accounting Stan
dards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No.2014-08, “Reporting Discontinue
d Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,” effective July 1, 2014. Also, the Companychanged its classification of debt issuanc

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014 
1 
. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe AES Corporation is a holdin
g company (the "Parent Company") that through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, "AES" or "theCompany") operates a geographically d
iversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, given this holdingcompany structure, the liabilities of the individua
l operating entities are non-recourse to the parent and are isolated to the operating entities. Most ofour operating entities are structured as limited liabil
ity entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardlessof whether a subsidiary is consolidated u
nder a voting or variable interest model.PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
— The Consolidated Financi al Statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporationand its subsidiaries, which are the entities that it controls. Furthermore, variable interest entiti
es ("VIEs") in which the Company has a variableinterest have been consolidated w
hen the Company is the primary beneficiary and thus controls the VIE. Intercompany transactions and balancesare eliminated in consolidati
on. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, areaccounted for using the equity method of accounting.
DP&L, our utility in Ohio, has undivided i
nterests in five generation facilities and numerous transmission facilities. These undivided interests injointly-owned facilities are accou
nted for on a pro-rata basis in our consolidated financial statements. Certain expenses, primarily fuel costs for thegenerating units, are allocated to the joint ow
ners based on their energy usage. The remaining expenses, investments in fuel inventory, plantmaterials and operating supplies a
nd capital additions are allocated to the joint owners in accordance with their respective ownership interests. SeeNote 
3 — Property, Plant and Equipment for additional details. USE OF ESTIMATES 
— The preparation of these consolidated fina ncial statements in conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires the Company to make estimates and assumptio
ns that affect reported amounts ofassets and liabilities and disc
losures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reportedamounts of revenue and expenses during the rep
orting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates andassumptions include: the carrying amount and estimated us
eful lives of long-lived assets; asset retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuatio
n allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets;the estimation of regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financ
ial instruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a businesscombination; the measurement of noncontrolling i
nterest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value ("HLBV") method for certain renewablegeneration partnerships; the determination of wheth
er a sale of noncontrolling interests is considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate (asopposed to an equity transaction); pension l
iabilities; environmental liabilities; and potential litigation claims and settlements.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
— Effective July 1, 2014, the Company prospectively adopted Acc ounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.2014-08, 
Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) an d Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting discontinued Operations andDisclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity 
, which significantly changed the prior acco unting guidance on discontinued operations. UnderASU No. 2014-08, only those disposa
ls of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or a held-for-sale business that will have)a major effect on an entity's operations and financial resu
lts are reported as discontinued operations. Amongst other changes: equity methodinvestments that were previously scoped-out of the discontinu
ed operations accounting guidance are now included in the scope; a business canmeet the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale upon acquis
ition and be reported in discontinued operations; and components where an entityretains significant continuing inv
olvement or where operations and cash flows will not be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of a disposaltransaction can meet the definition of discontinue
d operations. Additionally, where summarized amounts are presented on the face of the financialstatements, reconciliations of those amounts to major classes of line items are also require
d. ASU No. 2014-08 requires additional disclosures forindividually material compon
ents that do not meet the definition of discontinued operations. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08 we had classifiedcertain business as discontinued o
perations that would not meet the criteria under the current standard. See Note 23 — Dispositions for further information.
Prior to July 1, 2014, a discontinued operation w
as a component of the Company that either had been disposed of or was classified as held-for-sale and where the Company did not expect to have sig
nificant cash flows from or significant continuing involvement with the component as ofone year after its disposal or sale. A component
131

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014was comprised of operations and cash flows that could b
e clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest ofthe Company.
Prior period amounts in the statement of operations are retrospectively revised to reflect the busin
esses determined to be discontinuedoperations. The cash flows of businesses that are determined to be d
iscontinued operations or held-for-sale are included within the relevantcategories within operating, investin
g and financing activities. The aggregate amount of cash flows is offset by the net increase or decrease in cashof discontinued and held-for-sale bus
inesses, which is presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.When an operation is classified as hel
d-for-sale, the Company recognizes any impairment expense on the entire operation, which will includean amount allocable to noncontrol
ling interests, at the level of the held-for-sale operation and/or at a parent entity as applicable. However, any gainor loss on the completion of a disposal transaction is fully a
llocated to AES and to its noncontrolling interests at a parent entity level, given that theoperational level nonco
ntrolling interests have been removed with deconsolidation of the disposed entity. Assets and liabilities of held-for-salebusinesses are classified as current when they are exp
ected to be disposed of within twelve months.RECLASSIFICATIONS 
— To comply with newly adopted accountin g standards, certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financialstatements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Deferred financin
g costs were reclassified from the Other current assets and 
Other noncurrent assets lines to the current and noncurrent Non-recourse debt lines, respectively, in the Consolidate d Balance Sheet for theyear ended December 31, 2015. Additio
nally, amounts relating to capitalized software were reclassified from Electric generation, distribution assets and other 
line to Other intangible assets, net of amortization line on the Consolidated B alance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2015. Seefurther detail in the new accounting pronou
ncements discussion.FAIR VALUE 
— Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an ass et or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypotheticaltransaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company app
lies the fair value measurement accountingguidance to financial assets and l
iabilities in determining the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in theConsolidated Balance Sheet line
 items Short-term investments and Other assets (noncurrent) ; derivative assets, included in Other current assets and 
Other assets (noncurrent) ; and, derivati ve liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long-term liabilities . The Company applies the fair value measurement gu
idance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or in conjunction withthe measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss o
n an asset group or goodwill under the accounting guidance forthe impairment of long-lived assets or goodwill.
The Company makes assumptions about what market participants wo
uld assume in valuing an asset or liability based on the best informationavailable. These factors include no
nperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk of the subsidiary (for liabilities)and of the counterparty (for assets). The Company is prohibited from including transaction costs an
d any adjustments for blockage factors indetermining fair value. The principal or most advantag
eous market is considered from the perspective of the subsidiary owning the asset or with theliability.
Fair value is based on observable market prices wh
ere available. Where they are not available, specific valuation models and techniques areapplied dependi
ng on what is being fair valued. These models and techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use ofunobservable inputs. The process invo
lves varying levels of management judgment, the degree of which is dependent on price transparency andcomplexity. An asset's or liability's level with
in the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement,where Level 1 is the highest and Leve
l 3 is the lowest. The three levels are defined as follows:•
Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible by the Company for identical assets or liabilities. Active markets are those inwhich transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency an
d volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.•
Level 2 — pricing inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 which are based on observable market data, that are directly orindirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liabil
ity. These include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities,quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, adjusted quoted market prices, inputs from observable d
atasuch as interest rate and yield curves, volatilities or default rates observab
le at commonly quoted intervals or inputs derived from observablemarket data by correlation or other means.
132

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014•
Level 3 — pricing inputs that are unobservable from objective sources. Unobservable inputs are only used to the extent observable inputs aren'tavailable. These inputs maintai
n the concept of an exit price from the perspective of a market participant and reflect assumptions of other marketparticipants. The Company considers all market participa
nt assumptions that are available without unreasonable cost and effort. These are giventhe lowest priority and are generally used in i
nternally developed methodologies to generate management's best estimate of the fair value whenno observable market data is available.
Any transfers between all levels within the fair valu
e hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
— The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, de posits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equ
ivalents. The carrying amounts of such balancesapproximate fair value.
RESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERV
ICE RESERVES — These include cash balances w hich are restricted as to withdrawal or usage bythe subsidiary that owns the cash. The nature of restrictions includes restrictions impos
ed by financing agreements such as security deposits keptas collateral, debt service reserves, maintenance reserves, contractual terms and others, as well as restrictions impos
ed by agreements related tothe sales of businesses or long-term PPAs.
INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
— The Company's marketable investments are primarily unsecured d ebentures, certificatesof deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Short-term investments consist of marketable equity securities an
d debt securitieswith original maturities in excess of three months with remaining maturities of less tha
n one year.Marketable debt securities that the Company has both the positive i
ntent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity andare carried at amortized cost. Other marketable securities that the Company does not intend to hold to maturity are classified as ava
ilable-for-sale ortrading and are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale i
nvestments are fair valued at the end of each reporting period where the unrealized gains orlosses are reflected in AOCL, a separate component of equity.
Investments classified as trading are fair valued at the end of each reporting p
eriod through the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Interest and dividends on investments are reported in 
interest income and other income , respectively. Gains and losses on sales of investments are determined using the specific identificati
on method.ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABL
E AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — Accounts and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the col
lectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as specific evaluation ofcollectability, historical collectio
n experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence of the collectability, and recordsan allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated unco
llectible amount as appropriate. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accountsreceivable either under contractual terms or where charging i
nterest is a customary business practice. In such cases, interest income is recognizedon an accrual basis. When the collection of such interest is not reaso
nably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individualaccounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no l
onger deemed collectible.INVENTORY 
— Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and spare p arts and supplies used tomaintain power generation and d
istribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is the sum of the purchase price andincidental expenditures an
d charges incurred to bring the inventory to its existing condition or location. Costs of inventory are valued primarily usingthe average cost method. Generally, the carrying amount of fuel inventory is reduced to market value if the market value of inve
ntory has declinedand it is expected that the carrying amount of inventory, in its use in the ordinary course of busin
ess, will not be recovered through revenue earnedfrom the generation of power. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typica
lly reduced only in instances where the items are consideredobsolete.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
— Long-lived assets include property, plant an d equipment, assets under capital leases and intangible assets subjectto amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets).
Property, plant and equipment 
— Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of renew als andimprovements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are cap
italized.133

, AND 2014Construction progress payments, engineering costs, insura
nce costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction inprogress are capitalized during the construction p
eriod, provided the completion of the project is deemed probable, or expensed at the time theCompany determines that development of a particular project is no l
onger probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to ongoingrisks related to successful completion, including thos
e related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting andcontract compliance. Construction-in-progress balanc
es are transferred to electric generation and distribution assets when an asset group is readyfor its intended use. Government subsidies, liquidate
d damages recovered for construction delays and income tax credits are recorded as areduction to property, plant and equipment and reflected i
n cash flows from investing activities.Depreciation, after consideration of salvage va
lue and asset retirement obligations, is computed primarily using the straight-line method overthe estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or compo
nent basis. Maintenance and repairs are charged toexpense as incurred. Capital spare parts, includ
ing rotable spare parts, are included in electric generation and distribution assets. If the spare part isconsidered a component, it is depreciated over its useful l
ife after the part is placed in service. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset,the part is depreciated over the composite useful life even wh
en being held as a spare part.The Company's Brazilian subsi
diaries, which include both generation and distribution companies, operate under concession contracts. Certainestimates are utilized to determine depreciation exp
ense for the Brazilian subsidiaries, including the useful lives of the property, plant and equipmentand the amounts to be recovered at the end of the concession contract. The amounts to be recovered u
nder these concession contracts are basedon estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual amou
nts recovered may differ from those estimates. These concession contracts are not withinthe scope of ASC 853— 
Service Concession Arrangements . Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization 
— Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized ov er their useful lives which range from 3  – 50  years.The Company accounts for purchased emission al
lowances as intangible assets and records an expense when utilized or sold. Granted emissionallowances are valued at zero.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
— When circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a h eld-for-use asset groupmay not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential imp
airment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows expectedto result from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necess
itate a recoverability evaluation mayinclude, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regu
latory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increasedcompetition due to additional cap
acity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likelythan not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previous
ly estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds theundiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use, an impairment expens
e is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of theasset group exceeds its fair value. The impairment expense can
not exceed the carrying amount of the long-lived assets (but subject to the carryingamount not being reduced below fair val
ue for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort). For regulatedassets where recovery through approved rates is probable, an imp
airment expense could be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset. Forother regulated assets and for non-regulated assets, impairment is recogn
ized as an expense. When long-lived assets meet the criteria to beclassified as held-for-sale and the carrying amount of the disp
osal group exceeds its fair value less costs to sell, an impairment expense isrecognized for the excess up to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets; if the fair value of the disp
osal group subsequently exceeds thecarrying amount while the disposal grou
p is still held-for-sale, any impairment expense previously recognized will be reversed up to the lower of theprior expense or the subsequent excess.
SERVICE CONCESSION ASSETS 
— Service concession assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, in accordance w ith ASC853. Service concession assets represent the cost of all infrastructure to be transferred to the public-sector entity grantors at the end of the
concession. These costs primarily represent construction progress payments, eng
ineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costsdirectly relating to construction of the service concession infrastructure. Government subsidi
es, liquidated damages recovered for constructiondelays and income tax credits are recorded as a reduction to Service C
oncession Assets. Service concession assets are amortized and recognizedin earnings as a cost of goods sold as infrastructure construction revenue is reco
gnized. Services provided under concession arrangements arerecognized on a straight line basis.

DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS 
— Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of lo ng-term debt are deferred and presented as a directreduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing perio
d using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costsrelated to a line-of-credit are deferred and presented as an asset and amortize
d over the related financing period. Make-whole payments inconnection with early debt retirements are classified as cash flo
ws used in financing activities.EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
— Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise si gnificant influence, but notcontrol, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting a
nd reported in Investments in and advances to affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company perio
dically assesses if there is an indication that the fair value of an equity method investment is less than itscarrying amount. When an indicator exists, any excess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recogn
ized as impairment expensewhen the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary an
d included in Other non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between the carrying amount and our un
derlying equity in the net assets of the investee are accounted for as if the investee were aconsolidated subsidiary, except that the portion that represe
nts equity method goodwill is not reviewed for impairment like consolidated goodwill.Upon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair valu
e of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the AES share of the amortizationof the basis difference between each fair value an
d the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of theinvestee. The amortization of the basis difference is recognize
d in our net equity in earnings of affiliates over the life of the asset or liability.The Company discontinues the app
lication of the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero and the Company is not otherwisecommitted to provide further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the app
lication of the equity method accounting to the extentthat net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded.
GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
— The Company evaluates goodwi ll and indefinite-lived intangible assets forimpairment on an annual basis and w
henever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annualimpairment testing date is October first.
Goodwill 
— The Company evaluates goodwi ll impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an SBU (i.e. an operating segment as defined inthe segment reporting accounting guida
nce), or a component (i.e., one level below an operating segment). In determining its reporting units, theCompany starts with its management reporting structure. Operating segments are identified and the
n analyzed to identify components which makeup these operating segments. Two or more components are combined i
nto a single reporting unit if they are economically similar. Assets andliabilities are allocated to a reportin
g unit if the assets will be employed by or a liability relates to the operations of the reporting unit or would beconsidered by a market participant in determining its fair value. Good
will resulting from an acquisition is assigned to the reporting units that areexpected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Generally, each A
ES business with a goodwill balance constitutes a reporting unit as theyare not reported to segment management together with other businesses an
d are not similar to other businesses in a segment.Goodwill is evaluated for impairment either und
er the qualitative assessment option or the two-step test. If the Company qualitativelydetermines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is
unnecessary. Otherwise, goodwill is eval
uated for impairment using the two-step test, where the carrying amount of a reporting unit is compared toits fair value in Step 1; if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, Step 2 is unnecess
ary. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fairvalue, this could indicate potentia
l impairment and Step 2 of the goodwill evaluation process is required to determine if goodwill is impaired and tomeasure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. When Step 2 is necessary, the fair value of indivi
dual assets and liabilities isdetermined using valuations (whic
h in some cases may be based in part on third party valuation reports) or other observable sources of fair value,as appropriate. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its impli
ed fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss up to the carryingamount of the
 goodwill.Most of the Company's reporting units are not publicly traded. Therefore, the Company estimates the fair val
ue of its reporting units usinginternal budgets and forecasts, adjusted for any market participants' assumpti
ons and discounted at the rate of return required by a marketparticipant. The Company generally cons
iders both market and income-based approaches to determine a range of fair value, but typically concludesthat the value derived using an income-bas
ed approach is more representative of fair value due to the lack of direct market comparables. The135

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014Company utilizes market data, when availab
le, to corroborate and determine the reasonableness of the fair value derived from the income-baseddiscounted cash flow analysis.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
— The Company's indefinite-lived i ntangible assets primarily include land-use rights and water rights. Theseare tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever eve
nts or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. If thecarrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair valu
e, the excess is recognized as impairment expense. When deemed appropriate, theCompany uses the qualitative assessment optio
n under the accounting guidance on goodwill and intangible assets to determine whether theexistence of events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an intangi
ble asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality ofevents and circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that an intang
ible asset is impaired, no further action is taken.The accounting guidance prov
ides the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any intangible asset in any period and proceed directly toperforming the quantitative impairment test.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER
 ACCRUED LIABILITIES — Accounts payable consists of amounts due to trade creditors related to the Company's core business operations. Thes
e payables include amounts owed to vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased forresale, fuel, maintenance, inventory and other raw materials. Other accrued liab
ilities include items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legalcontingencies and employe
e-related costs including payroll, benefits and related taxes.REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
— The Company records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaki ng processthat are not recognized under GAAP for non-regulated entiti
es. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred due tothe future recovery in customer rates being probable. Generally, returns earned on regu
latory assets are reflected on the Consolidated Statement ofOperations within 
Interest Income . Regulatory liabilities genera lly represent obligations to make refunds to customers. Management continuallyassesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regu
latory of liabilities are probable of future payment by consideringfactors such as applicable regulatory chang
es, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potentialderegulation legislati
on. If future recovery of costs previously deferred ceases to be probable, the related regulatory assets are written off andrecognized in income from continuing op
erations.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS 
— The Company recognizes in its Consoli dated Balance Sheets an asset or liabilityreflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement pla
ns with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL,except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utiliti
es that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligationsthrough future rates. All plan assets are recorded at fair value. AES follows the measureme
nt date provisions of the accounting guidance, whichrequire a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obl
igations for all defined benefit plans.Effective January 1, 2016, the Company applied a d
isaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for itsdefined benefit pension pl
ans and postretirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. This approach is consistent with the requirements of ASC 715—Compensation—Retirement Benefits 
and is considered to be more precise compared to the aggreg ated single rate discount approach, which hashistorically been used in the U.S. and U.K., becaus
e it is more consistent with the philosophy of a full yield curve valuation. The disaggregated rateapproach can be applied o
nly in countries with a sufficiently robust yield curve. For countries other than the U.S. and U.K., the Company willcontinue to apply a local government bo
nd yield approach.The change in discount rate approach i
n the U.S. and U.K. did not have an impact on the measurement of the benefit obligations as ofDecember 31, 2015. The 2016 service costs and interest costs inclu
ded in Note 14 — Benefit Plans reflect the change in estimate described above. The impact of the change in approach on service costs for the U.S. and U.K. plans in 2

— Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognize d for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between thefinancial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and lia
bilities,136

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014and their respective income tax bases. The Company establ
ishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of adeferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax pos
itions are evaluated under a more likely than not recognition threshold andmeasurement analysis before they are recognized for financi
al statement reporting.Uncertain tax positions have been class
ified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company'spolicy for interest and penalties related to income tax expos
ures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for incometaxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
— The Company records the fair value of the liability for a legal ob ligation to retire an asset in theperiod in which the obligati
on is incurred. When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing thecarrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liab
ility is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated overthe useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, the Comp
any eliminates the liability and, based on the actual cost to retire, mayincur a gain or loss.
NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
— Noncontrolling interests are classified as a sep arate component of equity in the Consolidated BalanceSheets and Consolidated Stateme
nts of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrollinginterests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and compre
hensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations andConsolidated Statements of Changes i
n Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained isaccounted for as an equity transaction between the control
ling and noncontrolling interests (unless the transaction qualifies as a sale of in-substancereal estate). Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrollin
g interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' basis has been reduced to zero.Although, in general, the noncontrol
ling ownership interest in earnings is calculated based on ownership percentage, certain of the Company'sbusinesses are subject to profit-sharing arrangements. These agre
ements exist for certain renewable generation partnerships to designate differentallocations of value among investors, where the a
llocations change in form or percentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, theCompany uses the HLBV method when it is a reason
able approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. HLBV uses a balance sheet approach,which measures the Company's share of income or loss by calcu
lating the change in the amount of net worth the partners are legally able to claimbased on a hypothetical liqu
idation of the entity at the beginning of a reporting period compared to the end of that period.Equity securities with redemption features that are not solely withi
n the control of the issuer are classified outside of permanent equity. Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. Su
bsequent measurement and classification vary depending on whether the instrument isprobable of becoming redeemabl
e.  Where the equity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable subsequent allocation of income anddividends is classified in perman
ent equity. For those securities where it is probable that the instrument will become redeemable or that are currentlyredeemable, AES recognizes chan
ges in the fair value at each accounting period against retained earnings subject to the floor of the initial fairvalue. Further, the allocation of income and divid
ends, as well as the adjustment to fair value, is classified outside permanent equity. Amounts thatare mandatory redeemable are classified as a lia
bility.FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
— A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environme nt in which thebusiness operates and is general
ly the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functionalcurrency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabiliti
es into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at theend of the fiscal period. Translation adjustments arisin
g from the translation of the balance sheet of such subsidiaries are included in AOCL. Therevenue and expense accounts of such subs
idiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevailedduring the period. Gains and losses on intercomp
any foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature and which the Company does notintend to settle in the foreseeable future, are also recognize
d in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactionsdenominated in a currency other than the functional currency are i
ncluded in determining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translationadjustments are reclassified from AOCL to net income only when realiz
ed upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of theinvestment in a foreign entity. The accumulated adjustments are incl
uded in carrying amounts in impairment assessments where the Company hascommitted to a plan that will cause the accumulated adjustments to be reclass
ified to earnings.137

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014REVENUE RECOGNITION 
— Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated i n the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue fromthe sale of energy is recognized in the period d
uring which the sale occurs. The calculation of revenue earned but not yet billed is based on thenumber of days not billed in the month, the estimated amount of energy deliv
ered during those days and the estimated average price per customerclass for that month. Differences between actual and estimated unbil
led revenue are usually immaterial. The Company has businesses where it sellsand purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. In those instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a n
et hourly basis becausethe transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. Revenue from generati
on businesses is classified as non-regulated and is recognized based uponoutput delivered and capacity provid
ed, at rates as specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates. Certain of the Company PPAs meetthe definition of an operating lease or conta
in similar arrangements. Typically, minimum lease payments from such PPAs are recognized as revenueon a straight-line basis over the lease term whereas conting
ent rentals are recognized when earned. Revenue is recorded net of any taxesassessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authoriti
es.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
— The Company grants share-based compensation i n the form of stock options, restricted stock units, andperformance stock units. The expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the eq
uity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on astraight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Compa
ny uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model toestimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees.
GENERAL AND ADMINIS
TRATIVE EXPENSES — General and administrative expenses incl ude corporate and other expenses related tocorporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive manageme
nt, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, which are notdirectly allocable to our business segme
nts. Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as generaland administrative expenses.
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
— Under the accounting standards for derivatives and he dging, the Company recognizes allcontracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal p
urchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets orliabilities in the Consol
idated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. See the Company's fair value policy and Note 4— Fair Value 
for additional discussion regardi ng the determination of the fair value. The PPAs and fuel supply agreements entered into by the Company areevaluated to determine if they meet the definition of a derivative or contai
n embedded derivatives, either of which require separate valuation andaccounting. To be a derivative under the accou
nting standards for derivatives and hedging, an agreement would need to have a notional and anunderlying, require little or no initial n
et investment and could be net settled. Generally, these agreements do not meet the definition of a derivative,often due to the inability to be net settled. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the markets for the commodities to be del
ivered under theseagreements to determine if facts and circumstances have changed such that the agreeme
nts could then be net settled and meet the definition of aderivative.
Derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity derivatives. The
Company enters into various derivative transactions in ord
er to hedge its exposure to certain market risks, primarily interest rate, foreign currencyand commodity price risks. Regarding interest rate risk, the Company and our subsid
iaries generally utilize variable rate debt financing forconstruction projects and operations so interest rate swap, lock, cap, and floor agre
ements are entered into to manage interest rate risk byeffectively fixing or limiting the interest rate exposure on the underlyi
ng financing and are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Regardingforeign currency risk, we are exposed to it as a result of our investments in foreign subsidiaries a
nd affiliates that may be impacted by significantfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates so foreign currency o
ptions and forwards are utilized, where deemed appropriate, to manage the riskrelated to these fluctuations. Cross-currency swaps are utilized in certain i
nstances to manage the risk related to certain foreign currencies and theassociated impact on interest and loan princi
pal payments. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have entered into contracts which containembedded foreign currency derivatives as a result of the contracts being d
enominated in a currency other than the functional or local currency of theparties to the contract. Regarding commodity price risk, we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuel and
environmental credits. Although we primarily cons
ist of businesses with long-term contracts or retail sales concessions (which provide ourdistribution businesses with a franchise to serve a spec
ific geographic region), a portion of our current and expected future revenues are derivedfrom businesses without significant long-term purchase or sales co
ntracts. We use an overall hedging strategy, not just derivatives, to hedge ourfinancial performance against the effects of fluctuations in commodity prices.

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014The accounting standards for derivatives and he
dging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based onthe exposure being hedged. The C
ompany only has cash flow hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective,designated and qualifi
es as a cash flow hedge are deferred in AOCL and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions affect earnings.Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earn
ings immediately. For all designated and qualifying hedges, the Company maintains formal documentationof the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordanc
e with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. If AES determines that thederivative is no longer highly effective as a he
dge, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. For cash flow hedges of forecastedtransactions, AES estimates the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions and evaluates the pro
bability of the occurrence and timing of suchtransactions. Changes in conditions or the occurrenc
e of unforeseen events could require discontinuance of hedge accounting or could affect thetiming of the reclassification of gains or losses on cash flow he
dges from AOCL into earnings.While derivative transactions are not entered into for trading purpos
es, some contracts are either not eligible or not designated for hedgeaccounting. Changes in the fair value of deriv
atives not designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.Regardless of when gains or losses on d
erivatives (including all those where the fair value measurement is classified as Level 3) are recognized inearnings, they are generally classified as fol
lows: interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transactiongains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regul
ated revenue or non-regulated cost of sales for commodity and other derivatives.However, gains and losses on interest rate and cross-currency derivativ
es are classified as foreign currency transaction gains and losses if theyoffset the remeasurement of the foreign currency-denominated debt being he
dged by the cross-currency swaps. If the underlying hedged item isconstruction debt, the effective portion of the realized swap payment related to cap
italized interest is deferred in AOCL, then reclassified to cost ofsales to offset depreciation expense over the useful life of the assoc
iated asset. Any foreign currency remeasurement effects in earnings of theforeign currency denominated debt is offset by a reclassification from AOCL. Cash flows aris
ing from derivatives are included in the ConsolidatedStatements of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the un
derlying risk being economically hedged and the lack of significantfinancing elements, except that cash flows on desig
nated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate interest during construction are classified as aninvesting activity.
The Company has elected not to offset net derivative positions i
n the financial statements. Accordingly, the Company does not offset suchderivative positions against the fair value of amou
nts (or amounts that approximate fair value) recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (areceivable) or the obligation to return cash collatera
l (a payable) under master netting arrangements.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30)
These standards simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debtissuance costs related to a tranche of debt be presented on 
the balance sheet as adirect deduction from the carrying amount of that debt, consistent with debt
 discounts.Debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit can still be presented as an asset and
subsequently amortized over the term of the line-of-credit, regardless of whether there
are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the s
tandard.Transition method: retrospective.
January 1,2016
Deferred financing costs of $24 millionpreviously classified within other

, AND 20142016-09, Compensation 
—  Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting
The standard simplifies the following aspects of accounting for share-based paymentsawards: accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the
statement of cash flows, forfeitures, statutory tax
 withholding requirements,classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification of employee
taxes paid on statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-
withholding purposes. Transition method: The recording of excess tax benefits and tax
deficiencies arising from vesting or settlement will be applied prospectively. The
elimination of the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before they are
recognized will be adopted on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative
adjustment to the opening balance sheet.
January 1,2017.
The primary effect of adoption will bethe recognition of excess tax benefits
in our provision for income taxes in the
period when the awards vest or are
settled, rather than in paid-in-capital in
the period when the excess tax
benefits are realized. Upon adoption,
the change will result in a decrease of
approximately $30 million to net
deferred tax liabilities, offset by an
increase to retained earnings. We will
continue to estimate the number of
awards that are expected to vest in our
determination of the related periodic
compensation cost.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)
The standard creates Topic 842, Leases, which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. It introduces a lessee model that brings substantially all leases onto the balance sheet
while retaining most of the principles of the existing lessor model in U.S. GAAP and
aligning many of those principles with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. Transition method: modified retrospective approach with certain practical
expedients.
January 1,2019. Early
adoption is
permitted.
The Company is currently evaluatingthe impact of adopting the standard on
its consolidated financial statements.
The Company intends to adopt the
standard as of January 1, 2019.

Revenue from Contracts with

See discussion of the ASU below:January 1, 2018. Earlier
application is
permitted only
as of January
1, 2017.
The Company will adopt the standardon January 1, 2018; see below for the
evaluation of the impact of its adoption
on the consolidated financial
statements.
ASU 2014-09 and its subseque
nt corresponding updates provides the principles an entity must apply to measure and recognize revenue. Thecore principle is that an entity shall recognize reve
nue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflectsthe consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled i
n exchange for those goods or services. Amendments to the standard were issued thatprovide further clarification of the principle and to provid
e certain transition expedients. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognitionguidance in GAAP, includi
ng the guidance on recognizing other income upon the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets (including in-substance realestate).
The standard requires retrospective applicatio
n and allows either a full retrospective adoption in which all of the periods are presented underthe new standard or a modified retrospective approach in w
hich the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance is recognized at the date ofinitial application. We are currently working tow
ards adopting the standard using the full retrospective method. However, the company will continueto assess this conclusion which is depe
ndent on the final impact to the financial statements.In 2016, the company established a cross-functional imp
lementation team and is in the process of evaluating changes to our businessprocesses, systems and controls to support recognition and disclos
ure under the new standard. At this time, we do not expect any significant impacton our financial systems as a result of the implementation of the new revenue reco
gnition standard.Given the complexity and diversity of our non-regulated arrang
ements, the Company is assessing the standard on a contract by contract basisand has completed more than half of the total expected effort. Through this assessment, the Company has i
dentified certain key issues that we arecontinuing to evaluate in order to complete our assessme
nt of the full population of contracts and be able to assess the overall impact to thefinancial statements. These issues include: the ap
plication of the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of a performanceobligation, when variabl
e quantities would be considered variable consideration versus an option to acquire additional goods and services, how tomeasure progress toward completion for a performance obligatio
n that is a bundle and application of the standard to contracts that are under thescope of Service Concession Arrangements (Topic 8
53). We are continuing to work with various non-authoritative industry groups, and monitoringthe FASB and Transition Resource Group (TRG) activity, as we finalize our acco
unting policy on these and other industry specific interpretativeissues which is expected in 2017.

. FAIR VALUEThe fair value of current financial assets and liabi
lities, debt service reserves and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts.The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liab
ilities have been determined using available market information. By virtue of theseamounts being estimates and based on hyp
othetical transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/orestimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair valu
e amounts.Valuation Techniques 
— The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value ofassets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach an
d (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevantinformation generated from market transactions involving identic
al or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuationtechniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amou
nt. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return onthose future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently b
e required to replace an asset. The Company measures itsinvestments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Add
itionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certainnonfinancial assets and lia
bilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, plantand equipment), goodwill an
d intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In general, the Company determinesthe fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach a
nd the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurring measurementsof nonfinancial assets and liab
ilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often themost representative of fair value.
Investments 
— The Company's investments measured at fair value general ly consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securitiesare either measured at fair value using quoted market prices, which are cons
idered Level 1 measurements in the fair value hierarchy, or measuredat fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets, which are co
nsidered Level 2 measurements in the fair valuehierarchy. Debt securities primarily consist of unsecured debe
ntures, certificates of deposit and government debt securities held by our Braziliansubsidiaries. Returns and pricing on thes
e instruments are generally indexed to the CDI rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair valuebased on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets and are cons
idered Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy.Derivatives 
— Any Level 1 derivative instruments are exchange-traded commod ity futures for which the pricing is observable in active markets,and as such, these are not expected to transfer to other levels. There have been no transfers betwee
n Level 1 and Level 2.For all derivatives, with the exception of any classified as L
evel 1, the income approach is used, which consists of forecasting future cash flowsbased on contractual notional amou
nts and applicable and available market data as of the valuation date. The most common market data inputsused in the income approach inclu
de volatilities, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR and EURIBOR), foreign exchange ratesand commodity prices. Forward rates with the same tenor as the derivative instrument being valu
ed are generally obtained from published sources,with these forward rates being assessed quarterly at a portfolio-leve
l for reasonableness versus comparable published information provided fromanother source. When significant inputs are not observab
le, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regressionanalysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available i
n the market.143

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014For derivatives for which there is a standard industry valuation mode
l, the Company uses a third-party derivative accounting and valuationservice provider that uses a standard model and observab
le inputs to estimate the fair value. For these derivatives, the Company performsanalytical procedures and makes compariso
ns to other third-party information in order to assess the reasonableness of the fair value. Forderivatives for which there is not a standard industry valuation mod
el (such as PPAs and fuel supply agreements that are derivatives or includeembedded derivatives), the Company has created intern
al valuation models to estimate the fair value, using observable data to the extent available.At each quarter-end, the models for the commodity and foreign currency-based derivatives are g
enerally prepared and reviewed by employees whoglobally manage the respective commodity an
d foreign currency risks and are analytically reviewed independent of those employees.Those cash flows are then discounted usin
g the relevant spot benchmark interest rate (such as LIBOR or EURIBOR). The Company thenmakes a credit valuation adjustment ("CVA") by further discounting the cash flows for nonp
erformance or credit risk based on the observable orestimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the ten
or of the respective derivative instrument. The CVA for potentialfuture scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset is bas
ed on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt spreads, asavailable. The CVA for potential future scenari
os in which the derivative is a liability is based on the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's currentdebt spread. In the absence of readily obtainab
le credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated credit rating (based onapplying a standard industry model to historica
l financial information and then considering other relevant information) and spreads of comparablyrated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivativ
e instruments are analyzed individually and are subject tounique risk exposures.
The Company's methodology to fair value its derivativ
es is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the publishedforward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the
curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable i
nputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices.Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exc
hange contracts, beyond the traded points the Company utilizes thepurchasing power parity approach to construct the remainin
g portion of the forward curve using relative inflation rates. In addition, in certaininstances, there may not be market or market-corroborated data readily available, requirin
g the use of unobservable inputs. Similarly, in certaininstances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable requ
iring us to utilize proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.The fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based o
n the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption is consideredsignificant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are class
ified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs is significant.When the use of unobservable inputs is insi
gnificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 aredetermined as of the end of the reporting period and result from changes in si
gnificance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA.Debt 
— Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated b ased on quoted marketprices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated differently based up
on the type of loan. In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debtis a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated usin
g quoted market prices or discounted cash flow ("DCF")analyses. In the DCF analysis, the discount rate is based on the cred
it rating of the individual debt instruments, if available, or the credit rating of thesubsidiary. If the subsidiary's credit rating is not availabl
e, a synthetic credit rating is determined using certain key metrics, including cash flow ratiosand interest coverage, as well as other industry-specific factors. For subsidiaries l
ocated outside the U.S., in the event that the country rating islower than the credit rating previously determined, the country rating is use
d for purposes of the DCF analysis. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation d
ate. The fair value was determined using available market information as of December 31, 2016 
. The Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subs equent to December 31, 2016 . Nonrecurring Measurements 
— For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is determined using valuationmodels based on the principles of DCF. The inc
ome approach is most often used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangible assets, equitymethod investments, goodwill, and intang
ible assets. The Company uses its internally developed DCF valuation models as the primary means todetermine nonrecurring fair value measurements though oth
er valuation approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accountingguidance are also considere
d. Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management inthe valuation process. A few examples of input assumptions to such va
luations include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industrydemand, inflation, exchange rates and
144

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014power and commodity prices. Whenever possible, the Compa
ny attempts to obtain market observable data to develop input assumptions. Wherethe use of market observable data is limited or not available for certain in
put assumptions, the Company develops its own estimates using a varietyof techniques such as regression analysis a
nd extrapolations.For nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions inv
olving the sale of identical or similar assetsare considered. The use of this approach is limited bec
ause it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. Thisapproach is used in impairment evaluati
ons of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under theincome approach.
For nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approac
h, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. Under thisapproach, the depreciated replacement cost of assets is derived by first estimating the current replac
ement cost of assets and then applying theremaining useful life percentages to such costs. Further adjustments for economic an
d functional obsolescence are made to the depreciatedreplacement cost. This approach involves a consi
derable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-livedtangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is als
o used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.Fair Value Considerations 
— In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observab le market data inputs, liquidity of theinstrument, the credit risk of the counterparty and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions an
d criteria usedto assess these factors are:
Sources of market assumptions 
— The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value, where market data is not readily availa
ble, management uses comparable market sources and empiricalevidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.
Market liquidity 
— The Company evaluates market liquidity base d on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, istraded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market
bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of tradin
g volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume and themarket has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the q
uantity of assets traded without significantlyaffecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining w
hether a market is active or inactive is the presence ofgovernment or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-base
d price when entering into a transaction.Nonperformance risk 
— Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfille d and affects the value at which a liability istransferred or an asset is sold. Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited to, the Company or its counterparty's credit and settleme
nt risk.Nonperformance risk adjustments are dependent on cred
it spreads, letters of credit, collateral, other arrangements available and the nature ofmaster netting arrangements. The Company and its subsidiaries are p
arties to various interest rate swaps and options; foreign currency options andforwards; and derivatives and embedded deriv
atives, which subject the Company to nonperformance risk. The financial and physical instrumentsheld at the subsidiary level are genera
lly non-recourse to the Parent Company.Nonperformance risk on the investments held by the Company is inc
orporated in the fair value derived from quoted market data to mark theinvestments to fair value.
Recurring Measurements 
— The following table presents, by level with in the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1— General and Summary of Significant Accounting Polici
es, the Company's financial assets and li abilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as ofthe dates indicated (in millions). For the Company's inv
estments in marketable debt and equity securities, the security classes presented aredetermined based on the nature and risk of the security and are consiste

Collection of the principal and i nterest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties including, but notlimited to, the operation of power plants which gen
erate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing andamount of collections, and economic conditi
ons in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentinegovernment, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receiv
ables. The Company accrues interest on these receivables once therecognition criteria have been met. The Company's co
llection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, but areinherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could d
iffer from these estimates.FONINVEMEM Agreements
As a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered i
nto three agreements with the Argentine government, referred to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion of their accounts receivable into a fund for financi
ng the construction of combined cycleand gas-fired plants. These receivables accrue i
nterest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related plant begins operations. In addition, AES Argentina rece
ives an ownership interest in these newly built plants once the receivables have been fully repaid.FONINVEMEM I and II 
— The receivables under the first two FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plantscommenced operations in 2010. In assessing the co
llectability of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers how timelythe collections have historically be
en made in accordance with the agreements.FONINVEMEM III — 
The receivables related to the third FONINVEMEM Agreement have be en actively collected since the related plantscommenced operations in 2016. In assessing the co
llectability of the receivables under this agreement, the Company also considers how timely thecollections have historically be
en made in accordance with the agreements.The FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated i
n Argentine pesos, but indexed to U.S. dollars, which represents a foreign currencyderivative. As of 
December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM financing receivables that were exclu
ded from the table above had a fair value of $255 million and $292 million , respectively. Other Agreements
In 2013, Resolution No. 95/2013 ("Resol
ution 95") which developed a new energy regulatory framework that applies to all generationcompanies with certain exceptions became effective. The n
ew regulatory framework reimburses fixed and variable costs plus a margin that willdepend on the technology an
d fuel used to generate the electricity and the installed capacity of each plant.In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Argentine government passed a resolution to contrib
ute outstanding Resolution 95 receivables into a trustwhereby AES Argentina has committed to install ad
ditional capacity into the system. CAMMESA will finance the investment utilizing the outstandingreceivables as a guarantee.
On July 10, 2015, the Argentine government passed Res
olution No. 482/2015 ("Resolution 482") which updated the prices of Resolution529/2014 retroactively to February 1, 2015, and created a new trust calle
d FONINVEMEM 2015-2018 in order to invest in new generation plants.AES Argentina and certain Termoandes u
nits will receive compensation under this program.150

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company performed the annual go odwill impairment test at its DP&L reporting unit andrecognized a goodwill imp
airment expense of  $317 million . The reporting unit failed Step 1 as its fair value was less than its carrying amount, which was primarily due to a decrease in forecasted dark spreads that were driven by d
ecreases in projected forward power prices, and lower thanexpected revenues from a

, AND 2014new CP product. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined u
nder the income approach using a discounted cash flow valuation model. Thesignificant assumptions include
d within the discounted cash flow valuation model were forward commodity price curves, the amount of non-bypassable charges from the pending ES
P, expected revenues from the new CP product, and planned environmental expenditures. In Step 2,goodwill was determined to have a
n implied negative fair value after the hypothetical purchase price allocation under the accounting guidance forbusiness combinations; therefore, a full impairment of the remaining g
oodwill balance of $317 million was recognized. DP&L is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

nts are limited to subsidiary activity and vary among the subsidiaries. These covenants may include, but are notlimited to, maintenance of certain reserves and financial ratios, minimum lev
els of working capital and limitations on incurring additionalindebtedness.
As of December 31, 
2016 and 2015 , approximately $535 million and $513 million , respectively, of restricted cash was maintained in accordance with certain covenants of the non-recourse de
bt agreements, and these amounts were included within Restricted cash and Debt servicereserves and other deposits 
in the accompanying Con solidated Balance Sheets.Various lender and governmental prov
isions restrict the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries to transfer their net assets to the ParentCompany. Such restricted net assets of subsidiaries amounted to approx
imately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016 . The following table summarizes the Company
's subsidiary non-recourse debt in default (in millions) as of December 31, 2016 . Due to the defaults, these amounts are included in the current portion of non-reco

December 31, 2016 , none of the defaults are payment defaults. All of the subsidiary non-recourse d efaults were triggered by failure tocomply with other covenants and/or conditions such as (but not limite
d to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or othermilestones in an allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements conta
ined in the non-recourse debtdocuments of 
the applicable subsidiary.In the event that there is a default, bankruptcy or maturity acceleration at a subsidiary or group of subsidiari
es that meets the applicabledefinition of materiality under the corporate debt agreements of The AE
S Corporation, there could be a cross-default to the Company's recoursedebt. Materiality is defined in the Parent's senior secured cred
it facility as having provided 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cashdistributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of 
December 31, 2016 , none of the defaults listed above individually or in the aggreg
ate result in or are at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company. In the event theParent Company is not in compliance with the fina
ncial covenants of its senior secured revolving credit facility, restricted payments will be limited toregular quarterly shareholder divide
nds at the then-prevailing rate. Payment defaults and bankruptcy defaults would preclude the making of anyrestricted payments.

In connection with certain project financings, acq uisitions and dispositions, power purchases and otheragreements, the Parent Company has expressly undertaken l
imited obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will beterminated upon the occurrence of future events. In the normal course of business, the Parent Company has e
ntered into various agreements,mainly guarantees and letters of credit, to provide financial or performance ass
urance to third parties on behalf of AES businesses. Theseagreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthi
ness otherwise achieved by a business on a stand-alone basis, therebyfacilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accompl
ish their intended business purposes. Most of the contingent obligations relate to futureperformance commitments which the Company or its businesses expect to fulfill withi
n the normal course of business. The expiration dates of theseguarantees vary from less than 
one year to more than 18 years.The following table summarizes the Parent Compa
ny's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 . Amounts presented in the following table represent the Parent Compa

 Excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.As of December 31, 
2016 , the Parent Company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase relatedequipment that were not included in the letters of credit discusse
d above. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 
0.2% to 2.5%  per annum on the outstanding amounts of letters of credit. Environmental — 
The Company periodically revie ws its obligations as they relate to compliance with environmental laws, including siterestoration and remediation. As of 
December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company had re cognized liabilities of $12 million and $10 million , respectively, for projected environmental remediation costs. Due to the uncertainti
es associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, futurecosts of compliance or remediation could be hig
her or lower than the amount currently accrued. Moreover, where no liability has been recognized, itis reasonably possible that the Company may be req
uired to incur remediation costs or make expenditures in amounts that could be material butcould not be estimated as of 
December 31, 2016 . In aggregate, the Company estimates that the range of potential losses related to enviro nmentalmatters, where estimable, to be up to 
$19 million . The amounts considered reasonably possi ble do not include amounts accrued as discussedabove.
Litigation — 
The Company is involved in certain cla ims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company accruesfor litigation and claims when it is probabl
e that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company hasevaluated claims in accordance with the acc
ounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and,accordingly, has recorded aggregate li
abilities for all claims of approximately $179 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . These amounts are reported on the Consolidated Bal
ance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities . A significant portion of these accrued liabilities relate to employment, non-i
ncome tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions (principally Brazil). Certain of theCompany's subsidiaries, princip
ally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seekunspecified monetary damages, injunctiv
e relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defendthemselves in all of these proceedings. There can b
e no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and futureclaims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such cla
ims as they arise.Where no accrued liability has been reco
gnized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company andcould require the Company to pay damages or make expe
nditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2016 
. The material contingencies where a loss is reason ably possible primarily include claims under financing agreements; disputes with offtakers,suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged vi
olation of monopoly laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; andregulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates that the range of potential losses, where estimabl
e, related to these reasonably possiblematerial contingencies to be between 
$1.5 billion and $1.8 billion . The amounts considered reasonably possi ble do not include amounts accrued, asdiscussed above. These material conting
encies do not include income tax-related contingencies which are considered part of our uncertain taxpositions.
Regulatory 
— During 2013, the Company recognized a reg ulatory liability of $269 million for a contingency related to an administrative ruling which required Eletropaulo to refund customers' amo
unts related to the regulatory asset base. In 2014, Eletropaulo started refunding customers aspart of the tariff. In January 2015, ANEEL updated the tariff to exclude any further customer refunds. On June 30, 2015, ANEEL incl
uded in the tariffreset the reimbursement to Eletropaulo of these amounts previously refunde
d to customers to begin in July 2015. During 2015, as a result offavorable events, management reassessed the conting
ency and determined that it no longer meets the recognition criteria under ASC 450 —Contingencies 
. Management believes that it is now only reasonab ly possible that Eletropaulo will have to refund these amounts to customers.Accordingly, the Company reversed the

ency of $161 million in 2015, which increased Regulated Revenue by $97 million and reduced Interest Expense 
by $64 million . Amounts related to this case are now included as part of our reasonably p ossible contingent range mentioned in thepreceding paragraph.

. BENEFIT PLANSDefined Contribution Plan 
— The Company sponsors four defined contribution plans ("the Plans"). Two are for U.S. non-union employees, of which 
one is for employees of the Parent Company and certain U.S. SBU businesses and one is for DPL employees. One plan includes both union and non-union employees at IPL. 
One defined contribution plan is for unio n employees at DPL. The Plans are qualified under section 401 of theInternal Revenue Code. All U.S. employe
es of the Company are eligible to participate in the appropriate Plan except for those employees who arecovered by a collective bargainin
g agreement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is considered an eligible employeeunder a Plan. The Plans provide matchin
g contributions in AES common stock or cash, other contributions at the discretion of the CompensationCommittee of the Board of Directors in AES common stock or cash and discretionary tax deferred contributions from the participants. Particip
antsare fully vested in their own contributions and the Comp
any's matching contributions. Participants vest in other company contributions ratably over afive 
-year period ending on the fifth anniversary of their hire date. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company's contributions to the defined contribution plans were a
pproximately $15 million , and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , contributions were $18 million and 
$22 million per year, respectively. Defined Benefit Plans — 
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries hav e defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respectiveemployees. Pension benefits are base
d on years of credited service, age of the participant and average earnings. Of the 33 active defined benefitplans as of 
December 31, 2016 , 5 are at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries  . The following table reconcil

 Includes an inflation factor that is used to calculate future periodic benefit cost, but is not used to calculate the benefit obligation.The Company establishes its estimated long-term return on plan ass
ets considering various factors, which include the targeted asset allocationpercentages, historic returns and expected future returns.
The measurement of pension obligatio
ns, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. These assumptions include estimatesof the present value of projected future pension payments to all pl
an participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future eventssuch as salary increases and demographic ex
perience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.The assumptions used in develop
ing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates; salary growth; retirement rates;inflation; expected return on plan assets; and mortality rates.
The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortize
d over future periods and, therefore,generally affect the Company's recognized ex
pense in such future periods.Effective January 1, 2016, the Company applied a d
isaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for itsdefined benefit pension pl
ans and postretirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. Refer to Note 1 — General and Summary of Significant AccountingPolicies 
for further information relating to this change in estimate. Sensitivity of the Company's pension fund
ed status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return onplan assets assumptions is shown belo
w. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2016 . They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multip
le factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individualsensitivities shown. The funded status as of December 31, 
2016 is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 2016 is affected by the December 31, 
2015 assumptions. The impact on pension expens e from a one percentage point change in these assumptions isshown in the following

. SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATIONThe segment reporting structure uses the Company's organizatio
nal structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages thebusinesses internally and is orga
nized by geographic regions which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business. Themanagement reporting structure is organized by 
six SBUs led by our President and Chief Executive Officer: US, Andes, Brazil, MCAC, Europe, andAsia SBUs. Using the accounting gu
idance on segment reporting, the Company determined that it has six operating and six reportable segmentscorresponding to its SBUs.
Corporate and O
ther — Corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated w ith the operations of our six reportable segments areincluded in "Corporate and Other." Also includ
ed are certain intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminated inconsolidation.
The Company uses Adjusted PTC as its primary segment performance measure. Adj
usted PTC, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by theCompany as pretax income from continuing operations attributa
ble to AES excluding (1) unrealized gains or losses related to derivativetransactions, (2) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (3) gains or losses d
ue to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (4) lossesdue to impairments, and (5) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The Company has concluded that Adj
usted PTC best reflects the underlyingbusiness performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure consi
dered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financialperformance of its segments. Additionally, given its large number of busi
nesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is amore transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which business
es have the greatest impact on the Company's results.    Revenue and Adjusted PTC are pres
ented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of intercompany transactions with othersegments except for interest, charges for certain management fees, and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applic
able. All intra-segmentactivity has been eliminated within the se
gment. Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results.The following tables present financ

. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONSTOCK OPTIONS 
— AES grants options to purchase shares of common stock under stock option plans to empl oyees and non-employeedirectors. Under the terms of the plans, the Company may issue options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price eq
ual to100% 
of the market price at the date the option is granted. Stock options are generally granted b ased upon a percentage of an employee's basesalary. Stock options issued in 
2015 and 2014 have a three -year vesting schedule and vest in one-third increments over the three -year period. The stock options have a contractual term of 
ten years. The Company did not issue stock options in 2016. At December 31, 2016 , approximately 16 million 
shares were remaining for award under the plans. In all circumstances, stock optio ns granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, orobligate AES, to settle the stock option in cash or other assets of AES.
The following table presents the wei

RESTRICTED STOCK
Restricted Stock Units 
— The Company issues restricted stock units ("RSUs") under its long-term compensation plan. The RS Us aregenerally granted based upo
n a percentage of the participant's base salary. The units have a three -year vesting schedule and vest in one-third increments over the 
three -year period. Units granted prior to 2011 are required to be held for an ad ditional two years before they can be convertedinto shares, and thus become transferable. There is no such requirement for units granted i
n 2011 and afterwards. In all circumstances, restrictedstock units granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or oblig
ate AES, to settle the restricted stock unit in cash or other assets of AES.For the years ended December 31, 
2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , RSUs issued had a grant date fair value equal to the clos ing price of theCompany's stock on the grant date. The Company does not disco
unt the grant date fair values to reflect any post-vesting restrictions. RSUs grantedto employees during the years ended Decemb
er 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 had grant date fair values per RSU of $9.42 , $12.03 and $14.60 , respectively.

umber of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimatedforfeiture rate, the Company expects to expense 
$16 million on a straight-line basis over a three year period related to RSUs granted during the year ended December 31,

  358  549  796 Performance Stock Units 
— In 2015 and 2014, the Company issued performance stock un its ("PSUs") to officers under its long-termcompensation plan. PSUs are restricted stock units of which 
50% of the units awarded include a market condition a nd the remaining 50% include a performance condition. Vesting will occur if the app
licable continued employment conditions are satisfied and (a) for the units subject to the marketcondition the total stockholder return on AES common stock exceeds the total stockh
older return of the Standard and Poor's 500 Utilities SectorIndex over the 
three -year measurement period beginning on Ja nuary 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of the third year and (b) forthe units subject to the performance condition if the Company's actua
l Adjusted EBITDA meets the performance target over the three -year measurement period beginning o
n January 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of the third year. The market and performanceconditions determine the vesting and fina
l share equivalent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of 0% to 200% , depending on the achievement. PSUs that included a market conditio
n granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 , and 2014 had a grant date fair value per PSU of 
$8.22 and $15.19 , respectively. In 2016, the Company issued PSUs to officers under its long-term compensatio
n plan. Vesting will occur if the Company achieves itsProportional Free Cash Flow target over the three-year performance period b
eginning on January 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 ofthe third year. The PSUs issued to officers in 2016 had a grant date fair value of 
$9.41 equal to the closing price of the Company's stock on the grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated at 
100% of the company's closing stock price. The company believ es that it's probable that theperformance condition will be met and wil
l continue to be evaluated throughout the performance period.In all circumstances, PSUs granted by AES do not entitle the hol
der the right, or obligate AES, to settle the restricted stock unit in cash or otherassets of AES.

Performance Cash Units 
- In 2016 , the Company issued Performance Cash Units ("PCUs") to its officers under its long-term compensation plan. The value of these units depends o
n the total stockholder return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholder return of theStandard and Poor's 500 Utilities S
ector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index and MSCI Emerging Market Index over a three -year measurement period beginning on Ja
nuary 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of the third year. Since PCUs are settled in cash, they qualify forliability accounting and p
eriodic measurement is required. As of December 31, 2016, each PCU is valued at $1.04 per unit. The Company expects to expense 
$7 million on a straight-line basis over a three year period (approximately $2 million per year) related to these PCUs. 18

 Characteristics of quotas are similar to common stock.Colon 
— During the year ended December 31, 2016 , our partner in Colon increased their ownership from 25% to 49.9% and made capital contributions of 
$106 million . Any subsequent adjustments to allocate earnin gs and dividends to our partner, or measure the investment at fairvalue, will be classified as temporary equity eac
h reporting period as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable.IPL 
— IPL had $60 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , which represented five series ofpreferred stock. The total annual dividend requireme
nts were approximately $3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Certain series of the preferred stock were redeemable solely at the option of the issuer at prices betwe
en $100 and $118 per share. Holders of the preferred stock are entitled to elect a majority of IPL's board of directors if IPL has not paid dividen
ds to its preferred stockholders for four consecutive quarters. Basedon the preferred stockholders' ability to elect a majority of IPL's board of directors in this circumstance, the redemptio
n of the preferred shares isconsidered to be not solely within the control of the issu
er and the preferred stock is considered temporary equity.DPL 
— DPL had $18 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , which represented three series of preferred stock issued by DP&L, a wholly-owned su
bsidiary of DPL. The DP&L preferred stock was redeemable at DP&L's option as determined by its boardof directors at per-share redemption prices between 
$101 and $103 per share, plus cumulative preferred dividends. In additi on, DP&L's AmendedArticles of Incorporation contained provisions that permitted preferred stockho
lders to elect members of the DP&L Board of Directors in the eventthat cumulative dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears in an aggre
gate amount equivalent to at least four full quarterly dividends. Based onthe preferred stockholders' ability to elect members of DP&L's board of directors in this circumstance, the redempti
on of the preferred shares wasconsidered to be not solely within the control of the issu
er and the preferred stock was considered temporary equity.In September 2016, it became probable that the preferred shares woul
d become redeemable. As such, the Company recorded an adjustmentof 
$5 million to retained earnings to adjust the preferred shares to their redemption valu e of $23 million . In October 2016, DP&L redeemed all of its preferred shares. Upon redemption, the preferred shares were no longer outstan
ding and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of DP&Lceased to exist.
IPALCO 
— In February 2015, CDPQ purchased 15% of AES US Investment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that owns 100% of IPALCO, for $247 million 
, with an option to invest an additional $349 million in IPALCO through 2016 in exchang e for a 17.65% equity stake. In April 2015, CDPQ invested an additional 
$214 million in IPALCO, which resulted in CDPQ's combine d direct and indirect interest in IPALCO of 24.90% . As a result of these transactions, 
$84 million in taxes and transaction costs were recognized as a net decreas e to equity. The Company also recognizedan increase to additional pai
d-in capital and a reduction to retained earnings of 377 million for the excess of the fair value of the shares over their book value. 
No gain or loss was recognized in net income as the transaction was not considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate.In March 2016, CDPQ exercised its remaining option by investi
ng $134 million in IPALCO, which resulted in CDPQ's combine d direct andindirect interest in IPALCO of 
30% . The Company also recognized an increas e to additional paid-in capital and a reduction to retained earnings of$84 million 
for the excess of the fair value of the shares over their book value. In June 2016, CDPQ contributed an a dditional $24 million to IPALCO, with no impact to the ownership structure of the investment. Any subsequent adjustments to all
ocate earnings and dividends to CDPQ will beclassified as NCI within permanent equity as it is not proba
ble that the shares will become redeemable.173

— During 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-l ived assets at Buffalo Gap I. Low wind production during 2016resulted in management lowering future expectati
ons of production and therefore future forecasted revenues. As such this was determined to be animpairment indicator. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset group w
as not recoverable. The Buffalo Gap I asset groupwas determined to have a fair value of 
$36 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recogn ized an asset impairment expenseof 
$77 million ( $23 million attributable to AES). Buffalo Gap I is reported in the US SBU reportable segment. DPL 
— During the second quarter of 2016, the Company tested the recoverabi lity of its long-lived generation assets at DPL. Uncertaintycreated by the Supreme Court of Ohio’s June 20, 2016 opin
ion regarding ESP 2, lower expectations of future revenue resulting from the most recentPJM capacity auction, and higher anticipate
d environmental compliance costs resulting from third party studies were collectively determined to be animpairment indicator for these assets. The Company performed a long-lived ass
et impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount ofKillen, a coal-fired generation facil
ity, and certain DPL peaking generation facilities were not recoverable. The Killen and DPL peaking generationasset groups were determined to have a fair value of 
$84 million and $5 million , respectively, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized a total asset impairment expense of 
$235 million . DPL is reported in the US SBU reportable segment. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-liv
ed coal-fired generation assets and one gas-fired peakingplant at DPL. Additional uncertainty arou

, AND 2014related to the Company’s ESP proceedin
gs, along with lower expected forward dark spreads and capacity prices, were collectively determined to bean impairment indicator for these assets. Market information indicating that there was a signific
ant decrease in the fair value of Zimmer and MiamiFort was determined to be an indicator of impairment for these assets. The lower forward dark spreads and cap
acity prices, along with the indicatorsat the other coal-fired facilities, collectively, resulted in an in
dicator of impairment for the Conesville asset group. For the gas-fired peaking plant,significant incremental capital expe
nditures relative to its fair value, and an impairment charge taken at this facility in Q2 2016, were collectivelydetermined to be impairment indicators for this asset. The Company performed a long-liv
ed asset impairment analysis for each of these assetgroups and determined that their carrying amounts were not recoverabl
e. The Stuart, Killen, Miami Fort, Zimmer, Conesville and the gas-firedpeaking plant asset groups were determine
d to have a fair value of  $57 million , $43 million , $36 million , $24 million ,  $1 million and $2 million , respectively, using the market approach for Miami Fort and Zimmer and the income approach for the remainin
g asset groups. As a result, theCompany recognized a total pre-tax asset impairment expense of  
$624 million . DPL is reported in the US SBU reportable segment. Buffalo Gap I
I — During 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-l ived assets at Buffalo Gap II. Impairment indicators wereidentified based on a decli
ne in forward power curves. The Company determined that the carrying amount was not recoverable. The Buffalo Gap IIasset group was determined to have a fair value of 
$92 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recogn ized an assetimpairment expense of 
$159 million ( $49 million attributable to AES). Buffalo Gap II is reported in the US SBU reportable segment. Kilroot 
— During 2015, the Company tested the recoverability of lon g-lived assets at Kilroot, a coal- and oil-fired plant in the U.K., when theregulator established lower capac
ity prices for the Irish Single Electricity Market. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the assetgroup was not recoverable. The Kilroot asset group was d
etermined to have a fair value of $70 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expens
e of $121 million . Kilroot is reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment. Buffalo Gap I
II — During 2015, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-l ived assets at Buffalo Gap III, a wind farm in Texas.Impairment indicators were identified based on a d
ecline in forward power curves coupled with the near term expiration of favorable contracted cashflows. The Company determined that the carrying amount was not recoverabl
e. The Buffalo Gap III asset group was determined to have a fair valueof 
$118 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recogn ized asset impairment expense of $116 million . Buffalo Gap  III isreported in the US SBU reportable segment.
U.K. Wind 
— During 2015, the Company decided to no l onger pursue two wind projects in the U.K. based on recent regulatory clarificationsspecific to these projects, resulting in a full impairment. Impairment indicators were also i
dentified at four other wind projects based on their currentdevelopment status and a reassessment of the likeliho
od that each project would be pursued given aviation concerns, regulatory changes,economic considerations and other factors. The Company d
etermined that the carrying amounts of each of these asset groups, which totaled $38 million 
, were not recoverable. In aggregate, the asset groups were determined to have a fair valu e of $1 million using the market approach and, as a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of 
$37 million . The U.K. Wind Projects are reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.
Ebute 
— During 2014, the Company identified imp airment indicators at Ebute in Nigeria, resulting from the continued lack of gas supply, theincreased likelihood of sel
ling the asset group before the end of its useful life, and indications about the potential proceeds that could be receivedfrom a future sale. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Comp
any recognized assetimpairment of 
$67 million , which represents the difference between the carrying amount of $103 million and fair value less cost to sell of $36 million . In November 2014, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Ebute. See Note 
23 — Dispositions for additional details. Prior to its sale, Ebute was reported in the Europe SBU reportabl
e segment.U.K. Wind (New
field) — During 2014, the Company tested the recoverability of lon g-lived assets at its Newfield wind development project inthe U.K. after their government refused to grant a permit necessary for the project to continue. The Company determined that the carrying amount of
the asset group was not recoverable. The Newfield ass
et group was determined to have no fair value using the income approach. As a result, theCompany recognized asset impairment expens

25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 2018 and future years. The impact of remeasuring deferred taxes to account for the enacted change in future app
licable income tax rates was recognized as discrete income tax expensein the first quarter of 2016, resulting in an increase of 
$26 million to consolidated income tax expense. 176

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014Deferred Income Taxes 
— Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial rep
orting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and (b) operating loss and tax creditcarryforwards. These items are stated at the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
As of December 31, 
2016 , the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $3.5 billion expiring in years 2021 to 2036. Approximately 
$88 million of the net operating loss carryforward related to stock option deductions wi ll be recognized inadditional paid-in cap
ital when realized. The Company also had federal general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $20 million expiring primarily from 2021 to 2036, and federal alternativ
e minimum tax credits of approximately $5 million that carry forward without expiration. The Company had state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 
2016 of approximately $9.1 billion expiring in years 2017 to 2036. As of December 31, 
2016 , the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3.1 billion that expire at various times beginning in 2017 a
nd some of which carry forward without expiration, and tax credits available in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $32 million , $22 million 
of which expire in 2021 and $8 million of which carryforward without expiration. Valuation allowances decreased 
$18 million during 2016 to $876 million at December 31, 2016 . This net decrease was primarily the result of valuation allowance rel
eases and foreign exchange gains at certain of our Brazil subsidiaries.Valuation allowances decreased 
$103 million during 2015 to $894 million at December 31, 2015 . This net decrease was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses and val
uation allowance releases at certain of our Brazil and Vietnam subsidiaries.The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets as shown b
elow will be realized when future taxableincome is generated through the reversal of existing taxab
le temporary differences and income that is expected to be generated by businesses thathave long-term contracts or a history of generating taxable income. The Company co
ntinues to monitor the utilization of its deferred tax asset for itsU.S. consolidated net operating loss carryforward. Althou
gh management believes it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will berealized through generation of sufficient taxab
le income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards, suchrealization is not assured.

U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded with respect to such earnings in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes.Should the earnings be remitted as divid
ends, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. As ofDecember 31, 
2016 , the cumulative amount of foreign un-remitted earnings upon whic h U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately$4 billion 
. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of any additional taxes which may be payab le on the undistributed earnings.Income from operations in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding
employment and capital investment. The Company's i
ncome tax benefits related to the tax status of these operations are estimated to be $20 million , 
$21 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The per share effect of these benefits after noncontrolling interests was

. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSBrazil Distribution — 
Due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016, manageme nt has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distributioncompanies in Brazil, AES Sul and E
letropaulo. The disposal of Sul was completed in October 2016. In December 2016, Eletropaulo underwent acorporate restructuring which is expected to, among other things, provide more liq
uidity of its shares. AES is continuing to pursue strategic optionsfor Eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce AES’ exposure to the Brazil
ian distribution business, including preparation for listingits shares into the Novo Mercado, which is a listing segment of the Brazili
an stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance.The Company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-o
wned subsidiary AES Sul in June 2016. We have reported the results ofoperations and financial pos
ition of AES Sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Uponmeeting the held-for-sale criteria, the Company recognized a
n after tax loss of $382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $783 million , offset by a tax benefit of 
$266 million related to the impairment of the Sul long lived assets and a tax ben efit of $135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in AES Sul. Prior to the impairment charge in the second q
uarter, the carrying value of the AES Sul asset group of $1.6 billion 
was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell. However, the impairment charge was l imited to the carrying value of the longlived assets of the AES Sul disposal grou
p.On 
October 31, 2016 , the Company completed the sale of AES Sul and receiv ed final proceeds less costs to sell of $484 million , excluding contingent consideration. Upon d
isposal of AES Sul, we incurred an additional after-tax loss on sale of $737 million . The cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was 
$1.1 billion . This includes the reclassification of approximately $1 billion of cumulative translation losses, resulting in a net reduction to the Company’s stockho
lders’ equity of $92 million . Sul’s pretax loss attributable to AES for the years ended 
December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 billion and $32 million , respectively. Sul’s pretax gain attributable to AES for the 
year ended December 31, 2014 was $133 million . Prior to its classification as discontinued operations, Sul was reported in the Brazil SBU reportable segment.
As discussed in Note 
1 — General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , effective July 1, 2014, the Company prospectively adopted ASU No. 2014-08. Disconti
nued operations prior to adoption of ASU No. 2014-08 include the results of Cameroon, Saurashtra and variousU.S. wind projects which were each sold in the first half of 2014.

al common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutiverestricted stock units, stock options and convertible securities. The effect of such potential common stock is computed usi

December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , all 15 million convertible debentures were omitted from the earnings per share calc ulation. The stockawards and convertible debentures w

. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESAES is a diversified power generatio
n and utility company organized into six market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of theCompany's principal markets in Note  
16 — Segment and Geographic Information . Within our six SBUs, we have two primary lines of business:Generation and Utilities. The Generation li
ne of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas,hydro, wind, solar and biomass. Our Utilities business is comprise
d of businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generatepower. In addition, the Company has operations i
n the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind and solar.Operating and Economic Risks 
— The Company operates in several develo ping economies where macroeconomic conditions are usuallymore volatile than developed eco
nomies. Deteriorating market conditions often expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cashflows due to, among other factors, adverse
182

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015
, AND 2014fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets. Addition
ally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards,which could impact our ability to finance growth pro
jects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has a below-investment graderating from Standard & Poor's of BB-. This could affect the Company's ability to finance n
ew and/or existing development projects at competitiveinterest rates. As of 
December 31, 2016 , the Company had $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. During 
2016 , 74% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. and a sig nificant portion of our international operations is conducted indeveloping countries. We continue to inv
est in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International operations,particularly the operation, financing an
d development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, withoutlimitation:
•
economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;•
inability to economically hedge energy prices;•
volatility in commodity prices;•
adverse changes in currency exchange rates;•
government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;•
unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;•
high inflation and monetary fluctuations;•
restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;•
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their commitments;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous tosubsidiaries of the Company and econ
omically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties aregovernments or private parties;
•
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;•
adverse changes in government tax policy;•
difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and•
potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.Any of these factors, individually or in combination w
ith others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. In additio
n, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected tocause significant volatility in our results of operatio
ns and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, politicalinstability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, an
d currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reducesthe predictability and enhances the u
ncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropri
ately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain reasonableincreases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operatio
ns or our ability to meet publiclyannounced projections or ana
lysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation ofregulatory provisions in jurisdictions w
here we operate, particularly our Utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review orapproval, could adversely affect our business, incl
uding, but not limited to:•
changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs;•
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs;•
adverse changes in tax law;•
changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;•
changes in the timing of tariff increases;•
other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or183

, AND 2014•
changes in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our businesses.Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which ca
n adversely affect our results of operations.Construction 
— As of December 31, 2016 , the Company has 531 MW under construction at Alto Maipo. Increased project costs, or delays inconstruction, could have an adverse impact on the Compa
ny.Foreign Currency Risks 
— AES operates businesses in many foreign cou ntries and such operations could be impacted by significantfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuatio
ns in currency exchange rate between U.S. Dollar and the following currencies couldcreate significant fluctuations to earnings and cas
h flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Dominican Republic peso, the Euro, the Chileanpeso, the Colombian pe
so, the Philippine peso and the Kazakhstan tenge.Concentrations 
— Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Compa ny does not have any significant concentration of customersor sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generatio
n businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majorityof, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no sin
gle customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 
2016 , 2015 or 2014 . The cash flows and results of operations of our businesses d
epend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of ourcustomers and suppliers to meet their obligations und
er PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAsand/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the Company wo
uld be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace suchcontracts at equally favorable terms.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls a
nd procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in thereports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amen
ded (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed,summarized and reported within the time periods specifie
d in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated andcommunicated to the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisio
ns regarding required disclosures.The Company carried out the evaluation requ
ired by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision and with the participation of ourmanagement, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure co
ntrols and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange ActRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upo
n this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2016 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establis
hing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined inRule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company
's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonableassurance regarding the reliabil
ity of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAPand includes those polici
es and procedures that:•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of theCompany;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withGAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are be
ing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directorsof the Company; and
•
provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on thefinancial statements are prevented or detected timely.
Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not exp
ect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A controlsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provi
de only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systemare met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluati
on of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls maybecome inadequate in future periods b
ecause of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresdeteriorates.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over fina
ncial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Interna
l Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of theTreadway Commission ("COSO") in 2013. Based on this assessment, management be
lieves that the Company maintained effective internal controlover financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2016 . The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financ
ial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an indepen
dent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.Changes in Internal Control Over Financia
l Reporting:There were no changes that occurred during the quarter end
ed December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

le for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for itsassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting i
ncluded in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controlover Financial Reporting. Our responsibi
lity is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the stand
ards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Thosestandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reaso
nable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reportingwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit inclu
ded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the riskthat a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the d
esign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, andperforming such other procedures as we considered nec
essary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for ouropinion.
A company’s internal control over financial rep
orting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purp
oses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Acompany’s internal control over financial rep
orting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactio
ns and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in acc
ordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and that receipts and expenditures of the company are bei
ng made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of thecompany; and (3) provide reasonable assuranc
e regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over fina
ncial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of anyevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inad
equate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, The AES Corporation mainta
ined, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,2016, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the stan
dards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidatedbalance sheets of The AES Corporation as of Dec
ember 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensiveincome, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the peri
od ended December 31, 2016 of The AES Corporation and ourreport dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqu
alified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

 be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed and (B) the Indemnifying Entity shall not be entitled to assumeand
 have control over such defense if such claim arises in connection with a criminal proceeding ( provided that  theIndemnifying

 Entity,  at  such  Indemnifying  Entity’s  sole  cost  and  expense)  or  if  the  Indemnified  Entity  shall  have  beenadvised
 by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying Entityin

 Party  of  all  applicable  Indemnified  Entities  without  any  cost  or  liability  of  any  nature  whatsoever  to  suchIndemnified Entities, (2) does not
 involve any finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law or admission of anywrongdoing

 or  condition  that  would  affect  the  future  conduct  of,  the  Indemnified  Entity  or  its  Affiliates  and  (B)  theIndemnifying
 Entity shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts of such settlement or compromise concurrently with theeffectiveness
 thereof, such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written consent of theIndemnified Entity. If,

elect to defend, settle or compromise such claim, (ii) is not entitled to assume and control the defense of such claim or(iii)
 fails to make such an election in writing, then such Indemnified Entity may, at its option, defend, settle or otherwisecompromise or pay such claim; 
provided that any  such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only withthe
 written  consent  of  the  Indemnifying  Entity,  which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned  ordelayed.

 any  such  claim,  then  the  Indemnified  Entity  shall  be  entitled  to  participate  in  such  defense  with  counselreasonably
 acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity at such Indemnified Entity’s sole cost and expense. In the event theIndemnifying

 actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity related to the related Losses (for purposes ofclarity,
 this Section  8.05(a) is  not intended to apply to the R&W Policy). If an Indemnified Entity shall have received thepayment
 required  by  this  Agreement  from  the  Indemnifying  Entity  in  respect  of  Losses  (including  any  MergerConsideration adjustment with
 respect to the circumstances giving rise to such payment under this Article VIII ) and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Losses, then such Indemnified Entity shall
promptly
 repay  to  the  Indemnifying  Entity  a  sum  equal  to  the  amount  of  such  insurance  proceeds  or  other  amountsactually
 received. Furthermore, the amount of any Losses that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (other thanLosses
 that  are subject  to Section  8.02(a)(i) (other  than respect to any Company Fundamental Representations andMajority
 Member  Representations)  and Section  8.03(a)(i) (other  than  respect  to  any  Parent  FundamentalRepresentations))

(b) 
     Subject to the rights of any Person providing insurance as contemplated by Section  8.05(a) , the
 Indemnifying Entity shall be subrogated to any right of action that the Indemnified Entity may have against any otherPerson with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.

 or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except in the case of willful
misconduct or fraud by such Party.(d)

 or  any  other  document  or  agreement  delivered  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  and  Losses  shall  notinclude
 any amounts that were included in the calculation of Working Capital. Without limiting the generality of the priorsentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant
or
 agreement that is subject to an indemnification obligation under this Article VIII ,  only one recovery of Losses shall beallowed,
 and  in  no  event  shall  there  be  any  indemnification  or  duplication  of  payments  or  recovery  under  differentprovisions of this Agreement arising out of the same facts, conditions or events.
