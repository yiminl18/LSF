PURCHASE, N.Y. - April 25, 2023  - PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for 
the first quarter 2023. 
“We are very pleased with our performance and business momentum as our categories and 
geographies remained resilient during the first quarter. Given our strong start to the year, we 
now expect our full-year 2023 organic revenue to increase 8 percent (previously 6 percent) and 
core constant currency EPS to increase 9 percent (previously 8 percent),” said Chairman and 
CEO Ramon Laguarta.
Laguarta continued, “Our results demonstrate that the investments we have made to become an 
even Faster, even Stronger, and even Better organization by Winning with pep+ are laying the 
foundation for durable and sustainable growth. We remain committed to our strategic agenda 
and will continue to invest in our people, brands, supply chain, go-to-market systems, and 
digitization initiatives to build competitive advantages and win in the marketplace.”

Guidance and Outlook
The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are 
included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity 
mark-to-market net impacts.  
For fiscal year 2023, the Company now expects to deliver 8 percent organic revenue growth (previously 6 
percent), and 9 percent core constant currency EPS growth (previously 8 percent).
Consistent with its previous guidance for 2023, the Company continues to expect:
•A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; and
•Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.7 billion, comprised of dividends of $6.7 
billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion.
In addition, the Company continues to expect an approximate 2-percentage-point foreign exchange 
translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market 
consensus rates.
This assumption and the guidance above imply 2023 core EPS of $7.27 (previously $7.20), a 7 percent 
increase (previously 6 percent) compared to 2022 core EPS of $6.79.
Prepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast
At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on April 25, 2023 , the Company will post prepared 
management remarks (in pdf format) of its first quarter 2023  results and business update, including its 
outlook for 2023 , at www.pepsico.com/investors . At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on April 25, 2023 , the 
Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts. Further

Non-GAAP Measures
In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency 
results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of 
our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for 
certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures  provides additional information to facilitate 
comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional 
transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures  allows investors to view our 
performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or 
that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which 
we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to 
restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment 
charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; 
charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to 
the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or 
exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets.  See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial 
measures included herein. 
Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a 
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial 
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.
Glossary
We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or 
comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:
Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including 
changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity inves tees.
Bottler case sales ( BCS ): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both 
PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.
Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.
Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates 
in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as 
appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, 
as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.
Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results.  For further 
information regarding these excluded items, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q1 2023  Form 10-Q and in “Item 7 – Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal 
year ended December 31, 2022 . For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:
Mark-to-market net impact
Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are 
subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating 
profit.  
Restructuring and impairment charges
Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through 
the end of 202 8 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include  merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures.  
Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.
A - 6
Gain associated with the Juice Transaction
We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction  in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.
Impairment and other charges/credits
We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges , brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as 
described below.
Russia-Ukraine conflict charges
In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges  related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.  
Brand portfolio impairment charges
We recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result 
of management’s  decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We 
also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.
Other impairment charges
We recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase 
in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 
2022.
Pension and retiree medical-related impact
Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding 
the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.
Tax benefit related to the IRS audit
We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of 
the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.
Tax expense related to the TCJ Act
Tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability 
under the TCJ Act.
Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting 
from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.
Organic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures  
and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53rd reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 
2022 financial results.  We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business 
because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability 
with the prior year. 
2023  guidance
Our 2023  organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and di vestitures , foreign exchange translation 
and the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2022 . Our 2023  core effective tax rate guidance and 2023  core constant currency EPS 
growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and 
impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023  core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the 
impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023  organic revenue growth to our 
full year projected 2023  reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023  impact of foreign exchange due 
to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or 
impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023  core effective tax rate 
to our full year projected 2023  reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023  core constant currency EPS growth to 
our full year projected 2023  reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023  impact of foreign exchange or the 
mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates  
and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
