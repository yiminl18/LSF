The King Acquisition
        On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company ("King"), by
purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"). W e made this acquisition because we believed that the addition of King's highly complementary
mobile business positioned us as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, and aligned us for future growth. The
aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion was funded with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the
Company . King's results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our consolidated financial statements.
Our Strategy and V ision
        Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and
services, as well as related media, that deliver engaging entertainment experiences on a year -round basis. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic
pillars: expanding audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.
        Expanding audience r each.     Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is at the core of our
business. W e endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play
games, which allow consumers to play games with no up-front cost but provide for player investment through sales of downloadable content or via
microtransactions; or (3) engagement in other types of media based on our franchises, such as esports and film and television content.
        Driving deep consumer engagement.     Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with
our franchises. W e design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a
game's release, delivering more value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.
        Pr oviding mor e opportunities for player investment.     Increasingly , our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs, and mobile
devices. This allows us to of fer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year -round basis. In addition to purchasing full
games or subscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental "in-game" content (including lar ger downloadable
content or smaller content, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit mar gins. Further , if
executed properly , additional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we
have begun to generate revenue through of fering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new forms of player
investment through esports, film and television, and consumer products. W e are in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.
        Our strategy is ultimately aimed at creating shareholder value and enhancing returns. W e strive to increase profitability , cash flows, and return on capital—
and to do so while keeping our company a great place to work for our employees.

Reportable Segments
        Based upon our or ganizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments as follows:
(i)    Activision Publishing, Inc.
        Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly
for the console platforms. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing
software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our
internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.
        Activision's key product franchise is Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms. Call of Duty has been the number one console
franchise globally for nine of the last 10 years, based on data from The NPD Group, GfK Chart-T rack, and GSD, and our internal estimates of dollar sales on
front line games.
        In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. ("Bungie") to publish games in the Destiny franchise. Ef fective December 31,
2018, Activision and Bungie, mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision
agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie's assumption of on-going customer obligations of
Activision. Going forward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise. As a result of the agreement to terminate
the relationship, the Company recognized net bookings, a key operating metric, of $20 million, GAAP revenues of $164 million, and GAAP operating income of
$91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
(ii)   Blizzar d Entertainment, Inc.
        Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly
for the PC platform. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by
licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service,
Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity , and the creation of user -
generated content. Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and
our Major League Gaming ("MLG") business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard
esports content.
        Blizzard's key product franchises include: W orld of W arcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game for the PC platform;
StarCraft®, a real-time strategy franchise for the PC platform; Diablo®, an action role-playing franchise for the PC and console platforms; Hearthstone®, an
online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; and Overwatch®, a team-based first-person shooter for the PC and console platforms.
(iii)  King Digital Entertainment
        King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily on mobile platforms, such as Google Inc.'s
("Google") Android and Apple Inc.'s ("Apple") iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King's
4
Table of Contents
games are free to play; however , players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency , and we continue to focus on in-game advertising
as a growing source of additional revenue.
        King's key product franchises, all of which are for the mobile and PC platforms, include: Candy Crush™, which features "match three" games; Farm
Heroes™, which also features "match three" games; and Bubble W itch™, which features "bubble shooter" games. King had two of the top 10 highest-grossing
titles in the U.S. mobile app stores for the last 21 quarters in a row , according to App Annie Intelligence and internal estimates for the Apple App Store and the
Google Play Store combined.
Other
        We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:
• the Activision Blizzard Studios ("Studios") business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of
globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in September 2018, released the third season of the animated TV series Skylanders ™
Academy  on Netflix; and 
• the Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and
sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.
Products
        We develop interactive entertainment content and services, principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games through retail
and digital distribution channels. Our products span various genres, including first-person shooter , action/adventure, role-playing, strategy , and "match three,"
among others. W e primarily of fer the following products and services:
• full-games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for console or PC; 
• downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game; 
• microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay , generally at
relatively low price points; and 
• subscriptions for players in our W orld of W arcraft franchise that provide for continual access to the game content.
        Providing additional opportunities for player investment outside of full-game purchases has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more
consistently recurring and year -round revenue model. In addition, if executed properly , it allows us to increase player engagement, as it provides more frequent
and incremental content for our players.
Product Development and Support
        We focus on developing enduring franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. W e build interactive entertainment
content with the potential for broad reach, sustainable engagement and year -round player investment. It is our experience that enduring franchises then serve as
the basis for sequels, prequels, and related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. W e believe that the development and
distribution of products and content based on established franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high
5
Table of Contents
unit volume sales and operating profits. W e intend to continue development of owned franchises in the future.
        We develop and produce our titles using a model in which a group of creative, technical, and production professionals, including designers, producers,
programmers, artists, and sound engineers, in coordination with our marketing, finance, analytics, sales, and other professionals, has responsibility for the entire
development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external resources. W e believe this model
allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.
        While most of the content for our franchises is developed by internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on
our behalf. From time to time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created by third-
party developers.
        We provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review , assess, and provide support to products throughout the
development process. Quality assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. W e subject all such content
to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and
other defects found in the products. T o support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to players through various means, primarily online and by
telephone.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
        Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly . This provides a significant marketing tool that allows us to
communicate and market directly to our customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends.
Our marketing ef forts also include activities on Facebook, T witter , Twitch, Y ouTube, and other online social networks, other online advertising, other public
relations activity , print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays),
participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet
or the digital online services provided by our partners. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of
consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional ef forts, as well as co-marketing from promotional partners.
        Our physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers
(e.g., Target, W almart), consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop), and other stores
(e.g., Amazon), or through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements.
        Most of our products and content are also available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience
directly to their console, PC, or mobile device through our platform partners, including Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.
("Sony"), Apple, Google, Nintendo Co., Ltd. ("Nintendo"), and Facebook. Blizzard utilizes its proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, to distribute
most of Blizzard's content and selected Activision content directly to PC consumers.
        In addition to serving as a distribution platform, Blizzard Battle.net of fers players communications features, social networking, player matching and digital
content delivery and is designed to allow people to connect regardless of which of our games on Blizzard Battle.net they are playing. It attracts millions of active
players, making it one of the lar gest online game-related services in the world.

Manufacturing
        We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. W ith respect to products for Microsoft, Sony , and Nintendo consoles, our disk
duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly , and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution facilities owned
by us.
        Microsoft, Sony , and Nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware technologies to
us. In return, we pay an applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order , even if the units do not ultimately sell. W e deliver the master
materials to the licensor or its approved replicator , who then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label.
Significant Customers and T op Franchises
Customers
        While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through Blizzard's proprietary online gaming service platform,
Blizzard Battle.net, in other instances our customers may be platform providers, such as Sony , Microsoft, Google, and Apple, or retailers, such as W almart and
GameStop, who act as distributors of our content to end consumers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three customers—Apple, Sony , and Google—
who accounted for 15%, 13%, and 1 1%, respectively , of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three customers—Apple, Sony , and Google
—who accounted for 16%, 14%, and 10%, respectively , of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had two customers—Sony and Apple—who
each accounted for 13% of net revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in the respective periods discussed above.
        We had two customers—Sony and NetEase, Inc.—who accounted for 15% and 12%, respectively , of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2018.
We had three customers—Sony , Microsoft, and Apple—who accounted for 17%, 14%, and 10%, respectively , of consolidated gross receivables at December 31,
2017. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated gross receivables in the respective periods discussed above.
Top Franchises
        For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top three franchises—Call of Duty , Candy Crush, and W orld of Warcraft—collectively accounted for 58% of our
net revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our top four franchises—Call of Duty , Candy Crush, W orld of Warcraft, and Overwatch—
collectively accounted for 66% and 69% of our net revenues, respectively . No other franchise comprised 10% or more of our net revenues in the respective
periods discussed above.
Competition
        We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with providers of
different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music and other consumer products.
        The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced.
We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality , and playability; brand name
recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price; marketing
support; and quality of customer service.
7
Table of Contents
        We compete with other publishers of video game console, PC, and mobile interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party software competitors,
integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony , and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of
software titles for their respective platforms. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for
use by consumers.
Intellectual Property
        Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual
property . Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology , and other technology and trade secrets that we use to
develop and run our games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear , and interact with when
they are playing our games.
        We develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty , World of W arcraft, and Candy Crush, among
others. In other cases, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements. Further , our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms
include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. W e also license technology from
providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and services. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business is
dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.
        We are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along with
other protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education
programs and legislative activity around the world. For our PC products, we use technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized
copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their platforms
to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms.

Item 1A.    RISK F ACT ORS 
        We wish to caution the r eader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewher e in this r eport or in our other
filings with the SEC, could cause our actual r esults to differ materially fr om those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and
elsewher e. These risks ar e not pr esented in order of importance or pr obability of occurr ence. Further , the risks described below ar e not the only risks
that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not curr ently known to us or that we curr ently deem immaterial may also impair our business
operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, r eputation, financial condition, r esults of operations, income, r evenue,
profitability , cash flows, liquidity , or stock price.
If we do not consistently deliver popular , high-quality content in a timely manner , or if consumers prefer competing products, our business may be negatively
impacted.
        Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and dif ficult to predict, and even the most successful content remains popular for only limited periods
of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or enhancements
to our existing products. These products or enhancements may not be well-received by consumers, even if well-reviewed and of high quality . Further , competitors
may develop content that imitates or competes with our best-selling games, potentially taking sales away from them or reducing our ability to char ge the same
prices we have historically char ged for our products. These competing products may take a lar ger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause
product sales to fall below expectations. If we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received games, if our marketing fails to resonate
with our consumers, if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce, if the use of cross-promotion within our mobile games to retain consumers
becomes less ef fective, or if our competitors develop more successful products or of fer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues and profit mar gins
could decline. Further , a failure by us to develop a high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well-received, could potentially
result in additional expenditures to respond to consumer demands, harm our reputation, and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well-
received. The increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly-received games typically
generates lower -than-expected sales. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games.
        Additionally , consumer expectations regarding the quality , performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our
brands, games, services, and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to
manage ef fectively . For example, if our games or services, such as our proprietary online gaming service, do not function as consumers expect, whether because
they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suf fer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online
features because they involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy . Our games with online features are also
frequently updated, increasing the risk that a game may contain significant errors, or "bugs." If any of these issues occur , consumers may stop playing the game
and may be less likely to return to the game as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business.
        Further , delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could negatively impact our business and
reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially dif ferent from expectations. If we fail to release our products in a timely manner , or if we are
unable to continue to extend the life of existing games by adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with the game, our business
may be negatively impacted.
11
Table of Contents
        Additionally , the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in
developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for
such product. If our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate suf ficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to
recover the substantial up-front development and marketing costs associated with those products.
We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.
        We follow a franchise model and a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number of
popular franchises. These products are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, revenues associated with the Call of Duty ,
Candy Crush, and W orld of Warcraft franchises, collectively , accounted for approximately 58% of our net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our
operating income—for 2018. W e expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of
our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on
these franchises could negatively impact our business. Additionally , if the popularity of a franchise declines, we may have to write of f the unrecovered portion of
the underlying intellectual property assets, which could negatively impact our business.
We may be unable to ef fectively manage the continued growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including our expansion into new business models
that are untested and into adjacent business opportunities with large, established competitors.
        We have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through the King Acquisition and the development of our
esports, advertising, Studios, and consumer products businesses, and remain ambitious as to the future growth in the scope and complexity of our business. Our
future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business and our aspirations for continued expansion. W e have dedicated resources both to
new business models that are lar gely untested, as is the case with esports, and to adjacent business opportunities in which very lar ge competitors have an
established presence, as is the case with our Studios and consumer products businesses. W e do not know to what extent our future expansions will be successful.
Further , even if successful, the growth of our business could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, and could
increase existing strain on, and divert focus from, our core businesses. If not managed ef fectively , this growth could result in the over -extension of our operating
infrastructure, and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth.
Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our business. Further , any failure
by these new businesses may damage our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our core business of interactive software products and entertainment content.
Conversely , the success of these new businesses is, in lar ge part, contingent on the success of the underlying franchises and, as such, a decline in the popularity of
a franchise may impact the success of the new businesses adjacent to that franchise.
We may not realize the expected financial and operational benefits of our recently announced restructuring plan, and its implementation may negatively
impact our business.
        In February 2019, we announced a restructuring plan under which we plan to refocus our resources on our lar gest opportunities and to remove unnecessary
levels of complexity and duplication from certain parts of our business. While we believe this restructuring plan will enable us to provide better opportunities for
talent, and greater expertise and scale on behalf of our business units, our ability to
12
Table of Contents
achieve the desired and anticipated benefits from the restructuring plan within our desired and expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions,
and the actual savings and timing for those savings may vary materially based on factors such as local labor regulations, negotiations with third parties, and
operational requirements. These estimates and assumptions are also subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are
beyond our control. Further , there can be no assurance that our business will be more ef ficient or ef fective than prior to implementation of the plan, or that
additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future. The implementation of this restructuring plan may also be costly and disruptive to
our business or have other negative consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or negative impacts on employee morale and
productivity , or on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Any of these consequences could negatively impact our business.
The increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition.
        The proportion of our revenues derived from digital distributional channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The increased
importance of digital channels in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered
game, particularly a new game for mobile platforms, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail
distribution and is played on a game console or PC. Also, while digitally-distributed products generally have higher profit mar gins than retail sales, as business
shifts to digital distribution, the volume of orders from retailers for physical discs has been, and may continue to be, reduced. Further , the providers of the
platforms through which we digitally distribute content are also publishers of their own content distributed on those platforms, and, therefore, a platform provider
may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors.
The importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.
        While the proportion of our revenues derived from digital distributional channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase, retail sales
remain important to our business. In the United States and Canada, our "boxed" products are often sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer
electronics stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores. Our "boxed" products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party
distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order
basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments, and, due to the increased proportion of our revenue from digital distribution channels, our
retail customers and distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to carry . The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any
of Activision's principal retail customers or distributors could have adverse consequences.
        Moreover , the importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and
retailers. In some cases, return policies allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged, and certain other products in accordance with
terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise
unsold by them. W e may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, distributors and retail customers who meet certain conditions. These conditions
may include compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery of weekly inventory and sales information and consistent participation in the launches of
premium title releases. W e may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other industry factors. Activision also of fers a
limited warranty to end users that Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection,
and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could be
13
Table of Contents
forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution
channels. W e face similar issues and risks, including exposure to risk of char gebacks, with respect to end users to whom we sell products directly , whether
through our proprietary online gaming service or otherwise.
        Further , retailers typically have a limited amount of "brick and mortar" shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition for high-
quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. Similarly , for online retail sales, there is increasing competition for premium placements on
websites. Competition for shelf space or premium online placement may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Further , retailers
with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers. W e cannot be certain that our new
products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an increasingly
better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees, and product return policies. Our
products constitute a relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. W e cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or
provide those products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms.
        Additionally , we make provisions for retail inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to
lower our prices below those levels, it could similarly have a negative impact on our business. Further , because we pay a licensing fee to the console hardware
manufacturer for each physical copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform regardless of whether that product is actually sold, if we
overestimate demand and make too many physical "boxed" copies of any title, we will incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units.
Due to our reliance on third-party platforms, platform providers are frequently able to influence our products and costs.
        Generally , when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms of fered by companies such as Sony , Microsoft, or Nintendo,
the physical products are replicated exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator . The agreements with these manufacturers include
certain provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they char ge for the
manufacturing of products, which allow the hardware manufacturers substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment
software products. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and may manufacture products for
other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors. Accordingly , console manufacturers like Sony , Microsoft, or
Nintendo could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products, as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution
costs, any of which could negatively impact our business.
        The platform providers also control the networks over which consumers purchase digital products and services for their platforms and through which we
provide online game capabilities for our products. The control that the platform providers have over the fee structures and/or retail pricing for products and
services for their platforms and online networks could impact the volume of purchases of our products made over their networks and our profitability . With
respect to certain downloadable content and microtransactions, the networks provided by these platform providers are the exclusive means of selling and
distributing this content. Further , increased competition for limited premium "digital shelf space" has placed the platform providers in an increasingly better
position to negotiate favorable terms of sale. If the platform provider establishes terms that restrict our of ferings on its platform, significantly impact the financial
terms on which these products or services are of fered, or
14
Table of Contents
does not approve the inclusion of online capabilities in our console products, our business could be negatively impacted.
        We also derive significant revenues from the distribution on third-party mobile and web platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and
Facebook, and most of the virtual currency we sell is purchased using the payment processing systems of these platform providers. These platforms also serve as
significant online distribution platforms for , and/or provide other services critical for the operation of, a number of our games. If these platforms modify their
current discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, operating systems, terms of service or other policies (including fees), or they
develop their own competitive of ferings, our business could be negatively impacted. Additionally , if these platform providers are required to change how they
label free-to-play games or take payment for in-app purchases or change how the personal information of consumers is made available to developers, our business
could be negatively impacted. These platform providers or their services may be unavailable for short periods of time or experience issues with their in-app
purchasing functionality . If either of these events occurs on a prolonged, or even short-term, basis or other similar issues arise that impact players' ability to access
our games, access social features or make purchases, it may result in lost revenues and otherwise negatively impact our business.
Our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game consoles manufactured by third parties, as well as our ability to develop
commercially successful products for these consoles.
        We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game consoles manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PS4,
Microsoft's Xbox One, and Nintendo's Switch. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted for 34% of our consolidated net revenues in 2018. The
success of our console business is driven in lar ge part by our ability to accurately predict which consoles will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to
develop commercially successful products for these consoles. W e also rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these video game consoles and the
continued support for these consoles by their manufacturers. W e must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of
the anticipated introduction of a new console, and development costs to create content for new consoles may be greater than those costs for the then-current
consoles. If increased costs are not of fset by higher revenues and other cost ef ficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the consoles for which we
develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant consumer acceptance, we may not be able to recover our development costs,
which could be significant.
The increasing importance of free-to-play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including the dependence on a relatively small
number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any given game.
        As a result of, among other things, the King Acquisition, we are more dependent on our ability to develop, enhance, and monetize free-to-play games, such
as the games in our Candy Crush franchise and Hearthstone.  As such, we are increasingly exposed to the risks of the free-to-play business model. For example,
we may invest in the development of new free-to-play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which case our
revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Further , if: (1) we are unable to continue to
offer free-to-play games that encourage consumers to purchase our virtual currency and subsequently use it to buy our virtual items; (2) we fail to of fer
monetization features that appeal to these consumers; (3) these consumers do not continue to play our free-to-play games or purchase virtual items at the same
rate; (4) our platform providers make it more dif ficult or expensive for players to purchase our virtual currency; or (5) we cannot encourage significant additional
consumers to purchase virtual items in our free-to-play games, our business may be negatively impacted.
15
Table of Contents
        Furthermore, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing mobile or online free-to-play or other casual games, we have seen, and expect to
continue to see new competitors enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to developing and marketing competing games and
applications. W e compete, or may compete, with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch casual games and other
content using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. Competition for the attention of consumers on mobile devices is
intense, as the number of applications on mobile devices has been increasing dramatically , which, in turn, has required increased marketing to garner consumer
awareness and attention. This increased competition has negatively impacted, and is expected to continue to negatively impact our business. In addition, a
continuing industry shift to free-to-play games could result in a deprioritization of our other products by traditional retailers and distributors.
We may be involved in legal proceedings that have a negative impact on our business.
        From time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, investigations, audits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including with
respect to intellectual property , competition and antitrust matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, privacy matters, labor and employment matters, compliance
matters, unclaimed property matters, liability and personal injury claims, product damage claims, collection matters, and/or commercial claims. In addition,
negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as
litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be damaging to our reputation.
        Claims, suits, investigations, audits, and proceedings are inherently dif ficult to predict and their results are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which
are outside of our control. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have a negative impact on us due to legal costs, diversion of management
resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, substantial settlements,
judgments, fines or penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from of fering certain features, functionalities, products or services,
requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.
        There is also inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for these matters. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of these matters, including
assessing the probability of potential outcomes and determining whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In making these determinations, we, in
consultation with outside counsel, examine the relevant facts and circumstances on a quarterly basis assuming, as applicable, a combination of settlement and
litigated outcomes and strategies. Further , it may take time to develop factors on which reasonable judgments and estimates can be based. If we fail to establish
appropriate reserves, our business could be negatively impacted.
Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our business.
        We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate income tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. Although we
believe our income tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcomes may have a negative impact on our business.
        Our income tax liability and ef fective tax rate could be adversely af fected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, the mix of earnings in
countries with dif fering statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, changes in interpretations of existing laws, or developments in tax examinations or
investigations. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The tax
regimes we are subject to, or operate under , are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. A number of countries are
16
Table of Contents
actively pursuing fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies like us. Furthermore, tax authorities may choose to examine or
investigate our tax reporting or tax liability , including under transfer pricing or permanent establishment theories. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or
proposed adjustments to our income taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions.
        On December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation known as the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "U.S. T ax Reform Act") was enacted in the United States. The U.S.
Tax Reform Act introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law that have had a meaningful impact on our financial position and ef fective tax rate.
Accounting for the income tax ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act and subsequent guidance issued required complex new calculations to be performed and
significant judgments in interpreting the legislation. Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. T ax Reform Act will be applied or
otherwise administered that is dif ferent from our interpretation, which could result in adjustments to the income tax ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act we have
recorded at December 31, 2018. These adjustments could have a negative impact on our business.
        In December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the French T ax Authority ("FT A") related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions
involving one of our French subsidiaries for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years. W e disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. W e
plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve this matter , including administrative remedies with the FT A, and, if necessary , judicial remedies.
While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant
additional tax liabilities. In addition to the risk of additional tax for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined
and/or if the FT A were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
        In December 2018, we received a decision from the Swedish T ax Agency ("ST A") informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for
the 2016 tax year . We disagree with the ST A's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. W e plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve
the matter , including administrative remedies with the ST A, multilateral procedures with other relevant taxing jurisdictions, and, if necessary , judicial remedies.
Further , we may be required to pay the full assessment to the ST A in advance of the final resolution of the matter . While we believe our tax provisions at
December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
        We are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property , and goods and services taxes, in both
the United States and various other jurisdictions. T ax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in
the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax matters may have a negative impact on our business.
Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging technologies and
business models, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry . We must continually anticipate and adapt our products, distribution channels, and
business models to emer ging technologies and delivery platforms to stay competitive. Forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new products,
distribution channels and business models is inherently uncertain and volatile, and if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products or
distribution channels incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition
or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial "up front" costs of developing and marketing those products and distribution channels, or recover the
opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels. Further , our competitors may adapt to an
emer ging technology or business model more quickly or ef fectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to
consumers, or both.
17
Table of Contents
        If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to
pursue new business models, that achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and expenditures to
shift product development resources to that technology , platform or business model, as the case may be, and it may be more dif ficult to compete against existing
products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model.
Competition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.
        We compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software, both within and outside the United States. Our competitors include very lar ge
corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. Our lar ger competitors may be able to leverage their
greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources to provide lar ger budgets for development and marketing and make higher of fers to licensors and
developers for commercially desirable properties, as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful video game
products than we do. In addition, competitors with lar ge portfolios and popular games typically have greater influence with platform providers, retailers,
distributors and other customers who may , in turn, provide more favorable support to those competitors' games.
        Additionally , we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. As our business continues to expand in complexity and scope, we have
increased exposure to additional competitors, including those with access to lar ge existing user bases and control over distribution channels. Further , it is dif ficult
to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for dif ferent forms of entertainment and leisure
activities. Failure to adequately identify and adapt to these competitive pressures could negatively impact our business.
If we are unable to sell our products at the prices we planned to, our business may be negatively impacted.
        If we are unable to sell our products at the prices we planned, whether due to competitive pressure, including the continuing industry shift to free-to-play
games, because retailers or other third parties elect to price these products at a lower price, or otherwise, it has, and is expected to continue to have, a negative
impact on our business. Further , our decisions around the development of new game content are grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. If there is
price compression in the market after these decisions are made, it could have a negative impact on our business.
If we do not continue to attract, retain, and motivate skilled personnel, we will be unable to ef fectively conduct our business.
        Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify , attract, hire, retain, motivate, and utilize the abilities of qualified personnel, particularly
personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high-quality , well-received content upon which our business is substantially dependent. Our
industry is generally characterized by a high level of employee mobility , competitive compensation programs, and aggressive recruiting among competitors for
employees with technical, marketing, sales, engineering, product development, creative, and/or management skills. W e may have dif ficulties in attracting and
retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the services of
key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.

We rely on external developers to develop some of our software products.
        We rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products. Because we depend on these developers, we are subject to the following
risks:
• continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may cause
developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable
to us; 
• limited financial resources and business expertise or the inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to
completing products for us or require us to fund additional costs; 
• a competitor may acquire the business of one or more key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and, in either case, we
would not be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for any period for which the developer is contractually
obligated to complete development for us; and 
• reliance on external developers reduces our visibility into, and control over , development schedules and operational outcomes compared to those
when utilizing internal development resources.
We engage in strategic transactions and may encounter dif ficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of these
transactions.
        As part of our business strategy , from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with, complementary
businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (1) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the potential for the acquired
business to underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for the acquired business to cause our financial results to dif fer
from expectations in any given period, or over the longer -term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax treatment of the acquired
business's operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax liabilities that are dif ficult to predict, (iv) dif ficulty in integrating the acquired business, its
operations, and its employees in an ef ficient and ef fective manner , (v) any unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition,
and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; and (2) in the case of an investment, alliance, or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate
with our partner , (ii) our partner having economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and (iii) the potential that our partner may
be unable to meet its economic or other obligations, which may require us to fulfill those obligations alone. Further , any such transaction may involve the risk that
our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated, and that any
intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or
other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.
Our debt could adversely af fect our business.
        As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $2.7 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Our debt burden could have important consequences,
including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for , or reacting to, changes in our
business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flows from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy ,
19
Table of Contents
working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or
causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and
development, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive
disadvantage relative to competitors who have lower levels of debt. Further , though our current long-term debt all bears fixed interest rates, if and when we have
borrowings at floating rates of interest, it could expose us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to those borrowings.
        Agreements governing our indebtedness, including our credit agreement entered into on October 1 1, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the
"Credit Agreement") and the indentures governing our notes, impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply
with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Credit Agreement and our indentures may limit or prohibit other
activities. In addition, we are required to maintain a maximum total net debt ratio calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under the Credit
Agreement. Further , various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could af fect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with
any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions.
Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, we might not have suf ficient funds
or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our notes. In addition, the
limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other
financing. There can be no assurances that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if, for any reason, we are unable to comply with these
agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
We may not be able to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing under that facility .
        We view our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility as a source of available liquidity . This facility contains various conditions, covenants and representations
with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. W e have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility to date, but if we wish to do so, there
can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations at such time.
The LIBOR calculation method may change and LIBOR is expected to be phased out after 2021.
        Interest on our revolving credit facility , which is scheduled to mature in 2023, is calculated based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority (the "FCA") announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In the meantime, actions by the
FCA, other regulators, or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict
the ef fect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the U.K. or elsewhere on our revolving credit facility .
Lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against publishers of interactive entertainment software products.
        In prior years, lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies, including against us, by the families of victims of violence,
alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence. These lawsuits have been dismissed, but similar
additional lawsuits could be filed in the future. Although our general liability
20
Table of Contents
insurance carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature with respect to the prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would do so in the future,
or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor . Further , any such
lawsuit could result in increased governmental scrutiny , harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, or decreased willingness by our
customers to purchase, or by our partners to provide marketing support for , those products. Such results could divert development and management resources,
increase legal fees and other costs, and have other negative impacts on our business.
We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.
        The interactive entertainment industry is somewhat seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the calendar year -end holiday
buying season. As a result, our sales have historically been highest during the fourth quarter of the year , particularly for our Activision segment. Receivables and
credit risk are likewise higher during the fourth quarter of the year , as retailers increase their purchases of our products in anticipation of the holiday season.
Delays in development, approvals or manufacturing could af fect the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year -end
holiday buying season, which could negatively impact our business.
Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other third parties with whom we do business act in ways
that put our brand at risk.
        In many cases, our business partners are given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property to provide services
and support to our team. These third parties may misappropriate our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it or otherwise act in a
way that places our brand at risk. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, the failure of third parties to adequately
maintain or update their services and technologies, or the misappropriation or misuse of this information or intellectual property could result in a disruption to our
business operations or an adverse ef fect on our reputation and may negatively impact our business.
We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and
services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.
        We use open source software in connection with some of the games and services we of fer. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute
open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the
open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that such
licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. W ere it determined that our
use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer
our games or products, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may
divert resources away from our game development ef forts, any of which could negatively impact our business.
We may be subject to intellectual property claims.
        As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software
developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims. Further , many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on
real-world things or people, which may also be the subject of claims of infringement of the
21
Table of Contents
intellectual property of others, including right of publicity , trademark, and unfair competition claims. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting-edge
technology that may become subject to emer ging intellectual property claims of others. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual
property rights of others, third parties may still claim infringement, particularly since there are many companies that focus exclusively on enforcing patent rights.
        From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether
meritorious or not, may be time consuming, distracting to management, and expensive to defend. Further , intellectual property litigation or claims could force us
to do one or more of the following:
• cease selling, incorporating, supporting, or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
• obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property , which, if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable
terms; 
• redesign the af fected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce
commercial appeal of the af fected products; or 
• pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.
Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us
from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. Further , the use of unauthorized "cheat" programs or the use of other unauthorized software
modifications by users could impact multiplayer gameplay or lead to reductions in microtransactions in our games.
        We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and
employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. W e own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade
secrets. The process of registering and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time-consuming. Further , we are aware that some
unauthorized copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur , it could negatively impact our
business.
        Piracy is a persistent problem for us, and policing the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products is dif ficult, expensive, and time-consuming.
Further , the laws of some countries in which our products are, or may be, distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. In addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our
products more dif ficult and to enforce and police our rights, as do the manufacturers of consoles and the operators of other platforms on which many of our games
are played, these ef forts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products in all instances. T echnology designed to circumvent the protection
measures used by console manufacturers and platform operators or by us in our products, the refusal of Internet service providers to remove infringing content in
certain instances and the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet sites and peer -to-peer networks could result in an expansion in piracy .
        In addition, "cheating" programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games could negatively impact the
volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content. In addition, vulnerabilities in the design of our products or the platforms upon which they run
could be discovered after their release, which may result in lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to
respond to these, either of which could negatively impact our business.
        We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emer ging technologies.

The insolvency or business failure of any of our business partners could negatively impact us.
        Our sales, whether digital or retail, are concentrated in a small number of lar ge customers. This makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of
these lar ge customers becomes unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. Retailers and distributors in the interactive
entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed. Challenging economic
conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased and, as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-of f of
accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insuf ficient. Moreover , even in cases where we have insurance to protect against a
customer's bankruptcy , insolvency , or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation and does not cover all
instances of non-payment. Further , the insolvency or business failure of other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or
distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be favorable. A payment default by , or the insolvency or business
failure of, a significant business partner could negatively impact our business. In addition, having such a lar ge portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a
few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.
We are a global company and are subject to the risks and uncertainties of conducting business outside the U.S.
        We conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of our revenues and profits from international trade, particularly from
Europe, Asia, and Australia. Moving forward, we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits
and, moreover , that sales in emer ging markets in Asia and elsewhere will be an increasingly important part of our international sales. As such, we are, and may be
increasingly , subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally , as well as risks inherent in doing business in emer ging markets, including increased tarif fs and
duties, compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political,
regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement on us and our platform partners and dif fering
local business practices, all of which may impact profit mar gins or make it more dif ficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.
        A deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of
government regulations in such a country , could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a negative
impact on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval
for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally , in
the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our products. The future implementation of similar laws or regulations in
China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering modifications to our
products that are not cost-ef fective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such
products. The Chinese game approval procedure was suspended from March 2018 until January 2019 and, due to the lar ge number of pending applications, it
remains uncertain as to if and when our new products will be approved for release in China. Further , the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other
games with an online element in China remains uncertain, and further changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could have a negative impact on our
business in China.
        We are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners,
representatives, or agents in ways that violate the
23
Table of Contents
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or other similar anti-bribery laws, as well as the 2017 U.K. Criminal Finances Act or other similar
financial crime laws. While we have policies and procedures, as well as training for our employees, intended to secure compliance with these laws, our
employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives, or agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover , it may be more dif ficult to oversee the
conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.
        In addition, cultural dif ferences may af fect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S. or require us to
modify the content of the games or the method by which we char ge our customers for the games to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer
preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, or if the other risks discussed herein come to fruition, it could negatively impact our business.
        Additionally , in June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union (the "E.U."), commonly
referred to as "Brexit." The United Kingdom commenced withdrawal proceedings with the E.U. in March 2017, and, on March 29, 2019, is scheduled to leave the
E.U. These withdrawal proceedings have created political and economic uncertainty , particularly in the United Kingdom and the E.U., and this uncertainty may
persist for years. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor
confidence and the level of sales of discretionary items, including our products. The terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal could negatively impact global
financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could have a negative impact on our business, our suppliers and business partners,
or our lenders and financial counterparties. Further , the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences could potentially cause adverse
disruptions to our operations, including our workforce, or the workforce of our suppliers, business partners, lenders or financial counterparties, in the United
Kingdom or the E.U. as a result of potential changes to applicable employment or immigration rules, and our systems and information technology infrastructure
or that of our suppliers, business partners, lenders or financial counterparties as a result of potential changes to regulations for data security or other data
protection rules. Given our extensive global operations, the potential widespread impacts triggered through Brexit could adversely af fect our business.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.
        We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar , subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local
currencies, including euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona, which could fluctuate against the U.S.
dollar . Since we have significant international sales but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations,
particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar , may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. W e have, in the past, utilized currency
derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures and managed these exposures with natural of fsets. However , there can be no assurance that we
will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do so.
Our games are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If we fail to receive our target ratings for certain titles, or if our retailers
refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.
        Our console and PC games are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the "ESRB"), a self-regulatory body based in the U.S. that
provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in
24
Table of Contents
such software, such as violence, nudity , or sexual content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other countries
have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In addition, certain stores use other ratings systems, such as
Apple's use of its proprietary "App Rating System" and Google Play's use of the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) rating system. If we are unable to
obtain the ratings we have tar geted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In some instances, we may be required to modify our
products to meet the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain
territories. Further , if one of our games is "re-rated" for any reason, a ratings or ganization could require corrective actions, which could include a recall, retailers
could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies previously
purchased.
        Additionally , retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material
or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system,
or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit
material, or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles with that
retailer .
        Further , throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry , many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden
gameplay features, some of which have been accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the gameplay
experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to disclose pertinent
hidden content during the ESRB ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose hidden content, and the ESRB has required the recall of the
game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the game or game packaging and/or
imposed fines on the publisher . Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves,
refusing to sell them, and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed
content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the
company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such
content.
        We have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software
products we publish. Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error , circumvention, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints. If an
interactive software product we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.
Our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of objectionable third party-created content.
        Certain of our games support collaborative online features that allow consumers to post narrative comments, in real time, that are visible to other consumers.
Additionally , certain of our games allow consumers to create and share "user -generated content" that is visible to other consumers. From time to time,
objectionable and of fensive consumer content may be distributed within our games through these features or to gaming websites or forums that allow consumers
to post comments. Additionally , we have begun to generate revenue through of fering advertising within certain of our franchises. The content of in-game
advertisements is generally created and delivered by third-party advertisers without our pre-approval, and, as such, objectionable content may be published in our
games by these
25
Table of Contents
advertisers. This objectionable third party-created content may expose us to regulatory action or claims related to content, or otherwise negatively impact our
business.
Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our
business could be negatively impacted.
        The video game industry continues to evolve, and new and innovative business opportunities are often subject to new attempts at regulation. As such,
legislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may af fect the way in which we, and other
industry participants, may of fer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. These laws, regulations, and investigations are related to
protection of minors, gambling, consumer privacy , accessibility , advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property , distribution, and antitrust, among others.
        For example, many foreign countries have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment
software products because of the content therein (and similar legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the United
States, including legislation that attempts to impose additional taxes based on content). In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that restrict or prohibit
marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products with random digital item mechanics, which some of our online games and services
include, or subject to such products to additional regulation and oversight, such as reporting to regulators. Also, although we have structured and operate our skill
tournaments with applicable laws in mind, including any applicable laws relating to gambling, and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling,
our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties. W e also
sometimes of fer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities. W e are subject to laws in a number of
jurisdictions concerning the operation and of fering of tournaments and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm
our business. Further , the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer
protection laws that may impose additional burdens or limitations on operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile
devices. Also, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, regulation of currency , banking institutions, unclaimed property , and
money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. Further , in 2018, gaming addiction was listed as a mental health condition for the first
time by the W orld Health Or ganization, and some countries have introduced legislation attempting to address this issue. Moreover , the public dialogue concerning
interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers' willingness to purchase our products.
        The adoption and enforcement of legislation that restricts the marketing, content, business model, or sales of our products in countries in which we do
business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to of fer to our customers and the size of the potential audience for our products may be
limited. W e may be required to modify certain product development processes or products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with regulations, which
could be costly or delay the release of our products. In addition, the laws and regulations af fecting our products vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one
another , imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in government-imposed fines or other
penalties, as well as harm to our reputation. Because the King Acquisition significantly increased our user population, we are subject us to laws and regulations in
additional jurisdictions, which may exacerbate the potential adverse impact on our business.
26

Change in government regulations relating to the Internet could negatively impact our business.
        We rely on our consumers' access to significant levels of Internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of our
games with online features. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely af fect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting "net
neutrality ," could impair our consumers' online video game experiences, decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business.
Although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent Internet service providers from discriminating against particular types
of legal traf fic on their networks, other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal existing laws or regulations. For example, in December 2017,
the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the U.S. and, following that decision, several states enacted net neutrality
regulations. Given uncertainty around these rules relating to the Internet, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal of those rules, coupled with
the potentially significant political and economic power of local Internet service providers and the relatively significant level of Internet bandwidth access our
products and services require, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional
expenses, or otherwise negatively impact our business.
The laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.
        Consumers play certain of our games online using our own distribution platforms, including Blizzard Battle.net, third-party platforms and networks, through
online social platforms, and on mobile devices. W e collect and store information about our consumers, including consumers who play these games. In addition,
we collect and store information about our employees. W e are subject to laws from a variety of jurisdictions regarding privacy and the protection of this
information, including the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPP A"), which
regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age, and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Failure to
comply with any of these laws or regulations may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations, and result in substantial
fines.
        Data privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. For example, the E.U. has traditionally taken a broader view than the United States and certain other jurisdictions as to what is considered personal
information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy and protection regulations, including those imposed under the GDPR. The U.S. government,
including the Federal T rade Commission and the Department of Commerce, as well as various U.S. state governments, are continuing to review the need for
greater regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices. Complying with
emer ging and changing laws could require us to incur substantial costs or impact our approach to operating and marketing our games. Due to the rapidly changing
nature of these data privacy protection laws, there is not always clear guidance from the respective governments and regulators regarding the interpretation of the
law, which may create the risk of an inadvertent violation. For example, the California legislature recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act and the
E.U. has proposed further reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, in addition to the GDPR, which may further change our compliance obligations.
Various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. In addition, in some cases, we are
dependent upon our platform providers and external data processors to assist us in ensuring compliance with these various types of regulations, and a violation by
one of these third parties may also subject us to government investigations and result in substantial fines.

        Player interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policies, end user license agreements ("EULAs"), and terms of service. If we fail to comply with
our posted privacy policies, EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could
result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation,
impact our financial condition, and harm our business. If regulators, the media, consumers, or employees raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection
or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, negatively impact our
financial condition, or damage our business.
We depend on servers and networks to operate our games with online features and our proprietary online gaming service. If we were to lose functionality in
any of these areas for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Our business relies on the continuous operation of servers, some of which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we strive to maintain more than
sufficient server capacity , and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a
significant service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company
on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely degrade or interrupt the functionality of our games with
online features, and could prevent the operation of such games altogether , any of which could result in the loss of sales for , or in, such games. The risk is
particularly pronounced with respect to the mobile games published by King, which rely on a small number of third-party owned data centers located in one city ,
with respect to the functioning of our proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, the disruption of which could prevent Blizzard from delivering
content digitally or render all of Blizzard games, as well as selected Activision content for the PC platform, unavailable, or with Activision's multiplayer game
services which rely on systems hosted in a hybrid of data centers across the world as well as cloud providers.
        We also rely on networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and Steam, for the sale and digital delivery of downloadable
console and PC game content and the functionality of our games with online features. Similarly , we rely on the continued operation of the Apple App Store, the
Google Play Store, and Facebook for the sale of virtual currency for our free-to-play games. An extended interruption to any of these services could adversely
affect our ability to sell and distribute our digital products and operate our games with online features, which could result in a loss of revenue and otherwise
negatively impact our business.
        Further , insuf ficient server capacity could also negatively impact our business. Conversely , if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our
business, we may incur additional operating costs.
Any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively
impact our business.
        In the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store, and/or use commercially sensitive information, such as
the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and sensitive and confidential information with respect to our customers,
consumers, and employees. A malicious cybersecurity-related attack, intrusion, or disruption by hackers (including through spyware, viruses, phishing, denial of
service, and similar attacks) or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personal information), and other
sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity , disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers', consumers' or
employees' personal information (including personally identifiable information), or our own business

data. Such incidents could also lead to product code-base and game distribution platform exploitation, should undetected viruses, spyware, or other malware be
inserted into our products, services, or networks, or systems used by our consumers. W e have implemented cybersecurity programs and the tools, technologies,
processes, and procedures intended to secure our data and systems, and prevent and detect unauthorized access to, or loss of, our data, or the data of our
customers, consumers, or employees. However , because these cyberattacks may remain undetected for prolonged periods of time and the techniques used by
criminal hackers and other third parties to breach systems change frequently , we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative
measures. A data intrusion into a server for a game with online features or for our proprietary online gaming service could also disrupt the operation of such game
or platform. If we are subject to cybersecurity breaches, or a security-related incident that materially disrupts the availability of our products and services, we may
have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other costs, including from the implementation of additional cyber and physical security
measures, or suf fer reputational damage. Additionally , while we maintain insurance policies, they may be insuf ficient to reimburse the Company for all losses or
all types of claims that may be caused by cyberbreaches or system or network disruptions. Moreover , if there were a public perception that our data protection
measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or the public perception
of our business model. In addition, such cybersecurity breaches may subject us to legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions,
especially if there is loss, disclosure, or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers' personal information or other sensitive information, or there is otherwise
an intrusion into our customers' privacy .
Our reported financial results could be significantly impacted by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future
accounting standards to our business as it evolves.
        Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the methods,
estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies af fecting revenue recognition have af fected, and could further significantly
affect, the way we report revenues related to our products and services. W e recognize a majority of the revenues from video games that include an online service
on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the cost of revenues of those products. Further , as we increase our
downloadable content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period may change, and we could be required to recognize
revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product of ferings, the application
of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and income taxes, could have a significant
impact on our reported net revenues, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in any given period.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.
        Our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special
meetings. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more dif ficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder
approval of actions that would support this ef fort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called
"blank check" preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could ef fectively dilute the
interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more dif ficult to obtain control.

Historically , our stock price has been highly volatile.
        The trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including for example,
but without limitation:
• quarter -to-quarter variations in the results of our operations; 
• the announcement of new products; 
• the announcement of lower prices on competing products; 
• product development or release schedules; 
• general conditions in the computer , software, entertainment, media or electronics industries, or in the worldwide economy; 
• announcements of developments in the overall worldwide audience for interactive entertainment, including announcements of industry sales data; 
• the timing of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new platforms; 
• hardware manufacturers' announcements of price changes for hardware platforms; 
• consumer acceptance of hardware platforms; 
• consumer spending trends; 
• the outcome of lawsuits or regulatory investigations in which we are, or may become, involved; 
• changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; 
• sales or acquisitions of common stock by our directors or executive management; and 
• investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position, and those of our competitors and customers.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
        Our corporate headquarters and our primary corporate data center are located in the Los Angeles, California area, which is near a major earthquake fault. A
major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, or
otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and negatively impact our
business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance
coverage we maintain. Further , our system redundancy may be inef fective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be suf ficient for all
eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers, distributors or our other customers to sell or distribute our products.
If general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.
        Purchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary
purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are
sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in
our selling and promotional expenses, in an ef fort to of fset that reduction, and could negatively impact our business.

Item 2.    PROPER TIES 
        Our principal corporate and administrative of fices, which includes our Activision segment's headquarters, are located in Santa Monica, California and consist
of approximately 165,000 square feet of leased of fice space.
        Our Activision segment primarily leases of fice space for development studio personnel, with a total of approximately 475,000 square feet of leased spaces
throughout the U.S., primarily in California, New Y ork, and W isconsin. W e also lease approximately 721,000 square feet of of fice space in Irvine, CA for our
Blizzard segment's headquarters, which includes administrative and development studio space, and approximately 68,000 square feet of of fice space in London,
United Kingdom for our King segment's headquarter of fices. King also leases approximately 210,000 square feet of of fice space in Barcelona, Spain for
additional administrative and development studio space.
        In total, we have approximately 100 facility leases, primarily for other administrative and sales functions and development studio personnel, in the following
countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany , Ireland, Italy , Japan, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Spain,
Sweden, T aiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
        The only facilities currently owned by the Company are two European warehouses utilized by the Distribution segment, one located in Bur glengenfeld,
Germany , and the other in V enlo, the Netherlands.
        We anticipate no dif ficulty in extending the leases of our facilities or obtaining comparable facilities in suitable locations, as needed, and we consider our
facilities to be adequate for our current needs.
Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
        In December 2018, we received a decision from the ST A informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for the 2016 tax year . The
STA decision described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion (approximately $400 million) primarily concerning an
alleged intercompany asset transfer . We disagree with the ST A's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. W e plan to pursue all remedies available to us to
successfully resolve the matter , including administrative remedies with the ST A, multilateral procedures with other relevant taxing jurisdictions, and, if necessary ,
judicial remedies. Further , we may be required to pay the full assessment to the ST A in advance of the final resolution of the matter . While we believe our tax
provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
        In December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the FT A related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions involving one of our
French subsidiaries for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately €571 million (approximately
$652 million). W e disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. W e plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully
resolve this matter , including administrative remedies with the FT A and, if necessary , judicial remedies. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31,
2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition to the risk of
additional tax for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined and/or if the FT A were to seek adjustments of a
similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

matters, unclaimed property matters, liability and personal injury claims, product damage claims, collection matters, and/or commercial claims. In the opinion of
management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity .

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF OPERA TIONS 
Business Overview
        Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. W e develop and distribute content and
services on video game consoles, PC, and mobile devices. W e also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television content based on our
intellectual property . The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company ," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.
The King Acquisition
        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, as further described in Note 23 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.
Reportable Segments
        Based upon our or ganizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.
(i)    Activision
        Activision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platforms.
Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or
related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed
intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.
        In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie to publish games in the Destiny franchise. Ef fective December 31, 2018, Activision
and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its
publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie's assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision. Going
forward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise. As a result of the agreement to terminate the relationship, the
Company recognized net bookings—a key operating metric—of $20 million, GAAP revenues of $164 million, and GAAP operating income of $91 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018.
(ii)   Blizzar d
        Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard
primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party
or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates
digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity , and the creation of user -generated content. Blizzard also
includes the activities of the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and our MLG business, which is
responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.
36
Table of Contents
(iii)  King
        King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily on mobile platforms, such as Google's Android
and Apple's iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King's games are free to play; however , players can
acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency , and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.
Other
        We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:
• the Studios business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual
properties; and 
• the Distribution business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Business Results and Highlights
Financial Results
        The Company's 2018 financial results are presented in accordance with a new revenue accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2018. Prior
period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting standards. Further information about our adoption of the new standard is provided in
Notes 2 and 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
        2018 financial highlights included:
• consolidated net revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion and consolidated operating income increased 52% to $2.0 billion, as compared to
consolidated net revenues of $7.0 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.3 billion in 2017; 
• revenues from digital online channels increased 6% to $5.8 billion, or 77% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $5.5 billion, or 78% of
consolidated net revenues, in 2017; 
• operating mar gin was 26.5%, as compared to 18.7% in 2017; 
• cash flows from operating activities were approximately $1.79 billion, a decrease of 19%, as compared to $2.21 billion in 2017; 
• consolidated net income increased to $1.8 billion, as compared to $273 million in 2017, which included significant discrete tax-related impacts in
both 2017 and 2018—refer to Consolidated Results discussion below for details; and 
• diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.35, as compared to $0.36 in 2017.
        Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the
transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service
periods, which are generally less than a year . Net revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018, include net ef fects of $238 million and
$100 million, respectively , from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.

International Sales
        International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically
directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 55%, and 55% of our total consolidated net
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively . The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by
consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany , Italy , Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international
business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local
economies. Accordingly , our future results could be materially and adversely af fected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local
economies.
Operating Metrics
        The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.
Net Bookings
        We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services
sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net
revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.
        Net bookings was as follows (amounts in millions):

Table of Contents
2018 vs. 2017
        The increase in net bookings for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:
• higher net bookings from World of W arcraft , driven by World of W arcraft: Battle for Azer oth, which was released in August 2018, with no
comparable release in 2017; 
•higher net bookings from Call of Duty: WWII , which was released in November 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar eTM (which,
when referred to herein, is inclusive of Call of Duty: Modern W arfar e® Remaster ed), which was released in November 2016; 
• higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise, primarily due to in-game advertisements, increased monetization, and the launch of Candy
Crush Friends Saga , the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018; and 
• net bookings from the Spyro Reignited T rilogy , which was released in November 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.
        The increase was partially of fset by:
• lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2  in September 2017, with no comparable full-game release in
2018; 
• lower net bookings from Overwatch , which was released in May 2016; and 
• lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e, as compared to prior catalog releases.
2017 vs. 2016
        The increase in net bookings for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:
• higher net bookings from King titles, as 2017 included King net bookings for the full year , while 2016 only included King net bookings for the
partial period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and
features; 
• higher net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2 ; 
• higher net bookings from Call of Duty: WWII , as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e, the comparable 2016 title; 
• higher net bookings from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III , as compared to prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable
content pack, Zombies Chr onicles , which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of microtransactions; and 
•net bookings from Crash BandicootTM N. Sane T rilogy , which was released in June 2017.
        The increase was partially of fset by:
• lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e, as compared to the performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops III , the comparable 2015 title; 
• lower net bookings from Overwatch ; 
• lower net bookings from World of W arcraft , driven by the release of World of W arcraft: Legion™  in August 2016, with no comparable release in
2017; and 
•lower net bookings from the Skylanders® franchise, due to the release of Skylanders Imaginators  in October 2016, with no comparable release in
2017.

Monthly Active Users
        We monitor monthly active users ("MAUs") as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a
particular game in a given month. W e calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and
dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to
technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as
two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user .
        The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary
surge in MAUs. Accordingly , although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period
fluctuations may not be indicative of longer -term trends. The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for each of our reportable
segments (amounts in millions):
        Average MAUs increased by 1 1 million, or 3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase in Activision's average MAUs is driven by the Call of Duty franchise, due to the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4  in October 2018. The increase
in King's average MAUs is due to the launch of Candy Crush Friends Saga  in October 2018.
        Average MAUs decreased by 29 million, or 8%, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The year -over -year decrease in King's average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. King MAUs were
also negatively impacted by a King network outage resulting from changes made in the second quarter of 2018 by a third-party partner which inadvertently
impacted some users' ability to play and spend money in King games. The year -over -year decrease in Blizzard's average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for
Hearthstone  and Overwatch .
Management's Overview of Business T rends
Interactive Entertainment Growth, Including Mobile Gaming
        Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry . Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we
estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market
as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.
        Further , the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for
gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is
estimated to be lar ger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and

units have mobile ef forts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.
Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games
        Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable
content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emer ging opportunities to drive additional
engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our ef forts to
build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.
        For example, as part of our ef forts to take advantage of the esports opportunity , during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League,
the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, which completed its inaugural season in July 2018. During 2018, we also completed the
sale of eight additional teams, which are competing in the league's second season that began in February 2019.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises
        The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry . According to The NPD
Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018. Similarly , a significant portion of our revenues
historically has been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games have been responsible for a disproportionately high
percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty , Candy Crush, and W orld of W arcraft franchises, collectively , accounted for 58% of our consolidated net
revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for 2018.
        The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10
console franchises in the U.S. in 2018, all 10 are from established franchises. Similarly , according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store
per App Annie Intelligence as of December 2018, the top 10 mobile games have held such ranking for an average of 28 months.
        In addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for , our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those
franchises. Further , while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an ef fort to develop future top franchises. For example, in 2014, we
released Hearthstone , and in 2016, we released Overwatch . Additionally , to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence on the mobile
platform, in 2016 we acquired King.
        Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our , and the industry's,
revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly , our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors' top
franchises can significantly impact our performance.
Recurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality
        Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to of fer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more
consistently recurring and year -round model. Of fering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and
invest in new content throughout the year . This incremental content not only provides additional high-mar gin revenues, it can also increase player engagement.
Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly , are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.
41
Table of Contents
        While our business is shifting toward a year -round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. W e have
historically experienced our highest sales volume, particularly for Activision, in the calendar year -end holiday buying season. Following the acquisition of King,
which focuses on free-to-play games, which are generally less seasonal, and as we otherwise make the shift to a year -round model, less of our revenues are
generated during the fourth quarter . For our reportable segments, the aggregate percentage of our revenue represented by the fourth quarter in 2018 was 39%, as
compared to 52% in 2013.
Outlook
        In 2019, we expect to have a lighter slate of full game releases than in 2018. W e plan to release our latest Call of Duty game in the second half of 2019,
along with Sekir o: Shadows Die T wice and Crash T eam Racing Nitr o-Fueled  in the first half of 2019. In addition, we expect to deliver ongoing content for our
various franchises, including continued in-game content for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 , expansion packs for Hearthstone , and in-game events for Overwatch .
Overall, we expect lower revenues and earnings per share in 2019 as compared to 2018.
        We will also continue to invest in new opportunities that we think have the potential to drive our growth over the long-term, including building on our
advertising and esports initiatives.
Focusing Development Resour ces and Restructuring Plan
        In order to better capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, on February 12, 2019, the Company committed to a Board-authorized restructuring plan
under which the Company plans to refocus its resources on its lar gest opportunities and to remove unnecessary levels of complexity and duplication from certain
parts of the business. More specifically , we intend to:
• increase our investment in development for our lar gest, internally-owned franchises—across upfront releases, in-game content, mobile and
geographic expansion; 
• reduce certain non-development and administrative-related costs across our business; and 
• integrate our global and regional sales and "go-to-market," partnerships, and sponsorships capabilities across the business, which we believe will
enable us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater expertise and scale on behalf of our business units.
        We expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring char ges of approximately $150 million in 2019, related to severance, including, in many cases, above
legally required amounts (approximately 65% of the aggregate char ge), facilities costs (approximately 20% of the aggregate char ge), and asset write-downs and
other costs (approximately 15% of the aggregate char ge). W e expect the majority of these char ges to be incurred in the first quarter of 2019, with most of the
balance expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2019. The total pre-tax char ge associated with the restructuring will be paid almost entirely in cash and the
outlays are expected to be incurred throughout 2019.

Consolidated Net Revenues
        The following table summarizes our consolidated net revenues and the increase/(decrease) in deferred revenues recognized (amounts in millions):
Consolidated net revenues
2018 vs. 2017
        The increase in consolidated net revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:
• an increase of $455 million in revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to (1) higher revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise,
driven by Destiny 2 , which was released in September 2017, with no comparable release in 2016, and by revenues recognized in connection with
the sale of our Destiny publishing rights to Bungie, (2) higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: WWII , which was released in November
2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e, which was released in November 2016, (3) higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty:
Black Ops 4 , which was released in October 2018, as compared to Call of Duty: WWII , and (4) revenues from the Spyro Reignited T rilogy , which
was released in November 2018, with no comparable release in 2017, partially of fset by lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Infinite
Warfar e, as compared to prior catalog releases; and 
• an increase of $105 million in revenues from King, despite the impact from the network outage in the second quarter of 2018 as discussed above,
primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise's higher revenues due to in-game advertisements, increased monetization, and the launch of Candy
Crush Friends Saga , the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018.
        The increase was partially of fset by a decrease of $74 million in revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to lower revenues recognized from
Overwatch , which was released in May 2016, partially of fset by higher revenues recognized from World of W arcraft , driven by World of W arcraft: Battle for
Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.
2017 vs. 2016
        The increase in consolidated net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:
• higher revenues from King titles, as 2017 included King revenues for the full year , while 2016 only included King revenues for the partial period
following the King Closing Date, as well as higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features; 
• higher revenues recognized from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III , as compared to prior catalog releases, driven by the
downloadable content pack, Zombies Chr onicles , which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of microtransactions; 
• revenues from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane T rilogy , which was released in June 2017; and 
• higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: WWII , as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e, the comparable 2016 title.

2015 title; and 
• lower revenues from the Skylanders franchise, due to the release of Skylanders Imaginators  in October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.
Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized
2018 vs. 2017
        The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $625 million in net deferred revenues
recognized from Activision, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by Destiny 2 , which was released in
September 2017, and its associated in-game content, with no comparable release in 2016.
        The increase was partially of fset by a decrease of $226 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to a net deferral of revenues
for World of W arcraft , driven by World of W arcraft: Battle for Azer oth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.
2017 vs. 2016
        The decrease in net deferred revenues recognized for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:
• a net deferral of revenues for the Destiny franchise, primarily due to Destiny 2 , as compared to net deferred revenues recognized in the comparable
prior period; and 
• a higher net deferral of revenues from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily due to the stronger performance of Call of Duty: WWII  in the fourth
quarter of 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e in the fourth quarter of 2016.
        The decrease was partially of fset by:
• net deferred revenues recognized from Overwatch  in 2017, as compared to a net deferral of revenues in 2016 due to the release of Overwatch  in
May 2016; and 
• net deferred revenues recognized from World of W arcraft  in 2017, as compared to a net deferral of revenues in 2016 due to the release of World of
Warcraft: Legion  in August 2016.
Foreign Exchange Impact
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $102 million, a positive impact of $42 million, and a negative impact of $81 million on
Activision Blizzard's consolidated net revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively , as compared to the same periods in the previous year . The changes are
primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.
Operating Segment Results
        Currently , we have three reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our
operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Of ficer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment
performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-
based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses,
and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities,

and financings; certain restructuring costs; and certain other non-cash char ges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating
segment basis, and accordingly , no disclosure is made with respect thereto.
        Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal or ganizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and
the availability of separate financial information. W e do not aggregate operating segments.

Cost of Revenues—Pr oduct Sales :
2018 vs. 2017
        The slight decrease in product costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $20 million in product costs from Activision,
primarily related to the absence of title releases for the Guitar Hero® and Skylanders franchises, which was partially of fset by higher product costs from our lower
margin Distribution business due to increased product sales.
        The increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due
to an increase of $89 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to higher software amortization and royalties for (1) the

lower software amortization and royalties from Call of Duty: WWII , as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite W arfar e, which was released in November 2016.
2017 vs. 2016
        Product costs for 2017, were comparable to 2016, primarily due to lower product costs from the Skylanders franchise as there was no new release in 2017,
offset by higher product costs resulting from the increased revenues of our relatively lower -margin Distribution business.
        The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due
to:
• lower software amortization associated with Guitar Her o Live , which was released in October 2015; 
• lower software amortization from Overwatch , which was released in May 2016; and 
• lower software amortization from the Skylanders franchise as there was no new release in 2017.

2018 vs. 2017
        The increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to higher personnel, facilities, and equipment costs
of $50 million associated with our esports broadcasting operations and online games.
        The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2018, as
compared to 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $121 million in amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired as part of our
acquisition of King. The decrease was partially of fset by an increase of $35 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to the
release of expansions for Destiny 2.
2017 vs. 2016
        The increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to platform provider fees associated with the
increase in revenues from King.
        Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2017 were comparable to 2016.
Product Development (amounts in millions)
2018 vs 2017
        The increase in product development costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $101 million in personnel and external
developer costs to support existing and upcoming title releases. The higher costs were partially of fset by an increase of $68 million in capitalization of software
development costs due to the increased costs previously noted and the timing of game development cycles.

Table of Contents
2017 vs 2016
        The increase in product development costs for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:
• higher Blizzard product development costs resulting from lower capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game
development cycles; and 
• increased product development costs for King, as 2017 included King's costs for a full year , while 2016 only included King's costs for the partial
period following the King Closing Date.
Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions)
2018 vs. 2017
        The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:
• a decrease of $263 million in amortization of the customer base intangible asset acquired as part of our acquisition of King, as the asset was fully
amortized during the first quarter of 2018; and 
• a decrease of $49 million in marketing spending and personnel costs, primarily associated with (1) the Destiny franchise, due to the release of
Destiny 2  in September 2017, with no comparable full-game release in 2018, (2) the Bubble W itch franchise, as Bubble W itch 3 SagaTM was
released during the first quarter of 2017, and (3) Overwatch , partially of fset by an increases in marketing spending and personnel costs for the
Candy Crush franchise, which had the release of Candy Crush Friends Saga  in October 2018.
2017 vs. 2016
        The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:
• higher sales and marketing costs for the Destiny franchise, given the release of Destiny 2  in September 2017; and 
• increased amortization of the customer base intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition and increased sales and marketing costs to support
King's titles, as 2017 included a full year of costs, while 2016 only included King's costs for the partial period following the King Closing Date.
General and Administrative (amounts in millions)
2018 vs. 2017
        The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $65 million in personnel costs
(including stock-based compensation expense), professional fees, and facilities costs to support the growth of our existing business and adjacent areas of
opportunity .

2017 vs. 2016
        The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:
• increased personnel costs, including stock compensation expenses, to support the growth in our business and adjacent areas of opportunity; 
• the inclusion of a non-cash accounting char ge to reclassify certain losses included in our cumulative translation adjustments into earnings due to
the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities, with no comparable activity in 2016; 
• restructuring char ges, primarily severance costs, incurred in 2017 with no comparable activity in 2016; and 
• higher foreign currency transaction losses.
        The increase is partially of fset by lower transaction costs as 2016 included the King Acquisition.

2018 vs. 2017
        The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:
• an increase of $41 million in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates as
compared to the prior -year period; and 
• a decrease of $22 million in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations due to our lower
total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities.
2017 vs. 2016
        The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to our lower total outstanding debt and lower
interest rates on our current debt instruments as a result of our refinancing activities in 2016 and 2017. See further discussion below under "Liquidity and Capital
Resources."

Table of Contents
        For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1.88 billion, $1.15 billion, and
$1.11 billion, respectively , and our income tax expense was $64 million (or a 3% ef fective tax rate), $878 million (or a 76% ef fective tax rate), and $140 million
(or a 13% ef fective tax rate), respectively . Our full year 2018 ef fective tax rate of 3% is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to one-time tax
benefits related to the U.S. T ax Reform Act (discussed further below), earnings taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of excess tax
benefits from shared-based payments, and research and development ("R&D") credits, partially of fset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax
positions.
        In 2018, 2017, and 2016, our U.S. income before income tax expense was $432 million, $185 million, and $228 million, respectively , and comprised 23%,
16%, and 21%, respectively , of our consolidated income before income tax expense. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our foreign income before income tax expense was
$1,445 million, $966 million, and $878 million, respectively , and comprised 77%, 84%, and 79%, respectively , of our consolidated income before income tax
expense.
        In 2018, 2017 and 2016, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate,
lowered our ef fective tax rate by 1 1 percentage points, 24 percentage points, and 22 percentage points, respectively . The decrease in the foreign rate dif ferential is
due to the reduction of U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.
        The overall ef fective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction,
applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and
variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or loss.
IRS Closing Agr eement
        On June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing
arrangements for tax periods starting in 2009 (the "Closing Agreement"). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the
second quarter of 2018 and consisted of a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized
$185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary
adjustments. The Closing Agreement resulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which federal tax payments of
$334 million were made in October 2018.
        We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than
not" to be realized in the future. T o make that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence
available. As of December 31, 2017, we had a deferred tax asset for California research and development credit carryforwards ("CA R&D Credits"), which can be
carried forward indefinitely . The Closing Agreement impacts historical and prospective filings in certain states, including California, and after considering the
impact of the Closing Agreement on its prospective California taxable income, we determined that our remaining CA R&D Credits no longer met the threshold of
more likely than not to be realized in the future. As such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $61 million. W e will
reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance.

U.S. T ax Reform Act
        On December 22, 2017, the U.S. T ax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. T ax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate
from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries (the "T ransition T ax").
        On December 22, 2017, the SEC staf f issued Staf f Accounting Bulletin No. 1 18 ("SAB 1 18"), which provides guidance on how to account for the ef fects of
the U.S. T ax Reform Act under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740. SAB 1 18 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the ef fects of
the U.S. T ax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year , until accounting is complete.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts of $636 million for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 1 18. In
addition, as of December 31, 2017, we no longer considered the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign
subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.
        In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis of the ef fect of the U.S. T ax Reform Act. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an
additional tax benefit of $285 million for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act. This is primarily related to the election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect
to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to global intangible low-taxed income ("GIL TI") and the adjustment for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax
assets and liabilities as a result of the U.S. corporate income tax rate reduction. The aggregate U.S. T ax Reform Act impact for 2017 and 2018 is a net tax expense
of $351 million, which consists of a $570 million tax expense related to the T ransition T ax, partially of fset by a net benefit of $219 million, mainly related to the
adoption of GIL TI deferred tax accounting and remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
        Further analysis of the dif ferences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated ef fective tax rate, as well as other information about our
income taxes, is provided in Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Exchange Impact
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $68 million, a positive impact of $27 million, and a positive impact of $10 million on Activision
Blizzard's consolidated operating income in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively . The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to the euro and British pound and its impact on our foreign operating income.
Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
        We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business
and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance
of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.4 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility , will
be suf ficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity , which are available to us to fund cash
outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.
        As of December 31, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 billion, as compared to
$3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Following the enactment of the U.S. T ax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings,
61
Table of Contents
we no longer consider these available cash balances, which primarily consist of undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be
indefinitely reinvested.
        Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally
highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. W e consider , on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder
value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions
may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)
 
Net Cash Pr ovided by Operating Activities
        The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale of our products
and services. These collections are typically partially of fset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments
for customer service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments
for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.
2018 vs 2017
        Net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $1.79 billion, as compared to $2.21 billion for 2017. The decrease was primarily due to:
• higher tax payments, primarily due to payments in the U.S.; and 
• changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.
        The decrease was partially of fset by higher net income in 2018 as compared to 2017.

Table of Contents
2017 vs 2016
        Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $2.21 billion, as compared to $2.16 billion for 2016. The increase was primarily due to:
• increased earnings after excluding the ef fects of char ges due to impacts from the U.S. T ax Reform Act, which did not result in current year cash
outflows, and other non-cash char ges for depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expenses; 
• a full year of King operating cash flows; and 
• changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.
        Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 included $145 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as compared to $209 million paid in 2016.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
        The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes
in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
2018 vs 2017
        Net cash used in investing activities for 2018 was $230 million, as compared to $207 million for 2017. The increase in the cash used in investing activities
was primarily due to higher purchases of available-for -sale investments of $209 million for 2018, as compared to $135 million in 2017, partially of fset by:
• higher proceeds from maturities of available-for -sale investments of $1 16 million in 2018, as compared to $80 million in 2017; and 
• lower capital expenditures of $131 million in 2018, as compared to $155 million in 2017.
2017 vs 2016
        Net cash used in investing activities for 2017 was $207 million, as compared to $4.7 billion for 2016. The decrease in the cash used was primarily due to
cash used for the King Acquisition in 2016, with no comparable transaction in 2017. The decrease was partially of fset by purchases of available-for -sale
investments, net of proceeds from maturities, of $55 million in 2017, with no comparable transactions in 2016.
Net Cash Pr ovided by (Used in) Financing Activities
        The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and
transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the
payment of dividends.
2018 vs 2017
        Net cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $2.0 billion, as compared to $624 million for 2017. The increase was primarily attributed to our debt
financing activities. For 2018, we had debt
63
Table of Contents
repayments, inclusive of premium payments, of $1.8 billion, as compared to net debt repayments of $500 million for 2017. The increase in cash used in financing
activities was further impacted by:
• lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $99 million for 2018, as compared to $178 million for 2017; 
• higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $94 million for 2018, as compared to $56 million for 2017; and 
• higher dividends paid of $259 million for 2018, as compared to $226 million for 2017.
2017 vs 2016
        Net cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $624 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $500 million for 2016. The
changes were primarily attributed to our debt financing activities. For 2017, we had net debt repayments of $500 million, as compared to approximately
$700 million of net debt proceeds, inclusive of a premium payment, for 2016. The cash flows used in financing activities for 2017, were partially of fset by:
• higher proceeds from stock option exercises in 2017 of $178 million, as compared to $106 million for 2016; and 
• lower tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units in 2017 of $56 million, as compared to $1 15 million in 2016.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $31 million, a positive impact of $76 million, and a negative impact of $56 million on our cash
and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively . The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro and British pound.
Debt
        As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $2.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively , bearing interest at a weighted
average rate of 3.18% and 3.58%, respectively . During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had the following significant activity associated with our debt
instruments:
• on August 16, 2018, using available cash on hand, we redeemed the $750 million of outstanding 2023 Notes in full at a redemption price equal to
(1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus (2) a "make-whole" premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023
Notes and (3) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, resulting in a "Loss on extinguishment of debt" recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium payments of $25 million and a write-of f of unamortized discount and deferred
financing costs of $8 million; 
• on August 24, 2018, using available cash on hand, we made a voluntary prepayment of $990 million to fully repay and extinguish our outstanding
term loans resulting in a write-of f of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $7 million, which is included in "Loss on
extinguishment of debt" in the consolidated statement of operations; and 
• on August 24, 2018, we also entered into the seventh amendment to our Credit Agreement which, among other things, replaced our prior revolving
credit facility of $250 million with a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, which is scheduled to mature
on August 24, 2023.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
        At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as
"structured finance" or "special purpose" entities, established for the purpose of facilitating of f-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future ef fect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity , capital expenditures, or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that af fect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could dif fer from those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed
throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies af fect our reported and expected
financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with
financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the ef fect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting
policies, estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.
Adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
        In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("F ASB") issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard
replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic, eliminating all industry-specific guidance and providing a unified model to determine when and how
revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new
accounting standard and related amendments. As a result, we have updated our accounting policy disclosures for revenue recognition herein. Refer to Note 3 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and see "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements"
below for further details on the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
        We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile platforms,
as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property . Our products span various genres, including first-person shooter , action/adventure, role-playing,
strategy , and "match three." W e primarily of fer the following products and services:
• full games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for the console or PC platform; 
• downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game; 
• microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and 
• subscriptions to players in our W orld of W arcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content.
66
Table of Contents
        When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we
expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.
        We determine revenue recognition by:
• identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 
• identifying the performance obligations in each contract; 
• determining the transaction price; 
• allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and 
• recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.
        Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we
recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer . For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize
revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay . Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed
at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer , such as sales and value-added taxes.
        Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to
90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition dif fers from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the
effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our
customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.
Product Sales
        Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. W e recognize revenues from the sale of our
products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied.
        Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as variable
consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each
reporting period as additional information becomes available.
        Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the
transaction price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for
distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's national circular ad, are recorded as "Sales and marketing" expense
when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service.
Products with Online Functionality
        For our software products that include both of fline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant online functionality ,
such as for most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online functionality are distinct
and separable. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on,
67
Table of Contents
including downloadable content. If we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property separate from the online functionality , we
consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the transaction price for the license, since we do not generally sell the software license on a
standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance
obligations.
        We recognize revenue for arrangements that include both a license of intellectual property and separate online functionality when control of the license
transfers to our customers for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the license and ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the
transaction price allocable to the online functionality . Similarly , we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on these arrangements and recognize the costs as the
related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs, distribution costs, and software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.
Online Hosted Softwar e Arrangements
        For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, W orld of W arcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all gameplay
and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player . Similar to our software products with online functionality , these
arrangements may include other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online
hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.
Subscription Arrangements
        Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of W arcraft , which is playable through Blizzard's servers and is generally sold on a
subscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then
recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.
        Revenues attributable to the purchase of World of W arcraft  software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as "Product sales," whereas
revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."
Licensing Revenues
        In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees typically
pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license
of intellectual property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not
limited to, prior selling prices, prices char ged separately by other third-party vendors for similar service of ferings, and a cost-plus-mar gin approach. Based on the
allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the minimum guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual
property , (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates, and/or (3) ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified
future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the licensee.
68
Table of Contents
Other Revenues
        Other revenues primarily include revenues from downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions, and licensing of intellectual
property other than software to third-parties.
        Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from
these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues
when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency . Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues
when a player uses the virtual goods. W e categorize our virtual goods as either "consumable" or "durable." Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be
consumed by a specific player action; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our
performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly , we
recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is
satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period.
        Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third parties primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to
customers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term.
Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which may be
upfront or over time.
Significant Judgment ar ound Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
        Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered
distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in
the Call of Duty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game of fline, but also depend on a significant level of integration and
interdependency with the online functionality . In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should
be considered distinct and accounted for separately , or not distinct and accounted for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time.
Generally , for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a significant component of gameplay is available of fline, we
believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and the online functionality .
        Significant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a
discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. T o estimate the standalone selling price we
consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may of fer, competitor pricing to the extent
data is available, and costs to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit mar gin.
Estimated Service Period
        We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days
between players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-
average number of days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. W e also consider known online trends, the service periods of our
previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours. W e believe this
provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our
69
Table of Contents
customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective
and requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may dif fer from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in
the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than 12 months.
Principal Agent Considerations
        We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft's Xbox Games Store, Sony's PSN, the Apple App Store,
and the Google Play Store, to determine whether our revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we evaluate in
determining whether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:
• which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and 
• which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
        Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play
Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft's Xbox Games Store and
Sony's PSN.
Income T axes
        We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC T opic 740, the provision for
income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences attributable to dif ferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary dif ferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ef fect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. W e evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . For those assets that do not
meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.
        Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,
together with the tax ef fects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be suf ficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net
deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be char ged to tax expense in the period such
determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC T opic
740 and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our
business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.
        Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves
are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be dif ferent from that which is reflected in our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. W e adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate.
To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is dif ferent than the amounts recorded, such dif ferences will
70
Table of Contents
impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve
provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
        Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by: (1) changes in the mix of earnings in countries with dif fering
statutory tax rates, (2) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (3) tax ef fects of nondeductible compensation; (4) tax costs related to
intercompany realignments; (5) dif ferences between amounts included in our tax filings and the estimate of such amounts included in our tax expenses;
(6) changes in accounting principles; or (7) changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles or interpretations, including fundamental changes
to the tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in
the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including
the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to
the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. W e regularly assess the likelihood of
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes
from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
        As further described in "Consolidated Results" above, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. T ax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. T ax Reform Act, among other
things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-
time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
        On December 22, 2017, the SEC staf f issued SAB 1 18, which provided guidance on how to account for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act under ASC
740. SAB 1 18 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment
during a measurement period of up to one year , until accounting is complete. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to determine the ef fects of
the U.S. T ax Reform Act. As a result, we made an election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to GIL TI.
Allowances for Returns and Price Protection
        We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions,
and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent
reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are suf ficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to
prevent excess inventory in the channel. W e benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.
        We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer -term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and
payment terms, and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. W e may also consider other factors, including achievement of sell-
through performance tar gets, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory , and other market factors.
71
Table of Contents
        Significant management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenues must be made and used when establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. W e estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and
acceptance of our products by the end consumer . The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title:
historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life
cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-
hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the
performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality ,
and sales strategy .
        Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However , actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our
allowance estimates due to a number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title; the release in the same period of a similarly
themed title by a competitor; or technological obsolescence due to the emer gence of new hardware platforms. There may be material dif ferences in the amount
and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's
assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2018 allowance for sales
returns, price protection, and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately $2 million.
Software Development Costs
        Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for
internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are
determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the
completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological
feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and
it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe
capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses."
Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts
related to software development which are not capitalized are char ged immediately to "Product development."
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization
period of six months to approximately two years.
        We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods,
the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods,
recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product
performance include:
72
Table of Contents
historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to
its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.
        Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised
forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be
lower than originally estimated in any given quarter , which could result in an impairment char ge. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and timing of
expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.
Fair V alue Estimates
        The preparation of financial statements often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present in our consolidated financial
statements. W ithout an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several
assumptions that are inherently dif ficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.
        There are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or
comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for
example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to
replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using
the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to: (1) the potential future cash
flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows; (3) the time value of money
associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (that is, the risk premium).
Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently dif ficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income
approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a
significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small
change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value
assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:
Business Combinations.
        Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair value. Our assessment of the estimated fair value
of each of these can have a material ef fect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Furthermore, a change in
the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. Often
determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset, the expected cost to extinguish the
liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in-process technology . Such estimates are
inherently dif ficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements.
73
Table of Contents
Assessment of Impairment of Definite-lived Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets.
        We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances (referred to as a
"triggering event") indicate a potential impairment exists. W e consider certain events and circumstances in determining whether a triggering event has occurred
that could indicate the carrying value of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, may not be recoverable, including, but not limited
to: (1) significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; (2) significant changes in the use of the assets; (3) significant negative industry or
economic trends; (4) a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and (5) changes in our business strategy . If it is determined that a
triggering event has occurred, we determine if an impairment exists based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and
ultimate disposition of the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying values of the related asset group, an impairment exists and the
impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the group's assets exceeds the fair value of the asset group. W e did not record an
impairment char ge to any of our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018, 2017, or 2016.
Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.
        We are required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and, if current events or circumstances require,
on an interim basis. ASC T opic 350 provides companies an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before performing a quantitative two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. W e perform our
impairment test for each reporting unit as part of our annual impairment test performed as of December 31. The first step of the quantitative test measures for
impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair
value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.
        To determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments
and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating mar gins used to
calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions.
These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market growth, our market share and costs are
based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, as well as on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are
using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment char ges. W e base our fair value estimates
on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may dif fer from those estimates.
        In determining the fair value of our significant reporting units—namely Activision, Blizzard, and King—we assumed discount rates ranging from 9.0% to
9.5% and terminal growth rates of 0.0% to 3.0%, depending on the reporting unit and its specific characteristics and risk profiles. Based on our quantitative
evaluation, we determined the estimated fair value of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2018. Changes in our
assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result
in future impairment char ges.
74
Table of Contents
        We test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2018, 2017, and
2016, we concluded that no impairment had occurred and that no impairment was reasonably likely to occur . In determining the fair value of these trade names,
we assumed a discount rate of 9.5%, and royalty saving rates of approximately 1.5%. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which
will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment char ges.
Share-Based Payments
        We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation expense for a given
grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based
payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates.
        We generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is af fected by our stock price, as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors.
        We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant,
reduced by the present value of the estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock units holder will not participate. Certain
restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For
performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. W e
amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately
vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology
and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte
Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility
that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock units at the
date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However , the number of shares that ultimately vest can
vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.
        For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
        As discussed in Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in May 2014, the F ASB
issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments
(collectively , the "new revenue accounting standard"), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally , we elected to apply the new revenue accounting
standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the
aggregate ef fect of all modifications when (1) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and
(3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. W e recognized the cumulative ef fect of initially applying the new
revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be
reported under the accounting standards in ef fect for those periods. The cumulative ef fect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018, was
$88 million.
        The most significant impacts of the new revenue accounting standard for us are:
• The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor -specific objective evidence
("VSOE") for unspecified futur e updates and ongoing online services pr ovided.   Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered
elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly , we are required to recognize as
revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated
service period, as previously required. This dif ference in accounting primarily impacts revenues from most of the titles within our Call of Duty
franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. The amount of
revenue recognized upon delivery of games to our customers is analyzed on a title-by-title basis and may change in the future. For example, the
entire sales price from our Call of Duty: Black Ops 4  release is being recognized ratably over an estimated service period, as the gameplay has an
increased focus towards the online competitive and cooperative game modes with no single-player campaign mode. Many of our other franchises,
such as Overwatch, W orld of W arcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under
the new standard is relatively unchanged; and 
• The accounting for certain of our softwar e licensing arrangements.   While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may dif fer on a
contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the
new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.
        For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, including the impacts to our consolidated balance
sheet and statement of operations, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash
        In November 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires
that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included
with "Cash and cash equivalents" when reconciling the beginning-of-period and
76
Table of Contents
end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should
be applied retrospectively .
        We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new
standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 3 of the notes to
the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for impacts on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2016.
Derivatives and Hedging
        In August 2017, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge
accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the ef fects of hedging instruments and hedged items in
the financial statements, and includes certain tar geted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedge's
effectiveness. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. W e adopted the standard during the
first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Y et Adopted
Leases
        In February 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP  guidance on this
topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a
right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are lar gely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will
be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability , subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives
received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense
pattern. The standard is ef fective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Adoption guidance provides
for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the ef fective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and
therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.
        This standard is ef fective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2019, and we will report our adoption in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. Upon
adoption, we will elect to apply the available transition practical expedients, including the optional adoption method discussed above. W e estimate the impact of
adoption to result in the establishment of lease liabilities of approximately $275 million to $325 million, with a similar corresponding impact to total assets.
Additionally , we expect that the new disclosure requirements will require us to design and implement additional internal controls over financial reporting, and we
are in process of adjusting our processes and internal controls in preparation for adopting the new standard.
Item 7A.    QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
        Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates.
77
Table of Contents
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
        We transact business in many dif ferent foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary
currencies include euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. T o the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens
against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and
cash flows from our international operations. Similarly , our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international
operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United
States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar , may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our
business. W e monitor currency volatility throughout the year .
        To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings and our foreign currency
risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts,
principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year . The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are
large and reputable commercial or investment banks.
        The fair values of our foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the
period.
        We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
        For a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges ("Cash Flow Hedges")
        The total gross notional amounts and fair values of our Cash Flow Hedges are as follows (amounts in millions):
        At December 31, 2018, our Cash Flow Hedges have remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally , $11 million of net realized but unrecognized
gains are recorded within "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" at December 31, 2018, for Cash Flow Hedges that had settled but were deferred and
will be amortized into earnings, along with the associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.

        The amount of pre-tax net realized gains (losses) associated with our Cash Flow Hedges that were reclassified out of "Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss)" and into earnings was as follows (amounts in millions):
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
        The total gross notional amounts and fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges are as follows (amounts in millions):
        For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in "General and
administrative expenses" and were not material.
        In the absence of hedging activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10% would
have resulted in a theoretical decline of our net income of approximately $140 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign
currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however , all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in this manner and actual results may dif fer
materially .
Interest Rate Risk
        Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, as our outstanding debt is all at fixed rates. Our
investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities. Because short-
term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash
equivalents, or short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer -term securities. Conversely , the fair value of such a portfolio
is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer -term securities. At December 31, 2018, our $4.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents was
comprised primarily of money market funds.
        The Company has determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018, there was no material interest rate risk
exposure to the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity as of that date.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
        Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the "Exchange Act are designed to reasonably
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive of ficer and
principal financial of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set
forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error
and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions,
which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all
possible future events.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
        Our management, with the participation of our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, has evaluated the ef fectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures at December 31, 2018, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive of ficer and principal
financial of ficer concluded that, at December 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were ef fective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a
timely basis, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-
15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, conducted
an evaluation of the ef fectiveness, as of December 31, 2018, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was ef fective as of December 31, 2018.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
        The ef fectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
        Our management, with the participation of our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive of ficer and principal
financial of ficer concluded that, at December 31, 2018, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent
fiscal quarter that have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm 
        To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2),
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). W e also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Contr ol—Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).
        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, ef fective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Contr ol—Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the
COSO.
Change in Accounting Principles
        As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with
customers and the manner in which it accounts for restricted cash in the statement of cash flows in 2018.
Basis for Opinions
        The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
        We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether ef fective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
        Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
F-1
Table of Contents
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
        A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
1. Description of Business
        Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. W e develop and distribute content and
services on video game consoles, personal computers ("PC"s), and mobile devices. W e also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television
content based on our intellectual property . The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company ," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision
Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
        The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008
business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), V ivendi S.A. ("V ivendi"), and V ivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of V ivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.
        The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol "A TVI."
The King Acquisition
        On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company ("King"), by
purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"), as further described in Note 23. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of
King commencing on the King Closing Date.
Our Segments
        Based upon our or ganizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, as follows:
(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.

for the console platforms. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing
software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our
internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.
        Activision's key product franchise is Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms.
        In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. ("Bungie") to publish games in the Destiny franchise. Ef fective December 31,
2018, Activision and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision
agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie's assumption of on-going customer obligations of
Activision. Going forward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise. As a result of the agreement to terminate
the relationship, the Company recognized revenues of $164 million and GAAP operating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation and Presentation
        The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company . All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that af fect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could dif fer from these estimates
and assumptions.
        Certain reclassifications have been made to prior -year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
        The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, for additional evidence
relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
        We consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be "Cash and
cash equivalents."
Investment Securities
        Investments in debt securities designated as available-for -sale are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if
available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses of the Company's
available-for -sale debt securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of "Other comprehensive income (loss)."
        Investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities of less than one year are normally classified within "Other current assets."
In addition, investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified within "Other current assets" if they are highly liquid in nature and represent the
investment of cash that is available for current operations.
        The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses reflected in "Interest and other
expense (income), net" in our consolidated statements of operations.
        Investments in equity securities which are not accounted for under the equity method and for which there is not a readily determinable fair value are carried
at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investment of the same
issuer .
Financial Instruments
        The carrying amounts of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Accounts receivable, net of allowances," "Accounts payable," and "Accrued expenses and other
liabilities" approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts. Our investments in U.S. treasuries, government agency securities, and corporate
bonds, if any , are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such
F-10

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
securities, if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics.
        The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies,
subjecting us to foreign currency risk. T o mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and
earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter
into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year . The counterparties for
our currency derivative contracts are lar ge and reputable commercial or investment banks.
        We assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("F ASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") T opic 815 to
determine whether such derivatives should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the
prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. W e report the fair value of these contracts within "Other current assets,"
"Accrued expense and other liabilities," "Other assets," or "Other liabilities," as applicable, in our consolidated balance sheets.
        We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
        For foreign currency forward contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, changes in the estimated fair value of these
derivatives are recorded within "General and administrative expenses" and "Interest and other expense, net" in our consolidated statements of operations,
consistent with the nature of the underlying transactions.
        For foreign currency forward contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, we assess the ef fectiveness of these
cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing basis and determine if the hedges are ef fective at providing of fsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
The Company records the changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and subsequently reclassifies the
related amount of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within "General and administrative" or "Net revenues" when the hedged item
impacts earnings, consistent with the nature and timing of the underlying transactions. Cash flows from these foreign currency forward contracts are classified in
the same category as the cash flows associated with the hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows. W e measure hedge inef fectiveness, if any , and if
it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly ef fective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.
Concentration of Credit Risk
        Our concentration of credit risk relates to depositors holding the Company's cash and cash equivalents and customers with significant accounts receivable
balances.
        Our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market funds consisting of short-term, high-quality debt instruments issued by governments
and governmental or ganizations, financial institutions and industrial companies.

        Our customer base includes retailers and distributors, including mass-market retailers, first party digital storefronts, consumer electronics stores, discount
warehouses, and game specialty stores in the U.S. and other countries worldwide. W e perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain
allowances for potential credit losses. W e generally do not require collateral or other security from our customers.
        For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three customers—Apple, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Inc. ("Sony"), and Google—who accounted for
15%, 13%, and 1 1%, respectively , of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three customers—Apple, Sony , and Google—who accounted
for 16%, 14%, and 10%, respectively , of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had two customers—Sony and Apple—who each accounted for
13% of net revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in the respective periods discussed above.
        We had two customers—Sony and NetEase, Inc.—who accounted for 15% and 12%, respectively , of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2018.
We had three customers—Sony , Microsoft Corporation's ("Microsoft"), and Apple—who accounted for 17%, 14%, and 10%, respectively , of consolidated gross
receivables at December 31, 2017. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated gross receivables in the respective periods discussed above.
Inventories and Allowances for Obsolescence
        Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor , and freight-in costs and are stated at the lower of
cost (weighted-average method) or net realizable value. Inventories are relieved on a weighted-average cost method.
        We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels and will write down inventory on-hand based on excess or obsolete inventories,
determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the dif ference between the cost of the inventory and
net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently dif ficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a
loss recognition, a new , lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or
increase in that newly established basis.
Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses
        Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for
internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined
to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and
tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is
established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development
cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable
that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized
costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of
F-12
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned
are char ged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are char ged immediately
to "Product development."
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization
period of six months to approximately two years.
        Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software,
technology , music or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder ,
we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in multiple products over a number of years, or alternatively , for a single product. Prior to a product's
release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses." Capitalized intellectual property costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product
development" in the period of cancellation.
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization,
and intellectual property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed
property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to be released over a period
beyond one year , the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year .
        We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have
been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be
released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed
trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed
with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel
product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based. Further , as many of our capitalized intellectual property
licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain
qualitative factors, such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property , whether there are any future planned
theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property , and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property .
        Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised
forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in

the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter , which could result in an impairment
charge. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's
expectations.
Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
        We apply the practical expedient to expense, as incurred, costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year
or less for certain similar contracts in which commissions are paid to internal personnel or third parties. W e believe application of the practical expedient has a
limited ef fect on the amount and timing of cost recognition. T otal capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial as of December 31, 2018.
Long-Lived Assets
Property and Equipment.
        Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset (i.e., 25 to 33 years for
buildings, and 2 to 5 years for computer equipment, of fice furniture and other equipment). When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated
depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets.
        Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and is carried at cost. Acquired trade names are assessed as indefinite lived assets if there is no foreseeable
limits on the periods of time over which they are expected to contribute cash flows. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an
annual impairment test, as well as between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. W e perform our
annual impairment testing at December 31.
        Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our reporting units are the same as our
operating segments. W e test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the
recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is determined using an income approach based on discounted
cash flow models. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, we perform a second step to measure the
amount of the impairment, which is equal to the amount by which the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill after assessing the fair
value of each of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit. W e have determined that no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016
based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time.
        We test indefinite-lived acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. W e have determined that
no impairment has occurred at

December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of future
performance at this time.
        Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic
conditions, could result in future impairment char ges.
Amortizable Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets.
        Intangible assets subject to amortization are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the
economic benefits received.
        We evaluate the recoverability of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment exists. W e consider certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived
assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to expected
operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a
sustained period of time; and changes in our business strategy . If we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the undiscounted cash
flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group to determine whether an impairment exists. If an impairment is indicated based on a
comparison of the asset groups' carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of
the asset group exceeds its fair value. We did not record an impairment char ge to our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Revenue Recognition
        In May 2014, the F ASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP  guidance on this
topic, eliminating all industry-specific guidance and providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a
company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments
(collectively , the "new revenue accounting standard"). This is reflected in our significant accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition below . Refer to
Note 3 for the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
        We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile platforms,
as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property . Our products span various genres, including first-person shooter , action/adventure, role-playing,
strategy , and "match three." W e primarily of fer the following products and services:
• full games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for the console or PC platform; 
• downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game;
F-15
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
• microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and 
• subscriptions to players in our W orld of W arcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content.
        When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we
expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.
        We determine revenue recognition by:
• identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 
• identifying the performance obligations in each contract; 
• determining the transaction price; 
• allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and 
• recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.
        Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we
recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer . For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize
revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay . Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed
at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer , such as sales and value-added taxes.
        Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to
90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition dif fers from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the
effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our
customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.
Product Sales
        Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. W e recognize revenues from the sale of our
products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied.
        Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as variable
consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each
reporting period as additional information becomes available.
        Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the
transaction price of our products and are reflected
F-16
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for distinct goods or services received, such as the
appearance of our products in a customer's national circular ad, are recorded as "Sales and marketing" expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is
separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service.
Products with Online Functionality
        For our software products that include both of fline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant online functionality ,
such as for most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online functionality are distinct
and separable. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on, including downloadable content. If we determine that our software
products contain a license of intellectual property separate from the online functionality , we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate
the transaction price for the license, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other
products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations.
        We recognize revenue for arrangements that include both a license of intellectual property and separate online functionality when control of the license
transfers to our customers for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the license and ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the
transaction price allocable to the online functionality . Similarly , we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on these arrangements and recognize the costs as the
related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs, distribution costs, and software royalties, amortization, and
intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.
Online Hosted Softwar e Arrangements
        For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, W orld of W arcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all gameplay
and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player . Similar to our software products with online functionality , these
arrangements may include other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online
hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.
Subscription Arrangements
        Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of W arcraft , which is playable through Blizzard's servers and is generally sold on a
subscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then
recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.
        Revenues attributable to the purchase of World of W arcraft  software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as "Product sales," whereas
revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Licensing Revenues
        In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees typically
pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license
of intellectual property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not
limited to, prior selling prices, prices char ged separately by other third-party vendors for similar service of ferings, and a cost-plus-mar gin approach. Based on the
allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the minimum guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual
property , (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates, and/or (3) ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified
future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the licensee.
Other Revenues
        Other revenues primarily include revenues from downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions, and licensing of intellectual
property other than software to third-parties.
        Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from
these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues
when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency . Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues
when a player uses the virtual goods. W e categorize our virtual goods as either "consumable" or "durable." Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be
consumed by a specific player action; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our
performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly , we
recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is
satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period.
        Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third parties primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to
customers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term.
Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which may be
upfront or over time.
Significant Judgment ar ound Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
        Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered
distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in
the Call of Duty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game of fline, but also depend on a significant level of integration and
interdependency with the online functionality . In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should
be considered distinct and accounted for separately , or not distinct and
F-18
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
accounted for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally , for titles in which the software license is functional without the
online functionality and a significant component of gameplay is available of fline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the
intellectual property and the online functionality .
        Significant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a
discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. T o estimate the standalone selling price we
consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may of fer, competitor pricing to the extent
data is available, and costs to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit mar gin.
Estimated Service Period
        We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days
between players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-
average number of days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. W e also consider known online trends, the service periods of our
previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours. W e believe this
provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our
games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may dif fer from historical usage
patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less
than 12 months.
Principal Agent Considerations
        We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft's Xbox Games Store, Sony's PSN, the Apple App Store,
and the Google Play Store, to determine whether revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we evaluate in
determining whether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:
• which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and 
• which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
        Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play
Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft's Xbox Games Store and
Sony's PSN.

Allowances for Returns and Price Protection
        We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions,
and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent
reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are suf ficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to
prevent excess inventory in the channel. W e benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.
        We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer -term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and
payment terms and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. W e may also consider other factors, including achievement of sell-
through performance tar gets, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory , and other market factors.
        Significant management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenues must be made and used when establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. W e estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and
acceptance of our products by the end consumer , and record revenue for the transferred products in the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled.
The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres;
historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback;
industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-
hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the performance of competing titles. The relative
importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality , and sales strategy .
        Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However , actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our
allowance estimates due to a number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly
themed title by a competitor , or technological obsolescence due to the emer gence of new hardware platforms. There may be material dif ferences in the amount
and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's
assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection.

Contract Balances
        We generally record a receivable related to revenue when we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment, and record deferred revenue when
cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, even if amounts are refundable.
        The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balance. In estimating the allowance for
doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current
economic trends, and changes in our customers' payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain suf ficient credit insurance. Any
significant changes in any of these criteria would af fect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.
        Deferred revenue is comprised primarily of unearned revenue related to the sale of products with online functionality or online hosted arrangements. W e
typically invoice, and collect payment for , these sales at the beginning of the contract period and recognize revenue ratably over the estimated service period.
Deferred revenue also includes payments for: product sales pending delivery or activation; subscription revenues; licensing revenues with fixed minimum
guarantees; and other revenues for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.
        Refer to Note 12 for further information, including changes in deferred revenue during the period.
Shipping and Handling
        Shipping and handling costs consist primarily of packaging and transportation char ges incurred to move finished goods to customers. W e recognize all
shipping and handling costs as an expense in "Cost of revenues-product costs," including those incurred when control of the product has already transferred to the
customer .
Cost of Revenues
        Our cost of revenues consist of the following:
        Cost of r evenues—pr oduct sales:
(1) "Product costs"—includes the manufacturing costs of goods produced and sold. These generally include product costs, manufacturing royalties
(net of volume discounts), personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. W e generally recognize volume discounts when they are
earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones). 
(2) "Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the
capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to product sales
revenues.
F-21

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
        Cost of r evenues—subscription, licensing, and other r evenues:
(1) "Game operations and distribution costs"—includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, Internet bandwidth and server costs,
platform provider fee, and payment provider fees, along with costs to associated with our esports activities. 
(2) "Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released,
at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable
to subscription, licensing and other revenues.
Advertising Expenses
        We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising, which are deferred and char ged to expense when the
related advertisement is run for the first time. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $631 million, $708 million, and
$641 million, respectively , and are included in "Sales and marketing" in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income T axes
        We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC T opic 740, the provision for
income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences attributable to dif ferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary dif ferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ef fect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. W e evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . For those assets that do not
meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.
        We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. W e recognize interest
and penalties, if any , related to unrecognized tax benefits in "Income tax expense."
        On December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation known as the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "U.S. T ax Reform Act") was enacted in the United States. The U.S.
Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax
system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries ("T ransition T ax").
        On December 22, 2017, the SEC staf f issued Staf f Accounting Bulletin No. 1 18 ("SAB 1 18"), which provides guidance on how to account for the ef fects of
the U.S. T ax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 1 18 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act based on a
reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year ,

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
until accounting is complete. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to determine the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act. As a result, we made
an election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to global intangible low-taxed income ("GIL TI"). Refer to
Note 18 for further details regarding this policy election.
        Excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations and the tax ef fects of
exercised or vested awards are treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur .
Foreign Currency T ranslation
        All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries who have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate in ef fect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments
are reflected as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in shareholders' equity .
Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share
        "Basic (loss) earnings per common share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the periods presented. "Diluted earnings (loss) per common share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents. Common
stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options. However ,
potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be
anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.
        When we determine whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities, unvested share-based awards which
include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered to participate with common stock in undistributed earnings. W ith
participating securities, we are required to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share amounts under the two-class method. The two-class
method excludes from the earnings (loss) per common share calculation any dividends paid or owed to participating securities and any undistributed earnings
considered to be attributable to participating securities.
Share-Based Payments
        We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation expense for a given
grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based
payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates.
        We generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is af fected by our stock price, as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective
F-23
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
        We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant,
reduced by the present value of the estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock units holder will not participate. Certain
restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For
performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. W e
amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately
vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology
and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte
Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility
that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock units at the
date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However , the number of shares that ultimately vest can
vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.
        For share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a cumulative
catch-up adjustment for changes in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.
Loss Contingencies
        ASC T opic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. W e record an accrual
for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential
loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any
other amount within the range. Moreover , even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is
reasonably possible (i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse impacts on us.
3. Recently Issued Accounting Pr onouncements
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
Revenue r ecognition
        As noted in Note 2 above, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard ef fective January 1, 2018. W e utilized the modified retrospective method upon
adoption and as a result, the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in ef fect for those periods.
Additionally , we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified
before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate ef fect of all modifications when (1) identifying the

satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied
performance obligations. W e recognized the cumulative ef fect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings. The cumulative ef fect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings was $88 million (see our consolidated statements of changes in
shareholders' equity) and included the impact from the following adjustments to our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2018 (amounts in millions):
        The most significant impacts of the new revenue accounting standard for us are:
• The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor -specific objective evidence
("VSOE") for unspecified futur e updates and ongoing online services pr ovided.   Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered
elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly , we are required to recognize as
revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated
service period as previously required. This dif ference in accounting primarily impacts revenues from many of the titles within our Call of Duty
franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. The amount of
revenue recognized upon delivery of games to our customers is analyzed on a title-by-title basis and may change in the future. For example, the
entire sales price from our Call of Duty: Black Ops 4  release is being recognized ratably over an estimated service period, as the gameplay has an
increased focus towards the online competitive and cooperative game modes with no single-player campaign mode. Many of our other franchises,
such as Overwatch, W orld of W arcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under
the new standard is relatively unchanged; and 
• The accounting for certain of our softwar e licensing arrangements.   While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may dif fer on a
contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the
new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.

        Adoption of the new revenue accounting standard had no impact to net cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing activities in our consolidated
statement of cash flows.
Financial Instruments
        In January 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard,
among other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and
to recognize any changes in fair value in net income. For investments in entities without a readily determinable fair value, the new standard provides for a
measurement alternative that can be elected to account for the investments at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer . The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity
investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and the guidance should
be applied by means of a cumulative-ef fect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The guidance related to equity
investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) is applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of
adoption. W e adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018, and elected to apply the measurement alternative for our investments without a readily
determinable fair value. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash
        In November 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires
that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included
with "Cash and cash equivalents" when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new
standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively .
        We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new
standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, there is a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows, as this period included, as an investing activity , the $3.6 billion
movement in restricted cash resulting from the release of cash in escrow to complete the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance is
included in the beginning and ending cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, is not included as an investing activity in the statement of
cash flows. See a summary of impacts on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 as follows (in millions):
Derivatives and Hedging
        In August 2017, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge
accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the ef fects of hedging instruments and hedged items in
the financial statements, and includes certain tar geted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedge's
effectiveness. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. W e adopted the standard during the
first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

Leases
        In February 2016, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP  guidance on this
topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a
right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are lar gely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will
be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability , subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives
received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense
pattern. The standard is ef fective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Adoption guidance provides
for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the ef fective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and
therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.
        This standard is ef fective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2019, and we will report our adoption in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. Upon
adoption, we will elect to apply the available transition practical expedients, including the optional adoption method discussed above. W e estimate the impact of
adoption to result in the establishment of lease liabilities of approximately $275 million to $325 million, with a similar corresponding impact to total assets.
Additionally , we expect that the new disclosure requirements will require us to design and implement additional internal controls over financial reporting, and we
are in process of adjusting our processes and internal controls in preparation for adopting the new standard.
Goodwill
        In January 2017, the F ASB issued new guidance that eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if an entity for goes a Step 0 test, an entity
will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the
goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment char ge, if any , for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, and should be applied prospectively . Early adoption is permitted. The ef fect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal
year of adoption. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
Cloud Computing Arrangements
        In August 2018, the F ASB issued new guidance related to a customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement
(i.e. hosting arrangement) that is a service contract. The new guidance requires customers to capitalize implementation costs for these arrangements by applying
the same criteria that is utilized for existing internal-use software guidance. The capitalized costs are required to be amortized over the associated term of the
arrangement, generally on a straight-line basis, with amortization of these costs presented in the same financial statement line item as other costs associated with
the arrangement. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and can be applied retrospectively or prospectively . Early
adoption is permitted. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.

11. Fair V alue Measur ements
        The F ASB literature regarding fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of "observable inputs" and minimize the use of "unobservable inputs." The three
levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
• Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and 
• Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities,
including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

        During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in "General and
administrative expenses" and were not material.
Fair V alue Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis
        We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
        For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there were no impairment char ges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.
12. Deferr ed Revenues
        We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of the fulfillment of our associated performance obligations. The opening
balance of deferred revenues as of January 1, 2018 and the ending balance as of December 31, 2018, were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively , including our
current and non-current balances. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the additions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to cash payments
received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the reductions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to the recognition
of revenues upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2018,
$1.7 billion of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenues balance at the beginning of the period.
        As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of contracted revenues allocated to our unsatisfied performance obligations is $2.9 billion, which includes
our deferred revenues balances and amounts to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. W e expect to recognize

from sales-based royalty license revenue in excess of the contractual minimum guarantee.
13. Debt
Credit Facilities
        At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding term loans "A" of approximately $990 million (the "2017 TLA") and $250 million available under a revolving
credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement entered into on October 1 1, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the "Credit Agreement").
        On August 24, 2018, using available cash on hand, we made a voluntary prepayment of $990 million to fully repay and extinguish the 2017 TLA. As a
result, we wrote-of f unamortized discount and financing costs of $7 million, which are included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the consolidated statement
of operations. On August 24, 2018, we also entered into the seventh amendment (the "Amendment") to our Credit Agreement. The Amendment, among other
things: (1) provided for a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the "New Revolver"), which replaced our prior revolving
credit facility; (2) amended the Credit Agreement to remove mechanics related to the 2017 TLA, which, as noted above, was repaid in full prior to the
effectiveness of the Amendment; and (3) eliminated or amended certain representations, warranties and covenants to reflect our current credit ratings.
        The New Revolver is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023. Borrowings under the New Revolver will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either
(1) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the London
Interbank Of fered Rate ("LIBOR") for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (2) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest
margin. LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and base rate will be subject to an ef fective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest mar gin for borrowings under
the New Revolver will range from 0.875% to 1.375% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0% to 0.375% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by
reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's credit ratings. Up to $50 million of the New Revolver may be used for letters of credit. T o date, we have not
drawn on the New Revolver .
        Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company's Consolidated T otal Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) not to exceed 3.75:1.00 (or , at the Company's option and for a limited period of time upon the consummation of a Qualifying Acquisition (as defined
in the Credit Agreement), 4.25:1.00). The Credit Agreement contains covenants customary for transactions of this type for issuers with similar credit ratings.
These include those restricting liens, debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries and certain fundamental changes, in each case with exceptions, including exceptions for
secured debt and debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Company , in each case up to an amount not exceeding 7.5% of T otal Assets (as defined in the Credit
Agreement). W e were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018.

Unsecured Senior Notes
        At December 31, 2017, we had the following unsecured senior notes outstanding:
• $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 that we issued on September 19, 2013 (the "2023 Notes"), in a private
offering made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"); 
• $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due
September 2026 (the "2026 Notes") that we issued on September 19, 2016, in a private of fering made in accordance with Rule 144A and
Regulation S under the Securities Act, and subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes in June 2017; and 
• $400 million of 2.6% unsecured senior notes due June 2022 (the "2022 Notes"), $400 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due June 2027 (the
"2027 Notes"), and $400 million of 4.5% unsecured senior notes due June 2047 (the "2047 Notes", and together with the 2021 Notes, the 2022
Notes, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes, and the 2027 Notes, the "Notes"), that we issued on May 26, 2017, in a public underwritten of fering.
        On July 17, 2018, we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to the holders of all of our outstanding 2023 Notes. Accordingly , on August 16, 2018, using
available cash on hand, we redeemed the 2023 Notes in full at a redemption price equal to (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus (2) a "make-
whole" premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and (3) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption of
the 2023 Notes resulted in a "Loss on extinguishment of debt" recorded in the consolidated statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium
payments of $25 million and a write-of f of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $8 million. All other Notes referred to above remained
outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
        The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu  in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future senior
indebtedness, including the New Revolver described above. The Notes are not secured and are ef fectively junior to any of the Company's existing and future
indebtedness that is secured to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions
in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain mer ger or consolidation
transactions. W e were in compliance with the terms of the Notes as of December 31, 2018.
        Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2021 Notes, the 2023 Notes, and the 2026 Notes, and payable
semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year for the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes. Accrued interest payable is recorded
within "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had accrued interest
payable of $15 million and $28 million, respectively , related to the Notes.
        We may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes prior to August 15, 2021, May 15, 2022,
June 15, 2026, March 15, 2027, and December 15, 2046, respectively , and in each case at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal

amount thereof plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Any redemption of all or a portion of the applicable class of note after the
applicable date would be at 100% of aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
        Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to of fer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These repurchase requirements are considered clearly and closely related to the Notes and are not
accounted for separately upon issuance.
Interest expense and financing costs
        Fees and discounts associated with the issuance of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying values, and are
amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within "Interest and other expense (income), net" in our consolidated statement of
operations.
        For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016: interest expense was $134 million, $150 million, and $197 million, respectively; amortization of
the debt discount and deferred financing costs was $6 million, $12 million, and $20 million, respectively .

13. Debt (Continued)
        As of December 31, 2018, the scheduled maturities and contractual principal repayments of our debt for each of the five succeeding years are as follows
(amounts in millions):
        On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayment of up to $1.8 billion of the company's outstanding debt during 2018. As of December 31,
2018, we had utilized this entire authorization to repay our 2017 TLA and redeem our 2023 Notes, as described above.
        Using Level 2 inputs (i.e., observable market prices in less-than-active markets) at December 31, 2018, the carrying values of the 2021 Notes and the 2022
Notes approximated their fair values, as the interest rates were similar to the current rates at which we could borrow funds over the selected interest periods. At
December 31, 2018, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes were $800 million, $376 million, and
$360 million, respectively .
        Using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2017, with the exception of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes, the carrying values of our debt instruments
approximated their fair values. At December 31, 2017, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes were $795 million and
$421 million, respectively .

14. Accumulated Other Compr ehensive Income (Loss) (Continued)
        Income taxes were not previously provided for foreign currency translation items, as these were considered indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Due to the U.S. T ax Reform Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we re-evaluated our indefinite reinvestment assertions and no longer consider these items to be
indefinite investments. The corresponding tax impact for this change in assertion was not material.
15. Operating Segments and Geographic Regions
        Currently , we have three reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our
operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Of ficer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment
performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-
based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses,
and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring costs; and certain other non-cash char ges. The CODM
does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly , no disclosure is made with respect thereto.
        Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal or ganizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and
the availability of separate financial information. W e do not aggregate operating segments.

effective date of the 2014 Plan, we had ceased making awards under our prior equity incentive plans (collectively , the "Prior Plans"), although such plans remain
in effect to the extent that they continue to govern outstanding awards.
        While the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our current share-based compensation program generally utilizes a
combination of options and restricted stock units. The majority of our options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a period of
three to five years, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. In addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be
equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on Nasdaq. Restricted stock units have time-
based vesting schedules, generally vesting in their entirety on an anniversary of the date of grant, or vest annually over a period of three to five years, and may
also be contingent on the achievement of specified performance measures.
        As of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of our
common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further , increased from time to time by: (1) the number of shares relating to
awards outstanding under any Prior Plan that: (i) expire, or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (ii) are settled in cash in lieu of
shares; or (iii) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (2) if the exercise price of any
option outstanding under any Prior Plans is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award outstanding under any Prior Plans are, satisfied by
withholding shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares already owned, the number
of shares equal to the withheld or transferred shares; and (3) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled in shares, a number of shares equal to the
difference between the total number of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares actually issued or transferred. As of
December 31, 2018, we had approximately 27 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection
with awards made under the 2014 Plan are generally issued as new stock issuances.
        Additionally , in connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding options and awards with respect to King shares that were unvested as of
the King Closing Date were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock. As part of the conversion, we
assumed King's equity incentive plan (the "King Plan") and amended the King Plan to convert it to a plan with respect to shares of the Company's common stock
for the King shares assumed. No future shares can be granted from the King Plan, but it continues to govern outstanding awards.
Fair V alue V aluation Assumptions
Valuation of Stock Options
        The fair value of stock options granted are principally estimated using a binomial-lattice model. The inputs in our binomial-lattice model include expected
stock price volatility , risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees' cancellations, exercise, and
post-vesting termination behavior . Statistical methods are used to estimate employee rank-specific termination rates.

        The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions, weighted average grant date fair value, and the range of expected stock price volatilities:
Expected life
        The expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of the binomial-lattice model and represents the weighted-average period the stock options
are expected to remain outstanding. A binomial-lattice model assumes that employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an
exercise multiple. The exercise multiple is based on historical employee exercise behaviors.
Volatility
        To estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we consider the implied volatility of exchange-traded options on our stock to estimate short-term
volatility , the historical volatility of our common shares during the option's contractual term to estimate long-term volatility , and a statistical model to estimate the
transition from short-term volatility to long-term volatility .
Risk-free interest rate
        As is the case for volatility , the risk-free interest rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual term. The risk-free interest rate, which is based on
U.S. T reasury yield curves, reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next ("forward rate").
Dividend yield
        The expected dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and expected future amount of dividend payouts.
        Share-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures dif fer from those
estimates.

16. Shar e-Based Payments (Continued)
Valuation of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")
        The fair value of the Company's RSU awards granted is principally based upon the closing price of the Company's stock price on the date of grant reduced
by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting.
Accuracy of Fair V alue Estimates
        We developed the assumptions used in the models above, including measures of employees' exercise and post-vesting termination behavior . Our ability to
accurately estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to accurately forecast
model inputs for as long as 10 years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility , risk-free rate, dividend yield, and
employee termination rates. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, the estimates that are produced by
this model may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller . Unfortunately , it is dif ficult to determine if this is the
case, as markets do not currently exist that permit the active trading of employee stock option and other share-based instruments.
Stock Option Activity
        Stock option activity is as follows:
        The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e. the dif ference between our closing stock price on the last
trading day of the period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the closing stock price is greater than the exercise price) that would
have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that date. This amount changes based on the market value of our stock.
The total intrinsic value of options actually exercised was $196 million, $372 million, and $161 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016,
respectively . The total grant date fair value of options vested was $45 million, $47 million, and $40 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and
2016, respectively .

        At December 31, 2018, $84 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.20 years.
RSU Activity
        We grant RSUs, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock. V esting for RSUs is contingent upon the holders' continued employment
with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). Also, certain of our performance-based RSUs
include a range of shares that may be released at vesting which are above or below the tar geted number of RSUs based on actual performance relative to the grant
date performance measure. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested RSUs will be forfeited. Upon vesting of the RSUs, we may withhold shares otherwise
deliverable to satisfy tax withholding requirements.
        The following table summarizes our RSU activity with performance-based RSUs presented at the maximum potential shares that could be earned and issued
at vesting (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):
        Certain of our performance-based RSUs did not have an accounting grant date as of December 31, 2018, as there is not a mutual understanding between the
Company and the employee of the performance terms. Generally , these performance terms relate to operating income performance for future years where the
performance goals have not yet been set. As of December 31, 2018, there were 3.2 million performance-based RSUs outstanding for which the accounting grant
date has not been set, of which 1.6 million were 2018 grants. Accordingly , no grant date fair value was established and the weighted average grant date fair value
calculated above for 2018 grants excludes these RSUs.
        At December 31, 2018, approximately $98 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to RSUs and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.51 years. Of the total unrecognized compensation cost, $67 million was related to performance-based RSUs, which is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.49 years. The total grant date fair value of vested RSUs was $120 million, $64 million and $123 million for
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively .
        The income tax benefit from stock option exercises and RSU vestings was $94 million, $160 million, and $134 million for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively .

        The Company's tax rate is af fected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, some of which have a statutory tax rate less than the
U.S. rate of 21% , and the relative amount of income earned in each jurisdiction.
        On June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing
arrangements for tax periods starting in 2009 (the "Closing Agreement"). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the
second quarter of 2018 and consisted of a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized
$185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary
adjustments. The Closing Agreement resulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which federal tax payments of
$334 million were made in October 2018.
        On December 22, 2017, the U.S. T ax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. T ax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate
from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018, and implemented the T ransition T ax.
        On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") staf f issued Staf f Accounting Bulletin No. 1 18 ("SAB 1 18"), which provides
guidance on how to account for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 1 18 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the
effects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year , until accounting is
complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts of $636 million for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act in accordance with
SAB 1 18. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we no longer considered the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by
our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.
        In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis of the ef fect of the U.S. T ax Reform Act. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an
additional tax benefit of $285 million for the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act. This is primarily related to the election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect
to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to global intangible low-taxed income ("GIL TI") and the adjustment for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax
assets and liabilities as a result of the U.S. corporate income tax rate reduction. The aggregate U.S. T ax Reform Act impact for 2017 and 2018 is a net tax expense
of $351 million, which consists of a $570 million tax expense related to the T ransition T ax partially of fset by a net benefit of $219 million, mainly related to the
adoption of GIL TI deferred tax accounting and remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
        In 2013, in connection with the October 1 1, 2013 repurchase of approximately 429 million shares of our common stock from V ivendi ("Purchase
Transaction"), we assumed certain tax attributes, generally consisting of net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately $760 million, which
represent a potential tax benefit of approximately $266 million. The Company also obtained indemnification from V ivendi against losses attributable to the
disallowance of claimed utilization of such NOL carryforwards of up to $200 million in unrealized tax benefits in the aggregate, limited to taxable years ending
on or prior to December 31, 2016. No benefit for these tax attributes or indemnification was recorded upon the close of the Purchase T ransaction. As of
December 31, 2017, we had utilized approximately $760 million of the original NOL and had recorded an indemnification asset

of $200 million in "Other assets." Correspondingly , the same amount was recorded as a reduction to the consideration paid for the shares repurchased in "T reasury
stock."
        Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax ef fects of temporary dif ferences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows (amounts in millions):
        As of December 31, 2018, we had gross tax credit carryforwards of $172 million for state purposes. The tax credit carryforwards are presented in "Deferred
tax assets" net of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of uncertain tax positions. In addition, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of
$22 million at December 31, 2018, attributed mainly to losses in France which can be carried forward indefinitely .
        We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than
not" to be realized in the future. T o make that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence
available. As of December 31, 2017, we had a deferred tax asset for California research and development credit carryforwards ("CA R&D Credits"), which can be
carried forward indefinitely . The Closing Agreement impacts historical and prospective filings in certain states, including California, and after considering the
impact of the Closing Agreement on its prospective California taxable income, we determined that our remaining CA R&D Credits no longer met the threshold of
more likely than not to be realized in the future. As such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $61 million. W e will
reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance.

        As of December 31, 2017, we no longer consider the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign
subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded net deferred tax liability related to undistributed foreign earnings of $16 million.
In addition, we have elected to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to GIL TI and recorded a $263 million
deferred tax asset.
        Activision Blizzard's 2009 through 2017 tax years remain open to examination by certain major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. During
February 2018, we were notified by the IRS that our tax returns for our 2012 through 2016 tax years will be subject to examination. In September 2018, the IRS
concluded its examination of our 2009 through 201 1 tax years. W e also have several state and non-U.S. audits pending, including the French and Swedish audits
discussed below . In addition, as part of purchase price accounting for our 2016 acquisition of King, we assumed $74 million of uncertain tax positions primarily
related to pre-acquisition transfer pricing matters. W e are currently in negotiations with the tax authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, which include the UK and
Sweden, with respect to King's transfer pricing for both pre- and post-acquisition tax years. While the outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain, they could
result in an agreement that changes the allocation of profits and losses between these and other relevant jurisdictions or a failure to reach an agreement that results
in unilateral adjustments to the amount and timing of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which King operates.
        In December 2018, we received a decision from the Swedish T ax Agency ("ST A") informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for
the 2016 tax year . The ST A decision described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion (approximately $400 million),
primarily concerning an alleged intercompany asset transfer . We disagree with the ST A's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. W e plan to pursue all
remedies available to us to successfully resolve the matter , including administrative remedies with the ST A, multilateral procedures with other relevant taxing
jurisdictions, and, if necessary , judicial remedies. Further , we may be required to pay the full assessment to the ST A in advance of the final resolution of the
matter . While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to
significant additional tax liabilities.
        In December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the French T ax Authority ("FT A") related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions
involving one of our French subsidiaries for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately
€571 million (approximately $652 million). W e disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. W e plan to pursue all remedies
available to us to successfully resolve this matter , including administrative remedies with the FT A and, if necessary , judicial remedies. While we believe our tax
provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
In addition to the risk of additional tax for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined and/or if the FT A were to
seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
        In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation, or may be subject to examination or investigation, by tax authorities in various
jurisdictions. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such proceedings may
have a material adverse ef fect on the Company's consolidated financial position,

liquidity , or results of operations in the earlier of the period or periods in which the matters are resolved and in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into
account in our financial statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and
consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial remedies.
        As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $917 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $812 million of which would af fect our ef fective tax rate,
if recognized. A reconciliation of total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (amounts in millions):
        As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had approximately $87 million, $121 million, and $71 million, respectively , of accrued interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded $1 1 million, $28 million, and $17 million, respectively ,
of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions.
        The final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the
probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company's management, the ultimate
resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse ef fect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations,
except as noted above.

19. Computation of Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Common Shar e
        The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in millions, except per share data):
        In 2016, certain of our unvested restricted stock units met the definition of participating securities, as they participated in earnings based on their rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents. Therefore, we were required to use the two-class method in our computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, on a weighted-average basis, we had outstanding unvested restricted stock units of 3 million shares of common stock that
participated in earnings.
        The vesting of certain of our employee-related restricted stock units and options is contingent upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance measures.
The shares underlying these equity awards are included in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end
of the reporting period. Approximately 4 million, 7 million, and 8 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the
years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively , as their underlying performance measures had not yet been met.
        Potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would
be anti-dilutive. Therefore, 3 million, 1 million, and 5 million options to purchase shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings
per common share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively , as the ef fect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Commitments and Obligations
        In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our of fices, for
the development of products and for the rights to intellectual property . Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor , developer or
intellectual property holder , as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the
achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones. Further , these payments to third-party developers and intellectual property
holders typically are deemed to be advances and, as such, are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on
sales of the related game. Additionally , in connection with certain intellectual property rights, acquisitions and development agreements, we commit to spend
specified amounts for marketing support for the game(s) which is (are) to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized. Assuming all
contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2018, are scheduled

Legal Proceedings
        In December 2018, we received a decision from the ST A informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for the 2016 tax year . The
STA decision described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion (approximately $400 million) primarily concerning an
alleged intercompany asset transfer . We disagree with the ST A's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. W e plan to pursue all remedies available to us to
successfully resolve the matter , including administrative remedies with the ST A, multilateral procedures with other relevant taxing jurisdictions, and, if necessary ,
judicial remedies. Further , we may be required to pay the full assessment to the ST A in advance of the final resolution of the matter . While we believe our tax
provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
        In December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the FT A related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions involving one of our
French subsidiaries for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately €571 million (approximately
$652 million). W e disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. W e plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully
resolve this matter , including administrative remedies with the FT A and, if necessary , judicial remedies. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31,

additional tax for the 201 1 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined and/or if the FT A were to seek adjustments of a
similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
        In addition, we are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including with
respect to intellectual property , competition and antitrust matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, privacy matters, labor and employment matters, compliance
matters, unclaimed property matters, liability and personal injury claims, product damage claims, collection matters, and/or commercial claims. In the opinion of
management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity .
F-612018, we completed our analysis of the ef fects of the U.S. T ax Reform Act and adjusted the net T ransition T ax liability with consideration
of tax attributes utilization to be $198 million. The Transition T ax liability is payable over and up to an eight-year period and is not
reflected in our Contractual Obligations table above.
(2) Long-term debt obligations represent our obligations related to the contractual principal repayments and interest payments under the
Notes, which are subject to fixed interest rates, as of December 31, 2018. There was no outstanding balance under our New Revolver as

applicable at December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on our debt obligations.

23. Acquisitions
King Digital Entertainment
        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, purchasing all of King's outstanding shares. As a result, King became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Activision Blizzard. King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily on mobile platforms, such as
Android and iOS, and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's results of operations since the King Closing Date are
included in our consolidated financial statements.
        We made this acquisition because we believed that the addition of King's highly-complementary mobile business positioned the Company as a global leader
in interactive entertainment across the console, PC, and mobile platforms, and aligned us for future growth.
        The aggregate purchase price of the King Acquisition was approximately $5.8 billion, which was paid on the King Closing Date and funded primarily with
$3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company . We identified and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
their estimated fair values at the King Closing Date, and allocated the remaining value of approximately $2.7 billion to goodwill.

        The final purchase price allocation was as follows (in millions):
        During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $38 million of expenses related to the King Acquisition, which are included within
"General and administrative" in the consolidated statements of operations.
Share-Based Compensation
        In connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding King options and other equity awards that were unvested as of the King Closing Date
were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock, using an equity award exchange ratio calculated in
accordance with the transaction agreement. As a result, replacement options and other equity awards of 10 million and 3 million, respectively , were issued. The
portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services of $76 million was included in the purchase price.
        The remaining portion of outstanding unvested awards that were assumed were replaced with deferred cash awards. The cash proceeds were placed in an
escrow-like account with the cash releases to occur based on the awards' original vesting schedule upon future service being rendered. The portion of the fair
value related to pre-combination services of $22 million was included in the purchase price.

other revenues—Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses," and "General and administrative," respectively . The intangible assets will be
amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits received.
        The $2.7 billion of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from accelerated expansion as an interactive
entertainment provider in the mobile sector , future franchises, and technology , as well as the management team's proven ability to create future games and
franchises. Approximately $464 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes in the U.S.
King Net Revenue and Earnings
        The amount of net revenue and earnings attributable to King in the Company's consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31,
2016, the period of the King Acquisition, are included in the table below . The amounts presented represent the net revenues and earnings after adjustments for
purchase price accounting, inclusive of amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and deferrals of revenues and related cost of revenues.
Pro Forma Financial Information
        The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and King, on a pro forma basis, as
though the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015. The 2016 pro forma financial information presented includes the ef fects of adjustments related to
amortization char ges from acquired intangible assets, employee compensation from replacement equity awards issued in the King Acquisition and the profit
sharing bonus plan established as part of the King Acquisition, and interest expense from the new debt issued in connection with the King Acquisition, among

• reduce certain non-development and administrative-related costs across our business; and 
• integrate our global and regional sales and "go-to-market," partnerships, and sponsorships capabilities across the business, which we believe will
enable us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater expertise and scale on behalf of our business units.
        We expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring char ges of approximately $150 million in 2019, related to severance, including, in many cases, above
legally required amounts (approximately 65% of the aggregate char ge), facilities costs (approximately 20% of the aggregate char ge), and asset write-downs and
other costs (approximately 15% of the aggregate char ge). W e expect the majority of these char ges to be incurred in the first quarter of 2019, with most of the
balance expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2019. The total pre-tax char ge associated with the restructuring will be paid almost entirely in cash and the
outlays are expected to be incurred throughout 2019.

4.                                      Tax Withholding.
 
(a)                                 Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any Withholding Taxes related to Grantee’s
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Grantee, Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Withholding Taxes is and remains Grantee’s
responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  Grantee further acknowledges that the Company
and/or the Employer (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Withholding Taxes in connection with any aspect of the
Restricted Share Units, including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or payment of the Award, the subsequent sale of Vested Shares acquired, and the
receipt of any dividends; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Share Units
to reduce or eliminate Grantee’s liability for Withholding Taxes or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if Grantee is subject to tax in more than one
jurisdiction, Grantee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for
Withholding Taxes in more than one jurisdiction.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver any Vested Shares unless and until all Withholding Taxes
contemplated by this Section 4 have been satisfied.
 
(b)                                 The Company shall determine the method or methods Grantee may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the vesting
of any Restricted Share Units, the issuance or transfer of any Vested Shares or otherwise in connection with the Award at the time such Withholding Taxes
become due, which may include any of the following: (i) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds; (ii) through the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, that the Company withhold Vested Shares
otherwise then deliverable having a value equal to the aggregate amount of the Withholding Taxes (valued in the same manner used in computing the amount
of such Withholding Taxes); (iii) arranging for the sale, on Grantee’s behalf, of Vested
 
A-3
 
Shares otherwise then deliverable to Grantee (valued in the same manner used in computing the amount of such Withholding Taxes); or (iv) by any
combination of (i), (ii) or (iii) above.  Further, any entity in the Company Group shall have the right to require Grantee to satisfy any Withholding Taxes
contemplated by this Section 4 by any of the aforementioned methods or by withholding from Grantee’s wages or other cash compensation.
 
(c)                                  The Company Group may withhold or account for Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 4 by reference to applicable
withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable statutory rates in Grantee’s jurisdiction(s) of employment and/or residency, and if the
Company Group withholds more than the amount necessary to satisfy the liability, Grantee may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and
will have no entitlement to the equivalent Shares.  If the obligation for Withholding Taxes is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Grantee will
be deemed to have been issued the full number of Vested Shares underlying the Restricted Share Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held
back solely for the purpose of paying the Withholding Taxes.  No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted
Share Units and the Withholding Taxes thereunder.
 
5.                                      Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, Grantee is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
6.                                      Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon vesting of the Restricted Share Units such
number of Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon vesting thereof.
 
7.                                      Dividend Equivalents.  The holder of the Restricted Share Units shall not be entitled to receive any payment, payment-in-kind or any
equivalent with regard to any cash or other dividends that are declared and paid on Common Shares.
 
8.                                      Receipt and Delivery.  As soon as administratively practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) after any Restricted Share Units vest, the
Company shall (a) effect the issuance or transfer of the resulting Vested Shares, (b) cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to be evidenced on
the books and records of the Company, and (c) cause such Vested Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of the person
entitled to such Vested Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided, however, that,
in the event such Vested Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 15 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate evidencing such Vested
Shares and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
9.                                      Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be
 
A-4
 
made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may amend
the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the rights of Grantee taken as a
whole without Grantee’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award (i) in
recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 10 hereof) affecting any entity in the Company
Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in
response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to prevent the Award from becoming subject to
any adverse consequences under Section 409A.
 
10.                               Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Grantee that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
11.                               Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or transfer
any Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares, and no Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or
otherwise disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no
obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect
such compliance.  Grantee shall make such representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then
existence or non-existence of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares, to issue or
transfer Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares in compliance with the provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state
securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to register the issuance or transfer of Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares or
resale of Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities law.
 
12.                               Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, and only with the Company’s consent, Grantee may transfer Restricted Share Units for
estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order (or a comparable order under applicable local law); provided, however, that any transferee
shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, the
 
A-5
 
Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in connection with such transfer; and
provided, further that Grantee will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.  Except as otherwise
permitted under the Plan or this Section 12, the Restricted Share Units shall not be transferable by Grantee other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution.
 
13.                               Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)                                 Grantee is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state, and local tax, social insurance, national insurance contributions,
payroll tax, payment on account or other tax liabilities applicable to Grantee in connection with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)                                 The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by Grantee in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
(c)                                  [If and when Grantee is an “executive officer” of the Company within the meaning of the Executive Stock Ownership
Guidelines, the Award will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines and the limitations contained therein
on the ability of Grantee to transfer any Vested Shares.]
 
14.                               Section 409A.
 
(a)                                 Payments contemplated with respect to the Award are intended to comply with Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject
to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (ii) if any provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith
judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the imposition on Grantee or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of Grantee, in the manner
that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties;
provided, however, that this Section 14 does not create an obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no
event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by Grantee pursuant to
Section 409A.
 
(b)                                 Neither Grantee nor any of Grantee’s creditors or beneficiaries shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within
the meaning of Section 409A) payable with respect to the Award to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment
or garnishment.  Except as permitted under Section 409A, any deferred
 
A-6
 
compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) payable to Grantee or for Grantee’s benefit with respect to the Award may not be reduced by, or offset
against, any amount owing by Grantee to the Company.
 
(c)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if (i) the Committee determines in good faith that the Restricted Share
Units do not qualify for the “short-term deferral exception” under Section 409A, (ii) Grantee is a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A) and
(iii) a delay in the issuance or transfer of Vested Shares to Grantee or his or her estate or beneficiaries hereunder by reason of Grantee’s “separation from
service” (as defined in Section 409A) with any entity in the Company Group is required to avoid tax penalties under Section 409A but is not already provided
for by this Award, the Company shall cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to Grantee or Grantee’s estate or beneficiary upon the earlier of
(A) the date that is the first business day following the date that is six months after the date of Grantee’s separation from service and (B) Grantee’s death.
 
15.                               Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Vested
Shares to bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’), OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
16.                               No Right to Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall create a right to employment with the
Employer or any other entity in the Company Group and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to retire, request the resignation of or terminate
Grantee’s employment or service relationship at any time.
 
17.                               No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of Restricted Share Units shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any
right of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable
against the Company except to the extent set forth in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
18.                               Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
19.                               Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)                                 For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Restricted Share Units or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of
 
A-7
 
California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the U.S. for the
Central District of California and no other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Restricted Share Units is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)                                 To the extent that U.S. federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
20.                               Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and Grantee and, to the extent applicable, Grantee’s permitted assigns under Section 12 hereof and Grantee’s estate or
beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
21.                               Delivery of Notices and Other Documents.
 
(a)                                 Any notice or other document which Grantee may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, U.S.A. Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other address

(b)                                 Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to Grantee pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to Grantee at the address shown on any employment agreement, service contract or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in
effect at the time, or such other address as Grantee by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole
discretion, deliver any such document to Grantee electronically via an e-mail to Grantee at his or her Company-provided email address or through a notice
delivered to such e-mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party
designated by the Company, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
22.                               Conflict with Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and the terms of the Plan, the
terms of the Plan shall control.
 
23.                               Appendix.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Restricted Share Units shall be subject to any special terms and
conditions set forth in the Appendix for Grantee’s country of work and/or residence, both of which constitute a part of these Award Terms.  Moreover, if
Grantee relocates his or her work and/or residence to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will
 
A-8
 
apply to Grantee, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with
applicable local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.
 
24.                               Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Grantee’s participation in the Plan, on
the Restricted Share Units and on any Common Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to
comply with applicable local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require Grantee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that
may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
25.                               Waiver.  Grantee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by Grantee or any other grantee of an equity award from the
Company.

APPENDIX
 
TO
 
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.
2014 INCENTIVE PLAN
 
PERFORMANCE-VESTING RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT AWARD TERMS
 
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS BY COUNTRY
 
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan or the Award Terms, as the case may be.
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
This Appendix includes special terms and conditions applicable to Grantees who work and/or reside in the countries covered by the Appendix.  These terms
and conditions are in addition to or, if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the Award Terms.
 
If Grantee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfers employment
and/or residency after the Restricted Share Units were granted or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes (i.e., Grantee is a “mobile
employee”), the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the special terms and conditions shall apply to Grantee.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
This Appendix also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which Grantee should be aware with respect to his or her
participation in the Plan.  The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix refers
as of October 2018.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  As a result, the Company strongly recommends that Grantee not rely on the
notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at
the time Grantee vests in the Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares acquired under the Plan are sold.
 
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to the particular situation of Grantee, and the Company is not in a position to assure
Grantee of any particular result.  Accordingly, Grantee should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may
apply to his or her situation.  Finally, if Grantee is a mobile employee, the information contained herein may not be applicable to Grantee in the same manner.
 
B-1
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL GRANTEES WHO WORK AND/OR RESIDE OUTSIDE THE U.S.
 
Nature of Grant.  By accepting the Award, Grantee acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:
 
(1)               the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the
Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and/or these Award Terms;
 
(2)               the grant of the Restricted Share Units is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future
grants of rights to receive Common Shares, or benefits in lieu of rights to receive Common Shares, even if rights to receive Common Shares have been
granted in the past;
 
(3)               all decisions with respect to future grants of rights to receive Common Shares, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
 
(4)               Grantee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;
 
(5)               the grant of the Restricted Share Units and any Common Shares underlying the Restricted Share Units, and the income in respect of and the value of
the same, are extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and are
outside the scope of the employment agreement or service contract between Grantee and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company
Group, if any;

DATA PRIVACY INFORMATION AND CONSENT
 
The following provision applies to Grantees who work and/or reside outside the European Union/European Economic Area.
 
Data Collection and Usage.  Grantee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of
Grantee’s personal data as described in the Grant Notice and these Award Terms by and among, as applicable, the Employer or any other entity in the
Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Grantee’s participation in the Plan.
 
Data Processing.  Grantee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about Grantee, including, without
limitation, Grantee’s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance, passport or other identification number, salary,
nationality, job title, any directorships held in any entity in the Company Group, any Common Shares owned, details of all Restricted Share Units or any other
entitlement to the Common Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Grantee’s favor (the
“Data”), for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
 
Stock Plan Administration, Data Transfer, Retention and Data Subject Rights.  Grantee understands that the Data will be transferred to the Equity
Account Administrator, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  Grantee understands that the
recipients of the Data may be located in Grantee’s country of work and/or residence, or elsewhere, and that any recipient’s country may have different data
privacy laws and protections than Grantee’s country of work and/or residence.  Grantee understands that Grantee may request a list with the names and
addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting Grantee’s local human resources representative.  Grantee authorizes the Company, the Equity
Account Administrator and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and
managing the Plan to
 
B-4
 
receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing Grantee’s
participation in the Plan.  Grantee understands that the Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Grantee’s
participation in the Plan.  Grantee understands that Grantee may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of
the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing
Grantee’s local human resources representative.  Further, Grantee understands that he or she is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If
Grantee does not consent, or if Grantee later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her employment status or service with the Employer will not be
affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing Grantee’s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Restricted Share Units or other
equity awards to Grantee or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, Grantee understands that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect Grantee’s
ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of Grantee’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Grantee understands
that Grantee may contact Grantee’s local human resources representative.
 
The following provision applies to Grantees who work and/or reside in the European Union/European Economic Area.
 
Data Collection and Usage.  Pursuant to applicable data protection laws, Grantee is hereby notified that the Company collects, processes, uses and transfers
certain personally-identifiable information about Grantee for the exclusive legitimate purpose of granting Restricted Share Units and implementing,
administering and managing Grantee’s participation in the Plan.  Specifics of the data processing are described below.
 
Controller.  The Company is the controller responsible for the processing of Grantee’s personal data in connection with the Plan.
 
Personal Data Subject to Processing.  The Company collects, processes and uses the following types of personal data about Grantee: name, home address
and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of
stock or directorships held in any entity in the Company Group, details of all Restricted Share Units or any other entitlement to Common Shares awarded,
canceled, settled, vested, unvested or outstanding in Grantee’s favor, which the Company receives from Grantee or the Employer (“Personal Data”).
 
Purposes and Legal Bases of Processing.  The Company processes the Personal Data for the purpose of performing its contractual obligations under the
Award Terms, granting Restricted Share Units, implementing, administering and managing Grantee’s participation in the Plan and facilitating compliance
with applicable tax and securities law.  The legal basis for the processing of the Personal Data by the Company and the third-party service providers described
below is the necessity of the data processing for the Company to perform its contractual obligations under the Award Terms and for the Company’s legitimate
business interests of managing the Plan and generally administering employee equity awards.
 
B-5
 
Stock Plan Administration Service Providers.  The Company transfers Personal Data to the Equity Account Administrator, an independent stock plan
administrator with operations, relevant to the Company, in the United States, which assists the Company with the implementation, administration and
management of the Plan.  In the future, the Company may select a different service provider and may share Personal Data with such service providers. 
Grantee will be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider, which is a condition of Grantee’s ability to
participate in the Plan.  Grantee’s Personal Data will only be accessible by those individuals requiring access to it for purposes of implementing,
administering and operating Grantee’s participation in the Plan.  Grantee understands that Grantee may request a list with the names and addresses of any
potential recipients of Personal Data by contacting Grantee’s local human resources representative.
 
International Data Transfers.  The Company and its service providers, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator, operate, relevant to
the Company, in the United States, which means that it will be necessary for Personal Data to be transferred to, and processed in, the United States.  Grantee
understands and acknowledges that the United States is not subject to an unlimited adequacy finding by the European Commission and that Grantee’s
Personal Data may not have an equivalent level of protection as compared to Grantee’s country of work and/or residence.  To provide appropriate safeguards
for the protection of Grantee’s Personal Data, the Personal Data is transferred to the Company based on data transfer and processing agreements
implementing the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.  Grantee may request a copy of the safeguards used to protect his or her Personal Data by contacting the
Company at: employeeprivacy@activision.com.
 
Data Retention.  The Company will use the Personal Data only as long as necessary to implement, administer and manage Grantee’s participation in the
Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including tax and securities laws.  When the Company no longer needs the Personal Data,
the Company will remove it from its systems.  If the Company keeps data longer, it would be to satisfy legal or regulatory obligations and the Company’s
legal basis would be relevant laws or regulations.
 
Data Subject Rights.  To the extent provided by law, Grantee has the right to (i) inquire whether and what kind of Personal Data the Company holds about
Grantee and how it is processed, and to access or request copies of such Personal Data, (ii) request the correction or supplementation of Personal Data that is
inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date in light of the purposes underlying the processing, (iii) obtain the erasure of Personal Data no longer necessary for the
purposes underlying the processing or processed in non-compliance with applicable legal requirements, (iv) request the Company to restrict the processing of
Personal Data in certain situations where Grantee feels its processing is inappropriate, (v) object, in certain circumstances, to the processing of Personal Data
for legitimate interests, (vi) request portability of Personal Data that Grantee has actively or passively provided to the Company, where the processing of such
Personal Data is based on consent or a contractual agreement with Grantee and is carried out by automated means, or (vii) lodge a complaint with the
competent local data protection authority.  To receive additional information regarding Grantee’s rights, raise any other questions regarding the practices
described in the Award Terms or to exercise his or her rights, Grantee should contact the Company at: employeeprivacy@activision.com.
 
B-6
 
Contractual Requirement.  Grantee’s provision of Personal Data and its processing as described above is a contractual requirement and a condition to
Grantee’s ability to participate in the Plan.  Grantee understands that, as a consequence of Grantee’s refusing to provide Personal Data, the Company may not
be able to allow Grantee to participate in the Plan, grant Restricted Share Units to Grantee or administer or maintain such Restricted Share Units.  However,
Grantee’s participation in the Plan and his or her acceptance of the Award Terms are purely voluntary.  While Grantee will not receive Restricted Share Units
if he or she decides against participating in the Plan or providing Personal Data as described above, Grantee’s career and salary will not be affected in any
way.  For more information on the consequences of the refusal to provide Personal Data, Grantee may contact the Company at:
employeeprivacy@activision.com.

Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.   Grantee is required to report investments held abroad or foreign financial assets (e.g., cash, Restricted
Share Units, Common Shares) that may generate income taxable in Italy on an annual tax return (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special form if no tax
return is due, irrespective of their value.  The same reporting duties apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments abroad or
foreign financial assets (e.g., cash, Restricted Share Units and Common Shares), are beneficial owners of the investment pursuant to Italian money laundering
provisions.  Grantee should consult his or her personal tax advisor for details regarding this requirement.
 
Foreign Financial Assets Tax Notification.  The fair market value of any Common Shares held outside of Italy is subject to an annual foreign assets tax. 
The fair market value for this purpose is the value of the Common Shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. on December 31 of the year or, for shares
disposed of during the course of the year, on the last day Grantee held the Common Shares (in such case, or when the Common Shares are acquired during the
course of the year, the tax is levied in proportion to the actual days of holding over the calendar year).  Grantee should consult with his or her personal tax
advisor about the foreign financial assets tax.

Acknowledgement of the Award Terms.  By accepting the Restricted Share Units, Grantee acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Plan and
the Award Terms, including this Appendix, which he or she has reviewed.  Grantee further acknowledges that he or she accepts all the provisions of the Plan
and the Award Terms, including this Appendix.  Grantee also acknowledges that he or she has read and specifically and expressly approves the terms and
conditions set forth in “Nature of Grant” Section of the Appendix, which clearly provide as follows:
 
(1)                                 Grantee’s participation in the Plan does not constitute an acquired right;
 
(2)                                 The Plan and Grantee’s participation in it are offered by the Company on a wholly discretionary basis;
 
(3)                                 Grantee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary; and

Labor Law Acknowledgement and Policy Statement.  By accepting the Restricted Share Units, Grantee acknowledges that the Company with registered
offices at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, U.S.A., is solely responsible for the administration of the Plan.  Grantee further
acknowledges that his or her participation in the Plan, the grant of Restricted Share Units and any acquisition of Common Shares under the Plan do not
constitute an employment relationship between Grantee and the Company because Grantee is participating in the Plan on a wholly commercial basis and his
or her sole employer is Actibliz Mexico S. de RL de CV, Tihuatlan 41,602, San Jerónimo Aculco, Federal District, México (“Activision-Mexico”).  Based on
the foregoing, Grantee expressly acknowledges that the Plan and the benefits that he or she may derive from participation in the Plan do not establish any
rights between Grantee and his or her employer, Activision-Mexico, and do not form part of the employment conditions and/or benefits provided by
Activision-Mexico, and any modification of the Plan or its termination shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of Grantee’s
employment.
 
Grantee further understands that his or her participation in the Plan is the result of a unilateral and discretionary decision of the Company and, therefore, the
Company reserves the absolute right to amend and/or discontinue Grantee’s participation in the Plan at any time, without any liability to Grantee.
 
B-26
 
Finally, Grantee hereby declares that he or she does not reserve to him or herself any action or right to bring any claim against the Company for any
compensation or damages regarding any provision of the Plan or the benefits derived under the Plan, and that he or she therefore grants a full and broad
release to the Company, its Subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, representation offices, shareholders, officers, agents or legal representatives, with respect to any
claim that may arise.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Nature of Grant. This provision supplements the “Nature of Grant” Section of the Appendix:
 
In accepting the Restricted Share Units, Grantee consents to participate in the Plan and acknowledges having received and read a copy of the Plan.
 
Grantee understands that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant Restricted Share Units under the Plan to individuals
who may be employees of the Company or any other entity in the Company Group throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered
into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not bind the Company or any other entity in the Company Group.  Consequently, Grantee
understands that the Restricted Share Units are granted on the assumption and condition that such Restricted Share Units and any Common Shares acquired
under the Plan shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any other entity in the Company Group) and shall not be
considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, Grantee understands
that the Restricted Share Units would not granted but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, Grantee acknowledges and freely accepts
that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any grant of the Restricted Share Units
shall be null and void.
 
Further, the vesting of the Restricted Share Units is expressly conditioned on Grantee’s active employment, such that if Grantee’s employment or service
terminates for any reason whatsoever, the Restricted Share Units cease vesting immediately effective on the date of termination of employment.  This will be
the case, for example, even if Grantee (1) is considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); (2) is
dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) terminates service due to a change of work location, duties or any other
employment or contractual condition; (4) terminates service due to the Company’s or any entity in the Company Group’s unilateral breach of contract; or
(5) is terminated from employment for any other reason whatsoever.  Consequently, upon Grantee’s termination of employment for any of the above reasons,
Grantee may automatically lose any rights to Restricted Share Units that were unvested on the date of termination.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
Exchange Control Notification.  The acquisition, ownership and sale of Common Shares under the Plan must be declared for statistical purposes to the
Spanish Dirección General de Comercio e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department of the Ministry of
Economy and Competitiveness.  Generally, the declaration must be made each
 
B-34
 
January for Common Shares owned as of December 31 of the prior year, by means of a D-6 form; however, if the value of the Common Shares acquired or
sold exceeds €1,502,530 (or if Grantee holds 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle Grantee to join the
Company’s board of directors), the declaration must be filed also within one month of the acquisition or sale, as applicable.
 
Grantee is required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), foreign instruments
(including any Common Shares acquired under the Plan) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Common Shares made
to Grantee by the Company), depending on the amount of the transactions during the relevant year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
relevant year. Generally, the report is required on an annual basis (by January 20 of each year).  Grantee should consult with his or her personal advisor to
ensure that Grantee is properly complying with his or her reporting obligations.
 
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  If Grantee holds rights or assets (e.g., Common Shares or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside
of Spain with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of right or asset (e.g., Common Shares, cash, etc.) as of December 31 each year, Grantee is required to
report certain information regarding such rights and assets on tax form 720.  After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will
only apply for subsequent years if the value of any previously-reported rights or assets increases by more than €20,000.  If reporting is required, the reporting
must be completed by the following March 31.  Grantee should consult his or her personal tax advisor for details regarding this requirement.
 
Securities Law Notification.  The Restricted Share Units described in this document do not qualify as securities under Spanish regulations.  No “offer of
securities to the public,” within the meaning of Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory.  The Plan, the Award Terms (including
this Appendix), and any other documents evidencing the award of Restricted Share Units have not been, nor will they be, registered with the Comisión
Nacional del Mercado de Valores (Spanish Securities Exchange Commission), and none of those documents constitutes a public offering prospectus.

(a)                                 For U.S. Grantees only, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
 
“Employment Violation” means any material breach by Grantee of his or her employment agreement with any entity in the Company
Group for so long as the terms of such employment agreement shall apply to Grantee (with any breach of the post-termination obligations contained therein
deemed to be material for purposes of this definition).
 
“Look-back Period” means, with respect to any Employment Violation by Grantee, the period beginning on the date which is 12 months
prior to the date of such Employment Violation by Grantee and ending on the date of computation of the Recapture Amount with respect to such Employment
Violation.
 
“Recapture Amount” means, with respect to any Employment Violation by Grantee, the gross gain realized or unrealized by Grantee upon
all vesting of Restricted Share Units or delivery or transfer of Vested Shares during the Look-back Period with respect to such Employment Violation, which
gain shall be calculated as the sum of:
 
(i)                                     if Grantee has received Vested Shares during such Look-back Period and sold any such Vested Shares, an amount equal to the sum
of the sales price for all such Vested Shares; plus
 
(ii)                                  if Grantee has received Vested Shares during such Look-back Period and not sold all such Vested Shares, an amount equal to the
product of (A) the greatest of the following: (1) the Market Value per Share of Common Shares on the date such Vested Shares were issued or
transferred to Grantee, (2) the arithmetic average of the per share closing sales prices of Common Shares as reported on Nasdaq for the 30 trading
day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Company’s written notice of its exercise of its rights under Section 3
hereof, or (3) the arithmetic average of the per share closing sales prices of Common Shares as reported on Nasdaq for the 30 trading day period
ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of computation, times (B) the number of such Vested Shares which were not sold.
 
2.                                      Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement, service
contract or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant
 
B-40
 
Notice or these Award Terms, the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the
terms of any employment agreement, service contract or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms
of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.
 
3.                                      Employment Violation.  The terms of this Section 3 shall apply to the Restricted Share Units if Grantee is or becomes subject to an
employment agreement with any entity in the Company Group.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the
forfeiture by Grantee to the Company of any outstanding Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares which have yet to settle pursuant to Section 8 of Exhibit A
and (b) payment by Grantee to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of
payment by Grantee to the Company of the Recapture Amount, Grantee, in his or her discretion, may tender to the Company the Vested Shares acquired
during the Look-back Period with respect to such Employment Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such
forfeiture of Restricted Share Units and payment of the Recapture Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or
remedy available to the Company arising out of or in connection with such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate
Grantee’s employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive relief and additional monetary damages.

A-3
 
the issuance or transfer of Shares to the person entitled thereto has been evidenced on the books and records of the Company pursuant to clause (ii) of
Section 3(g) hereof following exercise of the Stock Option.
 
(g)                                  Issuance and Delivery of Shares.  As soon as practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) after the valid exercise of the Stock
Option, the Company shall (i) effect the issuance or transfer of the Shares purchased upon such exercise, (ii) cause the issuance or transfer of such Shares to
be evidenced on the books and records of the Company, and (iii) cause such Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of
the person entitled to such Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided, however,
that, in the event such Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 14 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate evidencing such Shares
and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
(h)                                 Partial Exercise.  If the Stock Option shall have been exercised with respect to less than all of the Shares purchasable upon
exercise of the Stock Option, the Company shall make a notation in its books and records to reflect the partial exercise of the Stock Option and the number of
Shares that thereafter remain available for purchase upon exercise of the Stock Option.
 
4.                                      Termination of Employment.
 
(a)                                 Cause.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that (a) the Holder’s employment is terminated by any entity in
the Company Group for Cause or (b) if the Holder terminates his or her employment with the Company Group in breach of an employment agreement with
any entity in the Company Group, as of the date of such termination of employment the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest, if not then fully vested, (ii) no
longer be exercisable, whether or not vested, and (iii) be immediately cancelled.
 
(b)                                 Death or Disability. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder dies while employed by any entity in
the Company Group or the Holder’s employment with any entity in the Company Group is terminated due to the Holder’s Disability, the Stock Option shall
(i) cease to vest as of the date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability (as determined by the Committee), as the case may be, and
(ii) to the extent vested as of the date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability, as the case may be, remain exercisable in accordance
with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the date of the Holder’s death or termination of employment, as the case may be, and
(B) the Expiration Date, after which the Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable and shall be immediately cancelled.  To the extent not vested as of the
date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability, as the case may be, the Stock Option shall be immediately cancelled and shall no longer
be exercisable.
 
(c)                                  Other.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder’s employment is terminated for any reason not
addressed by Section 4(a) or 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest as of the date of such termination of employment and (ii) to the extent vested
as of the date of such termination of employment, be exercisable in accordance with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) (i) in the case of a termination
by the Holder, the 30th day after the date of such termination of employment or (ii) in the case of a termination by the Company Group, the 90th day after the
date of such termination of
 
A-4
 
employment (or, in either case, if the Holder is prohibited from exercising the Stock Option during some or all of the 30-day or 90-day period, as the case
may be, following such termination date because such exercise would not be in compliance with the Exercise Rules and Regulations, whatever later date may
be determined in accordance with a Committee-approved policy) and (B) the Expiration Date, after which the Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable and
shall be immediately cancelled.  To the extent not vested as of the date of such termination of service, the Stock Option shall be immediately cancelled and
shall no longer be exercisable.
 
5.                                      Tax Withholding.
 
(a)                                 Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any Withholding Taxes related to the Holder’s
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Holder, the Holder acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Withholding Taxes is and remains the
Holder’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Holder further acknowledges that the
Company and/or the Employer (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Withholding Taxes in connection with any aspect
of the Stock Option, including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Stock Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such
exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Stock
Option to reduce or eliminate the Holder’s liability for Withholding Taxes or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Holder is subject to tax in more
than one jurisdiction, the Holder acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or
account for Withholding Taxes in more than one jurisdiction.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option
unless and until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 have been satisfied.
 
(b)                                 The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the
exercise (in whole or in part) of the Stock Option, the issuance or transfer of any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option or otherwise in connection with the
Award at the time such Withholding Taxes become due, which may include any of the following: (i) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified
check or wire transfer of immediately available funds; (ii) if securities of the Company of the same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national
securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through
the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent,
such other brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such
exercise and to thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of such
Withholding Taxes; (iii) through the withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise; or (iv) by any combination of (i), (ii) or (iii) above.  Further,
any entity in the Company Group shall have the right to require the Holder to satisfy any Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 by any of the
aforementioned methods or by withholding from the Holder’s wages or other cash compensation.
 
(c)                                  The Company Group may withhold or account for Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 by reference to applicable
withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable statutory rates in the Holder’s jurisdiction(s) of employment and/or
 
A-5
 
residency,, and if the Company Group withholds more than the amount necessary to satisfy the liability, the Holder may receive a refund of any over-withheld
amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent Shares.  If the obligation for Withholding Taxes is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax
purposes the Holder will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the
purpose of paying the Withholding Taxes.  No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Option and the issuance of
Withholding Taxes thereunder.
 
6.                                      Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, the Holder is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan,
the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
7.                                      Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon exercise of the Stock Option such number of
Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon exercise thereof.
 
8.                                      Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of the Holder taken as a whole without the Holder’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may
amend the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 9 hereof)
affecting any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of
the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to
prevent the Award from becoming subject to Section 409A.
 
9.                                      Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Holder that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
A-6
 
10.                               Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Stock Option may not be exercised, and the Stock
Option and Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Stock Option may not be purchased, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no
obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of the Stock Option or Shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, any state securities commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such
compliance.  The Holder shall make such representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then
existence or non-existence of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, relating to the Stock Option or Shares, to issue or transfer the Stock
Option or Shares in compliance with the provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to register the issuance or resale of the Stock Option or Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal
securities law or applicable state securities law.
 
11.                               Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, and only with the Company’s consent, the Holder may transfer all or part of the Stock
Option for estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order (or a comparable order under applicable local law); provided, however, that any
transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Company in connection with such transfer; and provided further that the Holder will remain bound by the terms and conditions
of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 11, the Stock Option shall not be
transferable by the Holder other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
12.                               Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)                                 The Holder is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state, and local tax, social insurance, national insurance
contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax liabilities applicable to the Holder in connection with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and
Regulations.
 
(b)                                 The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by the Holder in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
(c)                                  [The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines and the limitations
contained therein on the ability of the Holder to transfer any Common Shares.](1)
 
(1)  Include in agreements memorializing awards to executive officers to which the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines apply.
 
A-7
 
13.                               Section 409A.  As the Exercise Price is equal to the fair market value of a Share on the Date of Grant, payments contemplated with respect
to the Award are intended to be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and
interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (b) if any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the
imposition on the Holder or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of
the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of the Holder, in the manner that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith
determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties; provided, however, that this Section 13 does not create an
obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or
gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by the Holder pursuant to Section 409A.
 
14.                               Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Shares to
bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’),
OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
15.                               No Right to Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall create a right to employment with the
Employer or any other entity in the Company Group and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to retire, request the resignation of or terminate
the Holder’s employment or service relationship at any time.
 
16.                               No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of the Stock Option shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any right
of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable against
the Company except to the extent set forth, in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
17.                               Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
18.                               Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)                                 For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Stock Option or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation
shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California, or
 
A-8
 
the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of California and no other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Stock Option is made
and/or to be performed.
 
(b)                                 To the extent that U.S. federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
19.                               Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and the Holder and, to the extent applicable, the Holder’s permitted assigns under Section 3(b) hereof and the Holder’s
estate or beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
20.                               Delivery of Notices and Other Documents.

connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Holder at the address shown on any employment agreement, service contract or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the
Company Group in effect at the time, or such other address as the Holder by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The
Company may also, in its sole discretion, deliver any such document to the Holder electronically via an e-mail to the Holder at his or her Company-provided
email address or through a notice delivered to such e-mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the
Company or a third party designated by the Company, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon
delivery.
 
21.                               Conflict with Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and the terms of the Plan, the
terms of the Plan shall control.

set forth in the Appendix for the Holder’s country of work and/or residence, which constitute a part of these Award Terms.  Moreover, if the Holder relocates
his or her work and/or residence to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to the Holder,
to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with applicable local law
or facilitate the administration of the Plan.

23.                               Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Holder’s participation in the Plan,
on the Stock Option and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with
applicable local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require the Holder to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
24.                               Waiver.  The Holder acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by the Holder or any other holder of an equity award from
the Company.

STOCK OPTION AWARD TERMS
 
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS BY COUNTRY
 
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan or the Award Terms, as the case may be.
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
This Appendix includes special terms and conditions applicable to Holders who work and/or reside in the countries covered by the Appendix.  These terms
and conditions are in addition to or, if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the Award Terms.
 
If the Holder is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfers
employment and/or residency after the Stock Option was granted or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes (i.e., the Holder is a
“mobile employee”), the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the special terms and conditions shall apply to the Holder.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
This Appendix also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which the Holder should be aware with respect to his or her
participation in the Plan.  The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix refers
as of October 2018.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Holder not rely on the
notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at
the time Shares are purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option or Shares purchased under the Plan are sold.
 
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to the particular situation of the Holder, and the Company is not in a position to assure
the Holder of any particular result.  Accordingly, each Holder should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country
may apply to his or her situation.  Finally, if the Holder is a mobile employee, the information contained herein may not be applicable to the Holder in the
same manner.
 
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL HOLDERS WHO WORK AND/OR RESIDE OUTSIDE THE U.S.
 
Nature of Grant.  By accepting the Stock Option, the Holder acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:
 
(1)         the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the
Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and/or these Award Terms;
 
(2)         the grant of the Stock Option is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of
rights to purchase Common Shares, or benefits in lieu of grants of rights to purchase Common Shares, even if grants of rights to purchase Common
Shares have been granted in the past;
 
(3)         all decisions with respect to future grants of rights to purchase Common Shares, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
 
(4)         the Holder’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;
 
(5)         the grant of the Stock Option and any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income in respect of and the value of the same are extraordinary items
that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and which are outside the scope
of the employment agreement or service contract between the Holder and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, if
any;
 
(6)         the Stock Option and any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income in respect of and the value of the same are not intended to replace any
pension rights or compensation;
 
(7)         the Stock Option and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income in respect of and the value of the same, are not part of normal or expected
compensation or salary for any purpose, including, without limitation, the calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy,
dismissal, end of service payment, bonus, long-service award, leave-related payment, holiday pay, pension or retirement or welfare benefit or similar
payments;
 
(8)         the Stock Option grant and the Holder’s participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment or service contract or relationship
with the Company and, furthermore, the Stock Option grant will not be interpreted to form an employment agreement or service contract or
relationship with any other company in the Company Group;
 
(9)               the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
 
B-2
 
(10)        if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, the Stock Option will have no value;
 
(11)        if the Holder exercises the Stock Option and obtains Shares, the value of those Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value,
even below the Exercise Price;
 
(12)        unless otherwise agreed with the Company, the Stock Option and the Shares subject to the Stock Option, and the income and value of same, are not
granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service the Holder may provide as a director of any entity of Company Group;
 
(13)        no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Stock Option resulting from termination of the Holder’s
continuous service with the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction in which the Holder is employed or the terms of the employment agreement or service contract between the
Holder and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company Group, if any);
 
(14)        unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event of the termination of the Holder’s continuous service (regardless of the reason for such
termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction in which the Holder is employed or the
terms of the employment agreement or service contract between the Holder and the Company, the Employer or any other entity in the Company
Group, if any), the Holder’s right to receive or vest in the Stock Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Holder
is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include
a period of “garden leave” or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of the termination of the Holder’s continuous service
(regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction in
which the Holder is employed or the terms of the Holder’s employment agreement or service contract, if any), the Holder’s right to exercise the
Stock Option after termination of the Holder’s continuous service, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of the Holder’s active
employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to
determine when the Holder is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Holder’s Stock Option grant (including whether the Holder may still
be considered actively employed while on a leave of absence);
 
(15)        the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Holder’s
participation in the Plan, or the Holder’s acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares;
 
B-3
 
(16)        the Holder should consult with the Holder’s own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding the Holder’s participation in the Plan before
taking any action related to the Plan;
 
(17)        unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Stock Option and the benefits evidenced by these Award Terms do
not create any entitlement to have the Stock Option or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor be exchanged, cashed
out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and
 
(18)        neither the Company, the Employer nor any other entity in the Company Group shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the
Holder’s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Stock Option or of any amounts due to the Holder pursuant to
the exercise of the Stock Option or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon exercise.
 
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Requirements.  The Holder acknowledges that there may be certain foreign asset and/or account reporting requirements
which may affect the Holder’s ability to acquire or hold Shares acquired under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any
dividends paid on Shares acquired under the Plan) in a brokerage or bank account outside the Holder’s country of work and/or residence.  The Holder may be
required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in his or her country.  The Holder also may be required to repatriate sale
proceeds or other funds received as a result of the Holder’s participation in the Plan to his or her country through a designated bank or broker within a certain
time after receipt.  The Holder acknowledges that it is his or her responsibility to be compliant with such regulations, and the Holder is advised to consult his
or her personal legal advisor for any details.
 
Language.  The Holder acknowledges that he or she is sufficiently proficient in English, or has consulted with an advisor who is sufficiently proficient in
English, to understand the terms and conditions of these Award Terms.  Furthermore, if the Grant Notice, these Award Terms or any other document related to
the Plan has been translated into a language other than English and the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version then, by
accepting the Award, the Holder acknowledges that the English version will control.
 
DATA PRIVACY INFORMATION AND CONSENT
 
The following provision applies to Holders who work and/or reside outside the European Union/European Economic Area.
 
Data Collection and Usage.  The Holder hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the
Holder’s personal data as described in the Grant Notice and these Award Terms by and among, as applicable, the Employer or any other entity in the
Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Holder’s participation in the Plan.
 
B-4
 
Data Processing.  The Holder understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Holder, including, without
limitation, the Holder’s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance, passport or other identification number,
salary, nationality, job title, any directorships held in any entity in the Company Group, any Shares owned, details of all options or any other entitlement to
Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Holder’s favor (the “Data”), for the purpose of
implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
 
Stock Plan Administration, Data Transfer, Retention and Data Subject Rights.  The Holder understands that the Data will be transferred to the Equity
Account Administrator, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  The Holder understands that
the recipients of the Data may be located in the Holder’s country of work and/or residence, or elsewhere, and that any recipient’s country may have different
data privacy laws and protections than the Holder’s country of work and/or residence.  The Holder understands that the Holder may request a list with the
names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Holder’s local human resources representative.  The Holder authorizes the
Company, the Equity Account Administrator and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing,
administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing the Holder’s participation in the Plan.  The Holder understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement,
administer and manage the Holder’s participation in the Plan.  The Holder understands that the Holder may, at any time, view the Data, request additional
information about the storage and processing of the Data, require any necessary amendments to the Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any
case without cost, by contacting in writing the Holder’s local human resources representative.  Further, the Holder understands that he or she is providing the
consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If the Holder does not consent, or if the Holder later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her employment
status or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Holder’s consent is that the Company would not
be able to grant the Holder Stock Options or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, the Holder understands that refusal or
withdrawal of consent may affect the Holder’s ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of the Holder’s refusal to consent
or withdrawal of consent, the Holder understands that the Holder may contact the Holder’s local human resources representative.
 
The following provision applies to Holders who work and/or reside in the European Union/European Economic Area.
 
Data Collection and Usage.  Pursuant to applicable data protection laws, the Holder is hereby notified that the Company collects, processes, uses and
transfers certain personally-identifiable information about the Holder for the exclusive legitimate purpose of granting Stock Options and implementing,
administering and managing the Holder’s participation in the Plan.  Specifics of the data processing are described below.
 
B-5
 
Controller.  The Company is the controller responsible for the processing of the Holder’s personal data in connection with the Plan.
 
Personal Data Subject to Processing.  The Company collects, processes and uses the following types of personal data about the Holder: name, home address
and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of
stock or directorships held in any entity in the Company Group, details of all Stock Options or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, settled,
vested, unvested or outstanding in the Holder’s favor, which the Company receives from the Holder or the Employer (“Personal Data”).
 
Purposes and Legal Bases of Processing.  The Company processes the Personal Data for the purpose of performing its contractual obligations under the
Award Terms, granting Stock Options, implementing, administering and managing the Holder’s participation in the Plan and facilitating compliance with
applicable tax and securities law.  The legal basis for the processing of the Personal Data by the Company and the third-party service providers described
below is the necessity of the data processing for the Company to perform its contractual obligations under the Award Terms and for the Company’s legitimate
business interests of managing the Plan and generally administering employee equity awards.
 
Stock Plan Administration Service Providers.  The Company transfers Personal Data to the Equity Account Administrator, an independent stock plan
administrator with operations, relevant to the Company, in the United States, which assists the Company with the implementation, administration and
management of the Plan.  In the future, the Company may select a different service provider and may share Personal Data with such service providers.  The
Holder will be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider, which is a condition of the Holder’s ability to
participate in the Plan.  The Holder’s Personal Data will only be accessible by those individuals requiring access to it for purposes of implementing,
administering and operating the Holder’s participation in the Plan.  The Holder understands that the Holder may request a list with the names and addresses of
any potential recipients of Personal Data by contacting the Holder’s local human resources representative.
 
International Data Transfers.  The Company and its service providers, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator, operate, relevant to
the Company, in the United States, which means that it will be necessary for Personal Data to be transferred to, and processed in, the United States.  The
Holder understands and acknowledges that the United States is not subject to an unlimited adequacy finding by the European Commission and that the
Holder’s Personal Data may not have an equivalent level of protection as compared to the Holder’s country of work and/or residence.  To provide appropriate
safeguards for the protection of the Holder’s Personal Data, the Personal Data is transferred to the Company based on data transfer and processing agreements
implementing the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.  The Holder may request a copy of the safeguards used to protect his or her Personal Data by contacting
the Company at: employeeprivacy@activision.com.
 
Data Retention.  The Company will use the Personal Data only as long as necessary to implement, administer and manage the Holder’s participation in the
Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including tax and securities laws.  When the
 
B-6
 
Company no longer needs the Personal Data, the Company will remove it from its systems.  If the Company keeps data longer, it would be to satisfy legal or
regulatory obligations and the Company’s legal basis would be relevant laws or regulations.
 
Data Subject Rights.  To the extent provided by law, the Holder has the right to (i) inquire whether and what kind of Personal Data the Company holds about
the Holder and how it is processed, and to access or request copies of such Personal Data, (ii) request the correction or supplementation of Personal Data that
is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date in light of the purposes underlying the processing, (iii) obtain the erasure of Personal Data no longer necessary for the
purposes underlying the processing or processed in non-compliance with applicable legal requirements, (iv) request the Company to restrict the processing of
Personal Data in certain situations where the Holder feels its processing is inappropriate, (v) object, in certain circumstances, to the processing of Personal
Data for legitimate interests, (vi) request portability of Personal Data that the Holder has actively or passively provided to the Company, where the processing
of such Personal Data is based on consent or a contractual agreement with the Holder and is carried out by automated means, or (vii) lodge a complaint with
the competent local data protection authority.  To receive additional information regarding the Holder’s rights, raise any other questions regarding the
practices described in the Award Terms or to exercise his or her rights, the Holder should contact the Company at: employeeprivacy@activision.com.
 
Contractual Requirement.  The Holder’s provision of Personal Data and its processing as described above is a contractual requirement and a condition to
the Holder’s ability to participate in the Plan.  The Holder understands that, as a consequence of the Holder’s refusing to provide Personal Data, the Company
may not be able to allow the Holder to participate in the Plan, grant Stock Options to the Holder or administer or maintain such Stock Options.  However, the
Holder’s participation in the Plan and his or her acceptance of the Award Terms are purely voluntary.  While the Holder will not receive Stock Options if he or
she decides against participating in the Plan or providing Personal Data as described above, the Holder’s career and salary will not be affected in any way. 
For more information on the consequences of the refusal to provide Personal Data, the Holder may contact the Company at:
employeeprivacy@activision.com.

Consentement relatif à la langue utilisée: Les parties reconnaissent avoir exigé la rédaction en anglais de cette annexe, la convention afférente, ainsi que de

Securities Law Notification.  The Holder is permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the Equity Account Administrator, provided that the

Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement) if the total value of such foreign specified property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year. 
Foreign specified property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the Stock Option.  The Stock Option must be reported—generally at a nil
cost—if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign specified property the Holder holds.  If Shares are acquired, their cost generally is
the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares.  The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of the Shares at exercise, but if the Holder owns other
shares of the Company’s common stock, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of those other shares.  If due, the form must be filed by
April 30 of the following year.  The Holder should speak with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for
purposes of this requirement.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Nature of Grant.  This provision supplements the “Nature of Grant” Section of the Appendix:
 
By participating in the Plan, the Holder acknowledges that he or she understands and agrees that the grant of the Option relates to future services to be
performed and is not a bonus or compensation for past services.
 
NOTIFICATIONS
 
Exchange Control Notification.  The establishment of an account holding Shares or an account holding cash outside Denmark must be reported to the
Danish Tax Administration.  The form which should be used in this respect may be obtained from a local bank.  (Please note that these obligations are
separate from and in addition to the securities/tax reporting obligations described below.)
 
Securities/Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Notification.  The Holder must complete a “Form V” form in connection with the deposit of any securities
(including Shares acquired under the Plan) into a bank or brokerage account outside of Denmark.  The form is available at the website of the Danish Tax
Authorities.  In connection with filing the Form V with the Danish Tax Authorities, the broker or bank where the securities are deposited (the “depositary”)
may sign a statement according to which the depositary undertakes an obligation, without further request each year, to forward information concerning the
Shares on an annual basis to the Danish Tax Authorities.  However, if the depositary will not agree to sign such a statement, the Holder is personally
responsible for submitting the required information as an attachment to his or her annual tax return.
 
It is only necessary to submit a Form V form the first time securities are deposited with a specific depositary outside of Denmark.  However, if the securities
are transferred to a different depositary or if the Holder begins using a new depositary, a new Form V is required.
 
Generally, the Form V must be submitted by the depositary no later than February 1 of the year following the calendar year to which the information relates. 
However, if the Holder is responsible for submitting this information, the Holder must submit the required information as an attachment to his or her annual
tax return, whenever that is due.
 
In addition, if the Holder holds Shares or cash in an account outside Denmark, he or she is also required to report the existence of such an account to the
Danish Tax by completing a “Form K” form and submitting it to the Danish Tax Authorities following the opening of the account.  The form is available at
the website of the Danish Tax Authorities.  A separate form must be
 
B-14
 
submitted for each account held outside of Denmark that holds Shares or cash which are taxable in Denmark.  The Form K requirement is in addition to the
Form V requirement discussed above.  The Holder should consult with his or her personal legal advisor to ensure compliance with the applicable
requirements.
 
If the Holder uses the full cashless method of exercise, whereby upon exercise of the Stock Option, the Holder immediately sells all of the Shares being
purchased upon such exercise through a brokerage firm acceptable to the Company and the proceeds of such sale, less an amount in cash equal to the Exercise
Price for the Shares being so purchased, any Withholding Taxes and any brokers’ fees or commissions, are remitted to the Holder, the Holder will not be
required to file a Form V because he or she will not hold any Shares from such exercise thereafter.  However, if the Holder opens a deposit account with a
foreign broker or bank to hold the remaining cash proceeds of such sale, he or she will be required to file a Form K, as described above.  These obligations are
separate from and in addition to the obligations described above.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Nature of Grant. This provision supplements the “Nature of Grant” Section of the Appendix:
 
In accepting the Stock Option, the Holder consents to participate in the Plan and acknowledges having received and read a copy of the Plan.
 
The Holder understands that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant an Option under the Plan to individuals who may
be employees of the Company or any other entity in the Company Group throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon
the express assumption and condition that any grant will not bind the Company or any other entity in the Company Group.  Consequently, the Holder
understands that the Stock Option is granted on the assumption and condition that such Option and any Shares acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option
shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any other entity in the Company Group) and shall not be considered a
mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, the Holder understands that the
Stock Option would not granted but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, the Holder acknowledges and freely accepts that should any or
all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any grant of the Stock Option shall be null and void.
 
Further, the vesting of the Stock Options is expressly conditioned on the Holder’s active employment, such that if the Holder’s employment or service
terminates for any reason whatsoever, the Stock Options cease vesting immediately effective on the date of termination of employment.  This will be the case,
for example, even if the Holder (1) is considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); (2) is dismissed for
disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) terminates service due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or
contractual condition; (4) terminates service due to the Company’s or any entity in the Company Group’s unilateral breach of contract; or (5) is terminated
from employment for any other reason whatsoever.  Consequently, upon the Holder’s termination of employment for any of the above reasons, the Holder
may automatically lose any rights to Stock Options that were unvested on the date of termination.

however, if the value of the Shares acquired or sold exceeds €1,502,530 (or if the Holder holds 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other
amount that would entitle the Holder to join the Company’s board of directors), the declaration must be filed also within one month of the acquisition or sale,
as applicable.
 
The Holder is required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), and foreign

information regarding such rights and assets on tax form 720.  After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will only apply for
subsequent years if the value of any previously-reported rights or assets increases by more than €20,000.  If reporting is required, the reporting must be
completed by the following March 31.  The Holder should consult his or her personal tax advisor for details regarding this requirement.

was exercised and which were not sold.
 
2.                                      Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement, service
contract or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant
 
 
Notice or these Award Terms, the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the
terms of any employment agreement, service contract or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the
terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.
 
3.                                      Employment Violation.  The terms of this Section 3 shall apply to the Stock Option if the Holder is or becomes subject to an employment
agreement with any entity in the Company Group.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the termination
and cancellation of the Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, and (b) payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to
such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount, the Holder, in his or her
discretion, may tender to the Company the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option during the Look-back Period with respect to such Employment
Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such termination of the Stock Option and payment of the Recapture
Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy available to the Company arising out of or in connection with
such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate the Holder’s employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive
relief and additional monetary damages.

Exhibit 10.24
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
 
THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of the date signed by the Employer, between Activision Blizzard, Inc.
(the “Employer”) or (“Activision Blizzard” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Activision Blizzard Group”), and Dennis Durkin (“you”).
 
RECITAL
 
The Employer desires to employ you, and you desire to be so employed by the Employer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.
 
AGREEMENT
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises set forth in this Agreement, the Employer and you hereby agree as
follows:
 
1.                                      Term of Employment
 
The term of your employment under this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence as of January 2, 2019 (the “Effective Date”) and shall continue in
effect until terminated in accordance with Section 9 (below) of this Agreement.  All obligations and rights under this Agreement shall immediately lapse upon
termination except as set forth in Section 11(s).
 
2.                                      Compensation
 
(a)                                 Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, in full consideration for all rights and services provided by you under this Agreement, during
the Term you shall receive only the compensation set forth in this Section 2.
 
(b)                                 Commencing on the Effective Date, you shall receive an annual base salary (“Base Salary”) of $900,000, which shall be paid in
accordance with the Employer’s payroll policies.  Your Base Salary shall be reviewed periodically and may be increased by an amount determined by the
Employer, in its sole and absolute discretion.
 
(c)                                  You will be eligible to receive an annual discretionary bonus (the “Annual Bonus”).  Your target Annual Bonus for each calendar year will
be one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of your Base Salary.  In all instances, the actual amount of the Annual Bonus, if any, shall be determined by the
Employer, in its sole and absolute discretion, and may be based on, among other things, your base salary and target bonus, your overall performance and the
performance of the Employer and the Activision Blizzard Group.  The Annual Bonus, if any, will be paid (in cash or equity, with the form of payment at the
Employer’s election) at the same time bonuses for that year are generally paid or delivered to other executives, as determined by the Employer in its
discretion.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you must remain continuously employed by the Activision Blizzard Group through the date on
which an Annual Bonus, if any, is paid or vested to be eligible to receive such Annual Bonus.

(d)                                 Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Activision Blizzard (the “Compensation
Committee”), Activision Blizzard will grant to you equity awards with a total target grant value of $11,250,000 (and a total grant value of $14,062,500, if the
2019 Maximum PSU Grant Value (as defined below) and the 2019 Maximum EPS PSU Grant Value (as defined below) were achieved) as follows:
 
(i)                                     Activision Blizzard shall grant to you performance-vesting restricted share units which represent the conditional right to receive
shares of Activision Blizzard’s common stock (the “2019 Performance Share Units”), with a target value at the time of grant of
approximately $7,500,000 (the “2019 Target PSU Grant Value”).  The actual number of 2019 Performance Share Units awarded
to you on the grant date shall be equal to the 2019 Target PSU Grant Value divided by the official per share closing price of
Activision Blizzard’s common stock on the effective date of the grant, as reported by NASDAQ (the “Grant Date Price”) (it being
recognized that if the maximum performance objectives are met for all of the 2019 Performance Share Units, the value of the
shares received upon vesting for all of the 2019 Performance Share Units would have been $9,375,000 at the time of grant of the
2019 Performance Share Units, representing 125% of the 2019 Target PSU Grant Value (the “2019 Maximum PSU Grant
Value”)).  The number of 2019 Performance Share Units awarded shall be rounded to the nearest whole number and shall be
determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, and Activision Blizzard retains the discretion to modify the
methodology for such calculations as needed.  Subject to your remaining employed by the Activision Blizzard Group through the
applicable vesting dates, the actual number of shares of Activision Blizzard’s common stock (“Shares”) that shall be received on
each of the applicable vesting dates is determined as follows:
 
a.                                      One-half of the 2019 Performance Share Units (the “First Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units”) shall vest on
March 30, 2020, if, and only if, the Compensation Committee determines that non-GAAP operating income (calculated in
the same manner as the 2019 AOP OI Objective (as defined below)) for 2019 for Activision Blizzard (“2019 OI”) is 85%
or more of the annual operating plan operating income objective established by the Board of Directors for 2019 (the
“2019 AOP OI Objective”).  If the 2019 OI is less than 85% of the 2019 AOP OI Objective, then the First Tranche 2019
Performance Share Units will not vest and shall be forfeited.  If the 2019 OI is 85% or more of the 2019 AOP OI
Objective, the number of Shares that shall be received with regard to the First Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units on
the applicable vesting date shall be equal to the product of:  (1) the number of First Tranche 2019 Performance Share
Units; and (2) the ratio of the 2019 OI to the 2019 AOP OI Objective, up to a maximum of 125%.
 
2
 
b.                                      One-fourth of the 2019 Performance Share Units (the “Second Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units”) shall vest on
March 30, 2021, if, and only if, the Compensation Committee determines that non-GAAP operating income (calculated in
the same manner as the 2020 AOP OI Objective (as defined below)) for 2020 for Activision Blizzard (“2020 OI”) is 85%
or more of the annual operating plan operating income objective established by the Board of Directors for 2020 (the
“2020 AOP OI Objective”).  If the 2020 OI is less than 85% of the 2020 AOP OI Objective, then the Second Tranche
2019 Performance Share Units will not vest and shall be forfeited.  If the 2020 OI is 85% or more of the 2020 AOP OI
Objective, the number of Shares that shall be received with regard to the Second Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units
on the applicable vesting date shall be equal to the product of:  (1) the number of Second Tranche 2019 Performance
Share Units; and (2) the ratio of the 2020 OI to the 2020 AOP OI Objective, up to a maximum of 125%.
 
c.                                       One-fourth of the 2019 Performance Share Units (the “Third Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units”) shall vest on
March 30, 2021, if, and only if, the Compensation Committee determines that non-GAAP operating income (calculated in
the same manner as the 2020 AOP Division OI Objective (as defined below)) for 2020 for the Emerging Businesses
Division (“2020 Division OI”) is 85% or more of the annual operating plan operating income objective established by the
Board of Directors for 2020 for the Emerging Businesses Division (the “2020 AOP Division OI Objective”).  If the 2020
Division OI is less than 85% of the 2020 AOP Division OI Objective, then the Third Tranche 2019 Performance Share
Units will not vest and shall be forfeited.  If the 2020 Division OI is 85% or more of the 2020 AOP Division OI
Objective, the number of Shares that shall be received with regard to the Third Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units on
the applicable vesting date shall be equal to the product of:  (1) the number of Third Tranche 2019 Performance Share
Units; and (2) the ratio of the 2020 Division OI to the 2020 AOP Division OI Objective, up to a maximum of 125%.
 
(ii)                                  Activision Blizzard shall grant to you performance-vesting restricted share units which represent the conditional right to receive
shares of Activision Blizzard’s common stock (the “2019 EPS Performance Share Units”), with a target value at the time of grant
of approximately $3,750,000 (the “2019 Target EPS PSU Grant Value”).  The actual number of 2019 EPS Performance Share
Units awarded to you on the grant date shall be equal to the 2019 Target EPS PSU Grant Value divided by the Grant Date Price (it
being recognized that if the maximum performance objectives are met for all of the 2019 EPS Performance Share Units, the value
of the shares
 
3
 
received upon vesting for all of the 2019 EPS Performance Share Units would have been $4,687,500 at the time of grant of the
2019 EPS Performance Share Units, representing 125% of the 2019 Target EPS PSU Grant Value (the “2019 Maximum EPS PSU
Grant Value”)). The number of 2019 EPS Performance Share Units awarded shall be rounded to the nearest whole number and
shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, and Activision Blizzard retains the discretion to modify
the methodology for such calculations as needed.  Subject to your remaining employed by the Activision Blizzard Group through
the applicable vesting dates, the actual number of Shares that shall be received on the applicable vesting date is determined as
follows:
 
a.                                      The 2019 EPS Performance Share Units shall vest on March 30, 2021, if, and only if, the Compensation Committee
determines that non-GAAP earnings per share objective (calculated in the same manner as the 2020 EPS Objective (as
defined below)) for 2020 for Activision Blizzard (“2020 EPS”) is 90% or more of the annual operating plan non-GAAP
earnings per share (calculated in the same manner as the 2020 EPS Objective (as defined below)) established by the
Board of Directors for Activision Blizzard for 2020 (the “2020 EPS Objective”).  If the 2020 EPS is less than 90% of the
2020 EPS Objective, then the 2019 EPS Performance Share Units will not vest and shall be forfeited.  If the 2020 EPS is
90% or more of the 2020 EPS Objective, the number of Shares that shall be received with regard to the 2019 EPS
Performance Share Units on the vesting date shall be equal to the product of:  (1) the number of 2019 EPS Performance
Share Units; and (2) the ratio of the 2020 EPS to the 2020 EPS Objective, up to a maximum of 125%.
 
Prior to the vesting of any portion of the 2019 Performance Share Units, Activision Blizzard, in its sole discretion, may adjust the performance
objective for the relevant fiscal year(s) by substituting the OI and AOP OI Objective of a different or additional business unit for that of your original
business unit or by prorating or otherwise combining the OI and AOP OI Objective of the applicable business units, in each case for purposes of
determining whether or not the conditions of the unvested 2019 Performance Share Units have been satisfied.
 
Collectively, the 2019 Performance Share Units and the 2019 EPS Performance Share Units shall be referred to as the “2019 Equity Awards”.  You
acknowledge that the grant of 2019 Equity Awards pursuant to this Section 2(d) is expressly conditioned upon approval by the Compensation Committee and
that the Compensation Committee has discretion to approve or disapprove the grants and/or to determine and make modifications to the terms of the grants. 
The 2019 Equity Awards shall be subject to all terms of the equity incentive plan pursuant to which they are granted (the “Incentive Plan”), Activision
Blizzard’s standard forms of award agreement, and, in the event that Activision Blizzard determines that you are an Executive Officer within the meaning of
the Executive Ownership Guidelines of Activision Blizzard (as defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), the Employer’s Executive
Stock Ownership
 
4
 
Guidelines (including, but not limited to, all of the limitations on equity awards described therein) which are attached as Exhibit C, will apply.  In the event of
a conflict between this Agreement and the terms of the Incentive Plan or award agreements, the Incentive Plan or the award agreements, as applicable, shall
govern. These 2019 Equity Awards, if and when approved by the Compensation Committee, shall be in addition to any previous equity incentive awards
made to you.
 
(e)                                  Within three weeks of the Effective Date, the Employer will provide you with a sign on bonus in the amount of $3,750,000 (less applicable
taxes).  This bonus will not be fully earned by you until you have completed employment under this Agreement until December 31, 2019.  As such, should
your employment with the Employer terminate pursuant to Section 9(a) or due to your resignation pursuant to Section 9(b) prior to December 31, 2019, you
agree to repay the Employer 100% of this bonus on or within 60 days of the termination of your employment.  If (x) you remain employed by the Activision
Blizzard Group through December 31, 2019 or (y) your employment terminates prior to December 31, 2019 for any reason other than for Cause (as defined
in Section 9(a)) or due to your resignation, then the bonus shall be fully earned and you will not have to repay any portion of the bonus.  The fact that you
are receiving this bonus and the terms under which you will be required to repay the bonus in no way affect your other obligations under this Agreement.
 
3.                                      Title; Location
 
You shall serve as Chief Financial Officer of Activision Blizzard and the President of its Emerging Businesses Division.  Your principal place of
business initially shall be the Employer’s headquarters in Santa Monica, California; provided, however, that you acknowledge and agree that you may be
required to travel from time to time for business reasons.
 
4.                                      Duties
 
You shall report directly to the Employer’s Chief Executive Officer (or, after meaningful consultation between the Employer’s Chief Executive
Officer or his designee and you such other executive of the Activision Blizzard Group as may be determined from time to time by it in its discretion) and shall
have such duties commensurate with your position as may be assigned to you from time to time by the Employer’s Chief Executive Officer (or, as applicable,
such other executive designated by the Employer).  You are also required to read, review and observe all of the Activision Blizzard Group’s policies,
procedures, rules and regulations in effect from time to time during the Term that apply to employees of the Employer, including, without limitation, the Code
of Conduct, as amended from time to time.  You shall devote your full-time working time to the performance of your duties hereunder, shall faithfully serve
the Employer, shall in all respects conform to and comply with the lawful directions and instructions given to you by the Employer’s Chief Executive Officer
(or such other executive of the Activision Blizzard Group as may be determined from time to time by the Employer in its sole and absolute discretion) and
shall use your best efforts to promote and serve the interests of the Activision Blizzard Group.  Further, you shall at all times place the Employer’s interests
above your own, not take any actions that would conflict with the Employer’s interests and shall perform all your duties for the Employer with the highest
duty of care.  Further, you shall not, directly or indirectly, render services of any kind to any other person or organization, whether on your own behalf or on
behalf of others, without the
 
5
 
consent of the Employer’s Chief Executive Officer or otherwise engage in activities that would interfere with your faithful and diligent performance of your
duties hereunder; provided, however, that you may serve on civic or charitable boards or engage in charitable activities without remuneration if doing so is
not inconsistent with, or adverse to, your employment hereunder.
 
5.                                      Expenses
 
To the extent you incur necessary and reasonable travel or other business expenses in the course of your employment, you shall be reimbursed for
such expenses, upon presentation of written documentation in accordance with the Employer’s policies in effect from time to time.
 
6.                                      Other Benefits
 
(a)                                 You shall be eligible to participate in all health, welfare, retirement, pension, life insurance, disability, perquisite and similar plans,
programs and arrangements generally available to executives of the Employer from time to time during the Term, subject to the then-prevailing terms,
conditions and eligibility requirements of each such plan, program, or arrangement.  In addition to the foregoing benefits, Employer will provide you during
the Term, at Employer’s expense, with a supplemental term life insurance policy with a face amount of $3,000,000 through a carrier of Employer’s choice
(the “Target Face Amount”), subject to your insurability.  If it is determined that you are insurable at a higher cost than a healthy individual of like age, the
face amount of such insurance coverage will be reduced to the maximum face amount of coverage that may be obtained for the cost of coverage of the
Target Face Amount for such healthy individual.
 
(b)                                 You expressly agree and acknowledge that, after the termination of your employment, you shall not be entitled to any additional benefits,
except as specifically provided in this Agreement and the benefit plans in which you participate during the Term, and subject in each case to the then-
prevailing terms and conditions of each such plan.
 
7.                                      Vacation and Paid Holidays
 
(a)                                 You will generally be entitled to paid vacation days in accordance with the normal vacation policies of the Employer in effect from time to
time; provided, however, that you will be entitled to take and accrue no less than twenty (20) paid vacation days per year,  unless your vacation accrual
balance exceeds the Employer’s then-current maximum accrual cap, in which case you shall cease accruing vacation leave until your accrual balance has
fallen below the cap again.
 
(b)                                 You shall be entitled to all paid holidays allowed by the Employer to its full-time employees in the United States.
 
8.                                      Protection of the Employer’s Interests
 
(a)                                 Duty of Loyalty.  During the Term, you will owe a “Duty of Loyalty” to the Employer, which includes, but is not limited to, you not
competing in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, as a principal, employee, agent, owner, or otherwise, with any entity in the Activision Blizzard
Group; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8(a) will limit your right to own up to five percent (5%) of any of the debt or equity securities of any
business
 
6
 
organization that is then required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.
 
(b)                                 Property of the Activision Blizzard Group.  All rights worldwide with respect to any and all intellectual or other property of any nature
produced, created or suggested by you, whether on your own time or not, alone or with others, during the term of your employment or resulting from your
services which (i) relate in any manner at the time of conception or reduction to practice to the actual or demonstrably anticipated business of the Activision
Blizzard Group, (ii) result from or are suggested by any task assigned to you or any work performed by you on behalf of the Activision Blizzard Group,
(iii) were created using the time or resources of the Activision Blizzard Group, or (iv) are based on any property owned or idea conceived by the Activision
Blizzard Group, shall be deemed to be a work made for hire and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Activision Blizzard Group.  You agree to
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Employer, at the Employer’s request, such further documents, including copyright and patent assignments, as the
Employer finds appropriate to evidence the Activision Blizzard Group’s rights in such property.  Your agreement to assign to the Activision Blizzard Group
any of your rights as set forth in this Section 8(b) shall not apply to any invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of California Labor Code
Section 2870, where no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of the Activision Blizzard Group was used, where the invention was
developed entirely upon your own time, where the invention does not relate to the Activision Blizzard Group’s business, and where the invention does not
result from any work performed by you for the Activision Blizzard Group.
 
(c)                                  Confidentiality.  You acknowledge, and the Employer agrees, that during your employment you will have access to and become informed
of confidential and proprietary information concerning the Activision Blizzard Group.  During your employment and at all times following the termination
of your employment, confidential or proprietary information of any entity in the Activision Blizzard Group shall not be used by you or disclosed or made
available by you to any person except as required in the course of your employment with the Activision Blizzard Group or as otherwise provided for in the
Employee Confidential Information Agreement attached as Exhibit A hereto (the “Confidential Information Agreement”).  Upon the termination of your
employment (or at any time on the Employer’s request), you shall return to the Activision Blizzard Group all such information that exists, whether in
electronic, written, or other form (and all copies or extracts thereof) under your control and shall not retain such information in any form, including without
limitation on any devices, disks or other media.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge signing and delivering to the Employer
the Confidential Information Agreement as of the Effective Date and you agree that all terms and conditions contained in such agreement, and all of your
obligations and commitments provided for in such agreement, shall be deemed, and hereby are, incorporated into this Agreement as if set forth in full herein.
 
(d)                                 Return of Property and Resignation from Office.  You acknowledge that, upon termination of your employment for any reason
whatsoever (or at any time on the Employer’s request), you will promptly deliver to the Activision Blizzard Group or surrender to the Activision Blizzard
Group’s representative all property of any entity in the Activision Blizzard Group, including, without limitation, all documents and other materials (and all
copies thereof) relating to the Activision Blizzard Group’s business, all identification and access cards, all contact lists
 
7
 
and third party business cards however and wherever preserved, and any equipment provided by any entity in the Activision Blizzard Group, including,
without limitation, computers, telephones, personal digital assistants, memory cards and similar devices that you possess or have in your custody or under
your control. You will cooperate with the Activision Blizzard Group by participating in interviews to share any knowledge you may have regarding the
Activision Blizzard Group’s intellectual or other property with personnel designated by the Activision Blizzard Group.  You also agree to resign from any
office held by you within the Activision Blizzard Group immediately upon termination of your employment for any reason whatsoever (or at any time on the
Employer’s request) and you irrevocably appoint any person designated as the Activision Blizzard Group’s representative at that time as your delegate to
effect such resignation.
 
(e)                                  Covenant Not to Solicit.
 
(i)                                     During your employment, you shall not, at any time or for any reason, either alone or jointly, with or on behalf of others, whether
as principal, partner, agent, representative, equity holder, director, employee, consultant or otherwise, directly or indirectly:
(a) offer employment to, or solicit the employment or engagement of, or otherwise entice away from the employment or
engagement of the Activision Blizzard Group, either for your own account or for any other person, firm or company, any person
employed or otherwise engaged by any entity in the Activision Blizzard Group, whether or not such person would commit any
breach of a contract by reason of his or her leaving the service of the Activision Blizzard Group; or (b) solicit, induce or entice any
client, customer, contractor, licensor, agent, supplier, partner or other business relationship of any entity in the Activision Blizzard
Group to terminate, discontinue, renegotiate or otherwise cease or modify its relationship with the Activision Blizzard Group.
 
(ii)                                  For a period of two (2) years following the termination of your employment for any reason whatsoever, you shall not, at any time
or for any reason, either alone or jointly, with or on behalf of others, whether as principal, partner, agent, representative, equity
holder, director, employee, consultant or otherwise, directly or indirectly solicit the employment or engagement of, either for your

Blizzard Group, whether or not such person would commit any breach of a contract by reason of his or her leaving the service of
the Activision Blizzard Group.
 
(iii)                               During your employment and at all times following the termination of your employment for any reason whatsoever, you shall not,
at any time or for any reason, use the confidential, trade secret information of the Activision Blizzard Group or any other unlawful
means to directly or indirectly solicit, induce or entice any client, customer, contractor, licensor, agent, supplier, partner or other
business relationship of any entity in the Activision Blizzard
 
8
 
Group to terminate, discontinue, renegotiate or otherwise cease or modify its relationship with the Activision Blizzard Group.
 
(iv)                              You expressly acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this Section 8(e) are reasonably tailored to protect the
Activision Blizzard Group’s confidential information and trade secrets and to ensure that you do not violate your Duty of Loyalty
or any other fiduciary duty to the Employer, and are reasonable in all circumstances in scope, duration and all other respects. The
provisions of this Section 8(e) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.
 
9.                                      Termination of Employment
 
(a)                                 By the Employer for Cause.
 
(i)                                     At any time (and, without notice, unless provided for below in Section 9(a)(ii) below), the Employer may terminate your
employment for “Cause,” which shall mean a reasonable and good-faith determination by the Employer that you (i) engaged in
gross negligence in the performance of your duties or willfully and continuously failed or refused to perform any duties reasonably
requested in the course of your employment; (ii) engaged in fraud, dishonesty, or any other serious misconduct that causes or has
the potential to cause, harm to any entity in the Activision Blizzard Group, including its business or reputation; (iii) materially
violated any lawful directives or policies of the Activision Blizzard Group or any laws, rules or regulations applicable to your
employment with the Activision Blizzard Group; (iv) materially breached this Agreement; (v) materially breached any proprietary
information or confidentiality agreement with any entity in the Activision Blizzard Group; (vi) were convicted of, or pled guilty or
no contest to, a felony or crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; or (vii) materially breached your fiduciary duties to the
Activision Blizzard Group.
 
(ii)                                  In the case of any termination for Cause that is curable without any residual damage (financial or otherwise) to the Employer or
any entity in the Activision Blizzard Group, the Employer shall give you at least thirty (30) days written notice of its intent to
terminate your employment; provided, that in no event shall any termination pursuant to clause (vi) of the definition of Cause be
deemed curable.  The notice shall specify (x) the effective date of your termination and (y) the particular acts or circumstances that
constitute Cause for such termination.  You shall be given the opportunity within fifteen (15) days after receiving the notice to
explain why Cause does not exist or to cure any basis for Cause (other than a termination pursuant to clause (vi) of the definition
thereof).  Within fifteen (15) days after any such explanation or cure, the Employer will make its final determination regarding
whether Cause exists and deliver such determination to you in writing.  If the final decision is that Cause exists and no cure has
occurred,
 
9
 
your employment with the Employer shall be terminated for Cause as of the date of termination specified in the original notice.  If
the final decision is that Cause does not exist or a cure has occurred, your employment with the Employer shall not be terminated
for Cause at that time.
 
(iii)                               If your employment terminates for any reason other than a termination by the Employer for Cause, at a time when the Employer
had Cause to terminate you (or would have had Cause if it then knew all relevant facts) under clauses (i), (ii), (v), (vi) or (vii) of
the definition of Cause, your termination shall be treated as a termination by the Employer for Cause.
 
(b)                                 By Either Party Without Cause.  Either party may terminate your employment  without Cause at any time, provided that each party shall
provide the other with at least 60 days’ prior written notice in the event of such termination.
 
(c)                                        Death.  In the event of your death during the Term, your employment shall terminate immediately as of the date of your death.
 
10.                               Termination of Obligations and Severance Payments
 
(a)                           General.  Upon the termination of your employment, your rights and the Employer’s obligations to you under this Agreement shall
immediately terminate except as provided in this Section 10 and Section 11(s).  The payments and benefits provided pursuant to this Section 10 are deemed
to satisfy and be in full and final settlement of all obligations of the Activision Blizzard Group to you.  You shall have no further right to receive any other
compensation or benefits following your termination of employment for any reason except as set forth in this Section 10.
 
(b)                           Termination by the Employer for Cause.  In the event of termination of your employment by the Employer for Cause, then:
 
(i)                                     you shall be entitled to Basic Severance (as defined below); and
 
(ii)                                  all outstanding equity awards shall cease to vest and, whether or not vested, shall no longer be exercisable and shall be cancelled
immediately.
 
(c)                                  Qualifying Termination.  Subject to Section 10(f), in the event of termination of your employment in a Qualifying Termination (as defined
below), then:
 
(i)                                     you shall be entitled to Basic Severance (as defined below);
 
(ii)                                  you shall be entitled to the Bonus Severance (as defined below) at the same time you would have received the Annual Bonus had a
Qualifying Termination not occurred;
 
(iii)                               you shall receive Salary Continuation (as defined below); and
 
10
 
(iv)                              all outstanding equity awards shall cease to vest.  All vested equity awards shall be administered in accordance with the applicable
incentive plans and award agreements.  All equity awards that are not vested as of the date of termination of your employment will
be cancelled immediately.
 
(d)                                 Termination by Employer other than for Cause or Resignation by You as a result of a Change of Location.  Subject to 10(f), in the
event of a termination of your employment by the Employer not for Cause or by you as a result of a Change of Location (as defined below), under
circumstances which do not constitute a Qualifying Termination, then:
 
(i)                                     you shall be entitled to Basic Severance (as defined below);
 
(ii)                                  all outstanding equity awards shall cease to vest.  All vested equity shall be administered in accordance with the applicable
incentive plans and award agreements.  All equity awards that are not vested as of the date of termination of your employment will
be cancelled immediately; and
 
(iii)                               you shall receive Salary Continuation.
 
(e)                                  Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
(i)                                     “Basic Severance” shall mean payment of (A) any Base Salary earned but unpaid as of the date of termination of your
employment; (B) any business expenses incurred (and submitted for reimbursement) but not reimbursed as of the date of
termination of your employment; and (C) payment in lieu of any vacation accrued under Section 7 but unused as of the date of
termination of your employment.
 
(ii)                                  “Bonus Severance” shall mean payment of an amount equal to the Annual Bonus that the Employer determines, in its sole
discretion, you would have received in accordance with Section 2(c) for the year that ended immediately prior the date of your
Qualifying Termination had you remained employed through the date such bonus would have otherwise been paid.
 
(iii)                               “Salary Continuation” shall mean the payment of an amount equal to three months of Base Salary (at the rate in effect on the
termination date) that you would have received had you remained employed through the date which is three months after the
effective date of your termination of employment (the “Salary Continuation Period”), which amount shall be paid in three equal
installments commencing on the first payroll date following the 60 day following the termination date in accordance with the
Employer’s payroll practices in effect on the termination date, provided that the first such payment shall include any installments
relating to the 60 day period following the Termination Date.
 
11th

 
(iv)                              “Qualifying Termination” shall mean a termination of your employment by the Employer without Cause or by you as a result of a
Change in Location, in either case, where you have been an employee in good standing during the entire prior year, but your
termination becomes effective prior to the payment of that prior year’s Annual Bonus (e.g., where you have been an employee in
good standing during the entirety of 2019 and the Employer terminates you without Cause or you resign as a result of a Change in
Location, in either case, with an effective date of January 30, 2020, before the bonus payment with respect to 2019 has been paid).
 
(v)                                 “Change of Location” shall mean, without your written agreement or other voluntary action on your part, the Employer reassigns
your principal place of business to a location that is more than thirty-five (35) miles from your principal place of business as of the
Effective Date and that materially and adversely affects your commute; provided, however, that you must (i) provide the Employer
with written notice of your intent to terminate your employment under this Section and a description of the event you believe gives
you the right to do so within thirty (30) days after the initial existence of the event and (ii) the Employer shall have ninety (90)
days after you provide the notice described above to cure any such default (the “Cure Period”).  You will have five (5) days
following the end of the Cure Period to terminate your employment, after which your ability to terminate your employment under
this Section will no longer exist.
 
(f)                                   Severance Conditioned Upon Release.  Payments of Bonus Severance and Salary Continuation, as applicable, are conditioned upon your
execution of a waiver and release in a form prepared by the Employer and that release becoming effective and irrevocable in its entirety within 60 days
following the date of your termination of employment.  Unless otherwise provided by the Employer, if the release referenced above does not become
effective and irrevocable on or prior to the 60th day following the date of your termination of employment, you shall not be entitled to any payments of
Bonus Severance or Salary Continuation, as the case may be.
 
(g)                                  Other Terminations.  In the event your employment terminates due to death, disability or your resignation (other than due to a Change of
Location), then
 
(i)                                     you shall be entitled to Basic Severance; and
 
(ii)                                  all outstanding equity awards shall cease to vest.  All vested equity awards shall be administered in accordance with the applicable
incentive plans and award agreements.  All equity awards that are not vested as of the date of termination of your employment will
be cancelled immediately.
 
12
 
(h)                                 Breach of Post-Termination Obligations or Subsequent Employment.
 
(i)                                     Breach of Post-Termination Obligations.  In the event that you materially breach any of your obligations under Section 8, the
Employer’s obligation, if any, to make payments of Bonus Severance and Salary Continuation, as applicable, shall immediately
and permanently cease and you shall not be entitled to any such payments.
 
(ii)                                  Subsequent Employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if, at any time during the Salary
Continuation Period, you obtain subsequent employment and/or provide services of any kind for compensation, whether as
principal, owner, partner, agent, shareholder, director, employee, consultant, advisor or otherwise, to any person, company, venture
or other person or business entity, you must promptly notify the Employer and Salary Continuation payments shall be refunded by
you to the Employer (to the extent already paid) and shall be offset (to the extent payable in the future) by the amount of Base
Compensation (as defined below) earned by, paid to, or granted to you during or with respect to the Salary Continuation Period. 
“Base Compensation” shall mean the amount of your base salary or, if applicable, wages you earn (or are paid or granted) during
or with respect to any subsequent employment or services arrangement; provided, however, that such base salary or wages shall be
deemed, in all cases, to equal no less than 35% of the total compensation (including, without limitation, any and all amounts of
salary, bonus and all other kinds of cash or in-kind or equity-based compensation) you earn, are paid, or are granted during or with
respect to such subsequent employment or services arrangement and which are paid to you, vest or otherwise accrue with respect
to services performed by you, during or with respect to the Salary Continuation Period.
 
11.                               General Provisions
 
(a)                                 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the Confidential Information Agreement, the Activision Blizzard Group Dispute
Resolution Agreement (the “Dispute Resolution Agreement”, as referenced in Section 11(k) below), and the Employer’s Executive Stock Ownership
Guidelines, supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and statements, whether written or oral, concerning the terms of your employment with the
Activision Blizzard Group, and no amendment or modification of these agreements shall be binding unless it is set forth in a writing signed by both the
Employer and you.  To the extent that this Agreement conflicts with any of the Employer’s policies, procedures, rules or regulations, this Agreement shall
supersede the other policies, procedures, rules or regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge that this Agreement
supersedes any prior written, but expired, employment agreement with the Activision Blizzard Group, and such agreement(s) is (are) hereby terminated and
of no further force and effect.
 
13
 
(b)                                 Use of Employee’s Name and Likeness.  You hereby irrevocably grant the Activision Blizzard Group the right, but not the obligation, to
use your name or likeness in any product made by the Activision Blizzard Group or for any publicity or advertising purpose in any medium now known or
hereafter existing.
 
(c)                                  Assignment.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by you without the prior
written consent of the Employer.  The Employer may assign this Agreement or all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement at any time
to any member of the Activision Blizzard Group or to a successor to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Employer and following such
assignment all references to the Employer shall be deemed to refer to such assignee and the Employer shall thereafter have no obligation under this
Agreement.
 
(d)                                 No Conflict with Prior Agreements.  You represent to the Employer that neither your commencement of employment under this
Agreement nor the performance of your duties under this Agreement conflicts or will conflict with any contractual or legal commitment on your part to any
third party, nor does it or will it violate or interfere with any rights of any third party.  If you have acquired any confidential or proprietary information in the
course of your prior employment or otherwise in connection with your provision of services to any entity outside the Activision Blizzard Group, during the
Term you will fully comply with any duties to such entity then-applicable to you not to disclose or otherwise use such information.
 
(e)                                  Successors.  This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Employer and its successors and assigns, including
successors by merger and operation of law.  This Agreement shall also be binding on and inure to the benefit of you and your heirs, executors, administrators
and legal representatives.
 
(f)                                   Waiver.  No waiver by you or the Employer at any time of any breach by the other party of, or compliance with, any condition or
provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at
any prior or subsequent time.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be implied from any course of dealing between or among the parties
hereto or from any failure by any party hereto to assert its rights hereunder on any occasion or series of occasions.
 
(g)                                  Expiration.  This Agreement does not constitute a commitment of the Employer with regard to your employment, express or implied,
other than to the extent expressly provided for herein.  Upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9, neither the Employer nor you shall
have any obligation to the other with respect to your continued employment.
 
(h)                                 Taxation.  The Employer may withhold from any payments made under the Agreement all federal, state, city or other applicable taxes or
amounts as shall be required or permitted pursuant to any law, governmental regulation or ruling or agreement with you.
 
(i)                                     Immigration.  In accordance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, employment under this Agreement is conditioned
upon satisfactory proof of your identity and legal ability to work in the United States.
 
14
 
(j)                                    Choice of Law.  Except to the extent governed by federal law, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California or whatever other state in which you were last employed by the Employer, without regard to conflict of law principles.
 
(k)                                 Arbitration.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, both parties agree that any dispute or controversy between them will be
settled by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Dispute Resolution Agreement (attached hereto as Exhibit B).
 
(l)                                     Severability.  It is expressly agreed by the parties that each of the provisions included in Section 8(e) is separate, distinct, and severable
from the other and remaining provisions of Section 8(e), and that the invalidity or unenforceability of any Section 8(e) provision shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of any other provision or provisions of this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable
under, or would require the commission of any act contrary to, existing or future laws effective during the Term, such provisions shall be fully severable, the
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement, and the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by
its severance from this Agreement.  Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as part of this
Agreement a legal and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.
 
(m)                             Services Unique.  You recognize that the services being performed by you under this Agreement are of a special, unique, unusual,
extraordinary and intellectual character giving them a peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for in damages in
the event of a breach of this Agreement by you.
 
(n)                                 Injunctive Relief.  In the event of a breach of or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement regarding the exclusivity of your
services and the provisions of Section 8, you agree that any remedy at law would be inadequate.  Accordingly, you agree that the Employer is entitled to
obtain injunctive relief for such breaches or threatened breaches in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The injunctive relief provided for in Exhibit B and
this Section 11(n) is in addition to, and is not in limitation of, any and all other remedies at law or in equity otherwise available to the applicable party.  The
parties agree to waive the requirement of posting a bond in connection with a court or arbitrator’s issuance of an injunction.
 
(o)                                 Remedies Cumulative.  The remedies in this Agreement are not exclusive, and the parties shall have the right to pursue any other legal or
equitable remedies to enforce the terms of this Agreement.
 
(p)                                 Headings.  The headings set forth herein are included solely for the purpose of identification and shall not be used for the purpose of
construing the meaning of the provisions of this Agreement.
 
15
 
(q)                                 Section 409A.  To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A (“Section 409A”) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Code”).  The Agreement will be administered and
interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause the Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A will have no force and
effect until amended to comply therewith (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A).  Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, to the extent any payment under this Agreement is subject to Section 409A, you shall not be considered to have terminated
employment with the Employer for purposes of the Agreement and no payments shall be due to you under the Agreement which are payable upon your
termination of employment unless you would be considered to have incurred a “separation from service” from the Employer within the meaning of
Section 409A.  To the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be
payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to the Agreement during the six-month period immediately following your termination of
employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following your termination of employment (or upon your death, if
earlier).  In addition, for purposes of the Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided to you pursuant to the Employment Agreement shall be
construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A.  With respect to expenses eligible for reimbursement under the terms of the
Agreement, (i) the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement in any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in another
taxable year and (ii) any reimbursements of such expenses shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
related expenses were incurred, except, in each case, to the extent that the right to reimbursement does not provide for a “deferral of compensation” within the
meaning of Section 409A; provided, however that with respect to any reimbursements for any taxes to which you become entitled under the terms of the
Agreement, the payment of such reimbursements shall be made by the Employer no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in
which you remit the related taxes.
 
(r)                                    Section 280G.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that any amount, equity awards or
benefits paid or distributed to you pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement, plan or arrangement between the Employer or its subsidiaries or
affiliates, on the one hand, and you on the other hand (collectively, the “280G Payments”) (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this provision would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then the
280G Payments shall be payable either (A) in full, notwithstanding that some or all portion of such payment may be subject to the Excise Tax or (B) in such
lesser amount that would result in no portion of such 280G Payments being subject to Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account
the applicable federal, state and local income or excise taxes (including the Excise Tax) results in your receipt on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of
payments and benefits under this Agreement, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such payments and benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of
the Code.  Subject to Section 11(q),  in the event a reduction in a 280G Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence, payments shall be reduced in
the following order:  (1) cash payments; (2) any equity awards accelerated or otherwise valued at full value, provided such equity awards are not permitted
to be valued under Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1 Q/A — 24(c); (3) acceleration of vesting of all other stock options and equity awards; (4) any
other non-cash
 
16
 
forms of benefits, and (5) within any category, reductions shall be from the last due payment to the first.  All determinations required to be made under this
Section 11(r), including whether you will receive a full payment or a reduced payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination,
shall be made by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Employer and reasonably acceptable to you (the
“Accounting Firm”), which Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Employer and you within fifteen (15) business days
of the receipt of notice from the Employer that there is or may be made a 280G Payment or such other time as requested by you or the Employer.  All fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Employer.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the
Employer and you.
 
(s)                                   Survivability.  The provisions of Sections 2(c) (only the last sentence), 8, 10, 11 and 12, as well as Exhibits A through C, shall survive the
termination or expiration of this Agreement.
 
(t)                                    Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and both of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
(u)                                 Legal Counsel.  You acknowledge that you have been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel or any other advisor of your
own choosing regarding this Agreement.  Employer will reimburse you, up to $30,000, for costs associated with retention of your legal counsel in this
regard.  You understand and agree that any attorney retained by the Employer, the Activision Blizzard Group or any member of management who has
discussed any term or condition of this Agreement with you or your advisor is only acting on behalf of the Employer and not on your behalf.
 
(v)                                 Right to Negotiate.  You hereby acknowledge that you have been given the opportunity to participate in the negotiation of the terms of
this Agreement.  You acknowledge and confirm that you have read this Agreement and fully understand its terms and contents.
 
(w)                               No Broker.  You have given no indication, representation or commitment of any nature to any broker, finder, agent or other third party to
the effect that any fees or commissions of any nature are, or under any circumstances might be, payable by the Activision Blizzard Group in connection with
your employment under this Agreement.
 
12.                               Indemnification
 
The Employer agrees that it shall indemnify and hold you harmless to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law from and against any and all
third-party liabilities, costs and claims, and all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by you in connection therewith by reason of the fact that you are or
were employed by the Activision Blizzard Group, including, without limitation, all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by you in defense of
litigation arising out of your employment hereunder.

4.                                      Tax Withholding.
 
(a)                                 Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any Withholding Taxes related to Grantee’s
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Grantee, Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Withholding Taxes is and remains Grantee’s
responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  Grantee further acknowledges that the Company
and/or the Employer (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Withholding Taxes in connection with any aspect of the
Performance Share Units, including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or payment of the Award, the subsequent sale of Vested
 
 
Shares acquired, and the receipt of any dividends; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the
Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate Grantee’s liability for Withholding Taxes or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if Grantee is subject to
tax in more than one jurisdiction, Grantee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to
withhold or account for Withholding Taxes in more than one jurisdiction.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver any Vested Shares unless and
until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 4 have been satisfied.
 
(b)                                 The Company shall determine the method or methods Grantee may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the vesting
of any Performance Share Units, the issuance or transfer of any Vested Shares or otherwise in connection with the Award at the time such Withholding Taxes
become due, which may include any of the following:  (i) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds; (ii) through the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, that the Company withhold Vested Shares
otherwise then deliverable having a value equal to the aggregate amount of the Withholding Taxes (valued in the same manner used in computing the amount
of such Withholding Taxes); (iii) arranging for the sale, on Grantee’s behalf, of Vested Shares otherwise then deliverable to Grantee (valued in the same
manner used in computing the amount of such Withholding Taxes); or (iv) by any combination of (i), (ii) or (iii) above.  Further, any entity in the Company
Group shall have the right to require Grantee to satisfy any Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 4 by any of the aforementioned methods or by
withholding from Grantee’s wages or other cash compensation.
 
(c)                                  The Company Group may withhold or account for Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 4 by reference to applicable
withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable statutory rates in Grantee’s jurisdiction(s) of employment and/or residency, and if the
Company Group withholds more than the amount necessary to satisfy the liability, Grantee may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and
will have no entitlement to the equivalent Shares.  If the obligation for Withholding Taxes is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Grantee will
be deemed to have been issued the full number of Vested Shares underlying the Performance Share Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held
back solely for the purpose of paying the Withholding Taxes.  No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the settlement of the Performance
Share Units and the Withholding Taxes thereunder.
 
5.                                      Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, Grantee is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
6.                                      Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon vesting of the Performance Share Units such
number of Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon vesting thereof.
 
7.                                      Dividend Equivalents. The holder of the Performance Share Units shall not be entitled to receive any payment, payment-in-kind or any
equivalent with regard to any cash or other dividends that are declared and paid on Common Shares.
 
 
8.                                      Receipt and Delivery.  As soon as administratively practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) after any Performance Share Units vest,
the Company shall (a) effect the issuance or transfer of the resulting Vested Shares, (b) cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to be evidenced
on the books and records of the Company, and (c) cause such Vested Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of the
person entitled to such Vested Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided,
however, that, in the event such Vested Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 16 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate
evidencing such Vested Shares and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
9.                                      Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of Grantee taken as a whole without Grantee’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may amend
the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 10 hereof) affecting any
entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of the
Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to prevent
the Award from becoming subject to any adverse consequences under Section 409A.
 
10.                               Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Grantee that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
11.                               Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or transfer
any Performance Share Units or Vested Shares, and no Performance Share Units or Vested Shares may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated
or otherwise disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless
 
 
such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the
registration, qualification or listing of, Performance Share Units or Vested Shares with the SEC, any state securities commission or any securities exchange,
securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such compliance.  Grantee shall make such representations and furnish such information as
may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
relating to Performance Share Units or Vested Shares, to issue or transfer Performance Share Units or Vested Shares in compliance with the provisions of that
or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to register the
issuance or transfer of Performance Share Units or Vested Shares or resale of Performance Share Units or Vested Shares under the Securities Act or any
comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities law.
 
12.                               Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and only with the Company’s consent, Grantee may transfer Performance Share Units for
estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that any transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in connection with such
transfer; and provided, further that Grantee will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.  Except as
otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 12, the Performance Share Units shall not be transferable by Grantee other than by will or the laws of
descent and distribution.
 
13.                               Employment Violation.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the forfeiture by Grantee
to the Company of any outstanding Performance Share Units or Vested Shares which have yet to settle pursuant to Section 8 hereof and (b) payment by
Grantee to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of payment by Grantee to the
Company of the Recapture Amount, Grantee, in his or her discretion, may tender to the Company the Vested Shares acquired during the Look-back Period
with respect to such Employment Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such forfeiture of Performance Share
Units and payment of the Recapture Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy available to the
Company arising out of or in connection with such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate Grantee’s employment if not
already terminated and to seek injunctive relief and additional monetary damages.
 
14.                               Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)                                 Grantee is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to Grantee in connection with the
Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)                                 The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by Grantee in connection with the
 
 
Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain Financial Restatements.
 
(c)                                  [The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines and the limitations
contained therein on the ability of Grantee to transfer any Vested Shares.]
 
15.                               Section 409A.
 
(a)                                 Payments contemplated with respect to the Award are intended to comply with Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject
to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (ii) if any provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith
judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the imposition on Grantee or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of Grantee, in the manner
that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties;
provided, however, that this Section 15 does not create an obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no
event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by Grantee pursuant to
Section 409A.
 
(b)                                 Neither Grantee nor any of Grantee’s creditors or beneficiaries shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within
the meaning of Section 409A) payable with respect to the Award to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment
or garnishment.  Except as permitted under Section 409A, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) payable to Grantee or for
Grantee’s benefit with respect to the Award may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by Grantee to the Company.
 
(c)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if (i) the Committee determines in good faith that the Performance
Share Units do not qualify for the “short-term deferral exception” under Section 409A, (ii) Grantee is a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A)
and (iii) a delay in the issuance or transfer of Vested Shares to Grantee or his or her estate or beneficiaries hereunder by reason of Grantee’s “separation from
service” (as defined in Section 409A) with any entity in the Company Group is required to avoid tax penalties under Section 409A but is not already provided
for by this Award, the Company shall cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to Grantee or Grantee’s estate or beneficiary upon the earlier of
(A) the date that is the first business day following the date that is six months after the date of Grantee’s separation from service and (B) Grantee’s death.
 
 
16.                               Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Vested
Shares to bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’), OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
17.                               No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be construed to confer upon
Grantee any right to be continued in the employ of any entity in the Company Group or derogate from any right of any entity in the Company Group to retire,
request the resignation of, or discharge Grantee at any time, with or without Cause.
 
18.                               No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of Performance Share Units shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to
any right of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable
against the Company except to the extent set forth in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
19.                               Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
20.                               Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)                                 For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Performance Share Units or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such
litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of
California, and no other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Performance Share Units is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)                                 To the extent that federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the Grant
Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
 
21.                               Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and Grantee and, to the extent applicable, Grantee’s permitted assigns under Section 12 hereof and Grantee’s estate or
beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
22.                               Notices.

23.                               Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Employment Agreement and the terms
of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and/or the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Employment Agreement [(with the exception of Section 12
(“Shareholder Value Creation Incentive”) thereof)], shall control.
 
24.                               Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Grantee’s participation in the Plan, on

to facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require Grantee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the
foregoing.
 
25.                                                                               Waiver.  Grantee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by Grantee or any other grantee of an equity award from the

Grant Notice.
 
(b)                           Exercisable Only by the Holder.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or Section 11 hereof, the Stock Option may be
exercised during the Holder’s lifetime only by the Holder or, in the event of the Holder’s legal incapacity to do so, by the Holder’s guardian or legal
representative acting on behalf of the Holder in a fiduciary capacity under court supervision and/or applicable law.
 
(c)                            Procedure for Exercise.  The Stock Option may be exercised by the Holder as to all or any of the Shares as to which the Stock
Option has vested (i) by following the procedures for exercise established by the Equity Account Administrator and posted on the Equity Account
Administrator’s website from time to time or (ii) with the Company’s consent, by giving the Company written notice of exercise, in such form as may be

Exercise Price of the Shares being purchased.  The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to make such payment, which may

same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the
Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to
sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such exercise and to thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an
amount in cash equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Shares being purchased, (iii) by tendering previously owned shares (valued at their Market Value
per Share as of the date of tender), (iv) through the withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise, or (v) any combination of (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv) above or any other manner permitted pursuant to the Plan.
 
A-5
 
(e)                            No Fractional Shares.  In no event may the Stock Option be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
(f)                             No Adjustment for Dividends or Other Rights.  No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record
date is prior to the date as of which the issuance or transfer of Shares to the person entitled thereto has been evidenced on the books and records of the
Company pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 3(g) hereof following exercise of the Stock Option.
 
(g)                            Issuance and Delivery of Shares.  As soon as practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) after the valid exercise of the Stock
Option, the Company shall (i) effect the issuance or transfer of the Shares purchased upon such exercise, (ii) cause the issuance or transfer of such Shares to
be evidenced on the books and records of the Company, and (iii) cause such Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of
the person entitled to such Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided, however,
that, in the event such Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 15 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate evidencing such Shares
and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
(h)                           Partial Exercise.  If the Stock Option shall have been exercised with respect to less than all of the Shares purchasable upon exercise
of the Stock Option, the Company shall make a notation in its books and records to reflect the partial exercise of the Stock Option and the number of Shares
that thereafter remain available for purchase upon exercise of the Stock Option.
 
4.                                      Termination of Employment.  In the event that the Holder’s employment is terminated for any reason, the terms of the Employment
Agreement shall govern the impact on the Stock Option.
 
5.                                      Tax Withholding.
 
(a)                                 Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any Withholding Taxes related to the Holder’s
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Holder, the Holder acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Withholding Taxes is and remains the
Holder’s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Holder further acknowledges that the Company
and/or the Employer (A) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Withholding Taxes in connection with any aspect of the
Stock Option, including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Stock Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such
exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Stock
Option to reduce or eliminate the Holder’s liability for Withholding Taxes or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Holder is subject to tax in more
than one jurisdiction, the Holder acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or
account for Withholding Taxes in more than one jurisdiction.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option
unless and until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 have been satisfied.
 
(b)                                 The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the
exercise (in whole or in part) of the Stock
 
A-6
 
Option, the issuance or transfer of any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option or otherwise in connection with the Award at the time such Withholding
Taxes become due, which may include any of the following:  (i) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds; (ii) if securities of the Company of the same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national securities exchange, the
Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of
irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent, such other
brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such exercise and to
thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of such Withholding Taxes;
(iii) through the withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise; or (iv) by any combination of (i), (ii) or (iii) above.  Further, any entity in the
Company Group shall have the right to require the Holder to satisfy any Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 by any of the aforementioned
methods or by withholding from the Holder’s wages or other cash compensation.
 
(c)                                  The Company Group may withhold or account for Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 by reference to applicable
withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable statutory rates, and if the Company Group withholds more than the amount necessary to
satisfy the liability, the Holder will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent Shares.  If the
obligation for Withholding Taxes is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes the Holder will be deemed to have been issued the full number of
Shares, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Withholding Taxes due as a result of any aspect of the
Holder’s participation in the Plan.  No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Option and the issuance of
Withholding Taxes thereunder.
 
6.                                      Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, the Holder is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan,
the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
7.                                      Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon exercise of the Stock Option such number of
Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon exercise thereof.
 
8.                                      Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of the Holder taken as a whole without the Holder’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may
amend the terms of the Award (i) in
 
A-7
 
recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 9 hereof) affecting any entity in the Company Group
or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in
response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to prevent the Award from becoming subject to
Section 409A.
 
9.                                      Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 13 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Holder that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
10.                               Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Stock Option may not be exercised, and the Stock
Option and Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Stock Option may not be purchased, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The Company is under no
obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, the Stock Option or Shares with the SEC, any state securities
commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such compliance.  The Holder shall make such
representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the Stock Option or Shares, to issue or transfer the Stock Option or Shares in compliance with the
provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to register the issuance or resale of the Stock Option or Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities
law.
 
11.                               Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and only with the Company’s consent, the Holder may transfer all or part of the Stock
Option for estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that any transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in
connection with such transfer; and provided further that the Holder will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these
Award Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 11, the Stock Option shall not be transferable by the Holder other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution.
 
12.                               Employment Violation.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the termination and
cancellation of the Stock Option, whether
 
A-8
 
vested or unvested, and (b) payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to such Employment Violation; provided, however,
that, in lieu of payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount, the Holder, in his or her discretion, may tender to the Company the Shares
acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option during the Look-back Period with respect to such Employment Violation (without any consideration from the
Company in exchange therefor).  Any such termination of the Stock Option and payment of the Recapture Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy available to the Company arising out of or in connection with such Employment Violation, including, without
limitation, the right to terminate the Holder’s employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive relief and additional monetary damages.
 
13.                               Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)                                 The Holder is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to the Holder in connection
with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)                                 The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by the Holder in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
(c)                                  The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines and the limitations contained
therein on the ability of the Holder to transfer any Shares acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option.
 
14.                               Section 409A.  As the Exercise Price is equal to the fair market value of a Share on the Date of Grant, payments contemplated with respect
to the Award are intended to be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and
interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (b) if any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the
imposition on the Holder or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of
the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of the Holder, in the manner that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith
determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties; provided, however, that this Section 13 does not create an
obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or
gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by the Holder pursuant to Section 409A.
 
A-9
 
15.                               Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Shares to
bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’),
OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
16.                               No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be construed to confer upon the
Holder any right to be continued in the employ of any entity in the Company Group or derogate from any right of any entity in the Company Group to retire,
request the resignation of, or discharge the Holder at any time, with or without Cause.
 
17.                               No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of the Stock Option shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any right
of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable against
the Company except to the extent set forth, in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
18.                               Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
19.                               Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)                           For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Stock Option or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation

Exhibit 10.28
 
October 3, 2018
 
Dear Mike,
 
Please find below the terms and conditions of your continued employment with Activision Blizzard, Inc. (the “Company”) (together with its subsidiaries, the
“Company Group”).
 
You will continue to be an at-will employee of the Company, meaning that either the Company or you may terminate your employment with the Company
with cause upon immediate notice or without cause upon ninety (90) days prior notice. The Company will determine all of its internal and external
communications regarding your separation from the Company and the corresponding leadership transition, after meaningful consultation with you in a
manner consistent with the Company’s customary processes for clearing and disseminating important communications. Without limiting either of our
respective rights to terminate your at will employment at any time for any reason, both the Company and you have a present intention to continue your
employment through the end of March, 2019. If prior to the end of March, 2019, either of us decides to terminate your employment, both of us agree to
engage in a meaningful consultation prior to any final determination being made.
 
Effective October 17, 2018, you will serve as, and have the title of, Advisor, reporting to the Chief Operating Officer of the Company. You will no longer be
required to fulfill the responsibilities nor have the title of Chief Executive Officer or any title other than Advisor. Consistent with your change in
responsibilities, you will resign from any office or directorship you have with any member of the Company Group.
 
In your new role as Advisor, your responsibilities will include providing strategic advice and counsel to senior executives of Company Group. You will not be
required to keep regular office or work hours, but will make reasonable efforts to be available to such executives, usually with advance notice.
 
In consideration of your fulfilling your responsibilities as Advisor, and subject to your being employed in good standing by the Company, your already
granted equity (as set forth on Schedule1) will continue to be eligible for vesting according to the terms and conditions of the award agreements and other
governing documents for such equity. If you are no longer employed by the Company, then your unvested equity will be canceled and your vested equity will
be handled consistent with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreements and other governing documents.
 
During the term of your employment through December 31, 2018, you will receive your current base salary. If your employment continues thereafter, you
will receive a base salary of $2,500 per month. In each case, your base salary will be subject to taxes and withholding. Moreover, if you continue to be an
employee in good standing through December 31, 2018, and are otherwise not in breach of this letter agreement, then you will receive a bonus payment with
respect to your service during 2018 in an aggregate amount not less than 3.5% of the Blizzard Profit Sharing
 
 
Plan and a CAIP bonus payment in an amount calculated in the same way as similarly situated executives (subject to the applicable metrics/goals for such
payment being satisfied); any such bonus amounts shall be paid not later than the date on which such bonuses are paid to other executives, whether or not you
are employed by the Company on the date of such payment.
 
As an employee, you will continue to have a duty of loyalty and fiduciary duties to the Company Group. You will continue to be bound and abide by the
Company’s Code of Conduct and the policies of the Company Group, including, without limitation, those related to conflicts of interest. Accordingly, without
the Company’s prior written consent, which may be exercised in its sole discretion, while you are employed by the Company, you may not be employed by or
in any way provide services to any third parties or engage in any competitive or for-profit activities of any kind for your own benefit or for the benefit of any
third party, other than customary investments of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding equity of any publicly traded company.
 
During your employment, you will not, at any time or for any reason, either alone or jointly, with or on behalf of others, whether as principal, partner, agent,
representative, equity holder, director, employee, consultant or otherwise, directly or indirectly: (a) offer employment to, or solicit the employment or
engagement of, or otherwise entice away from the employment or engagement of the Company Group, either for your own account or for any other person,
firm or company, any person employed or otherwise engaged by any entity in the Company Group, whether or not such person would commit any breach of a
contract by reason of his or her leaving the service of the Company Group; or (b) solicit, induce or entice any client, customer, contractor, licensor, agent,
supplier, partner or other business relationship of any entity in the Company Group to terminate, discontinue, renegotiate or otherwise cease or modify its
relationship with the Company Group.
 
For the period following the termination of your employment for any reason whatsoever, through June 30, 2019, you will not, at any time or for any reason,
either alone or jointly, with or on behalf of others, whether as principal, partner, agent, representative, equity holder, director, employee, consultant or
otherwise, directly or indirectly solicit the employment or engagement of, either for your own account or for any other person, firm or company, any fulltime
employee of any entity in the Company Group, whether or not such person would commit any breach of a contract by reason of his or her leaving the service
of the Company Group, provided that this provision shall not be interpreted to prevent the hiring, on behalf of your own account or any other person, firm or
company, any of such persons so long as you have not violated the terms and conditions of this letter agreement.
 
During your employment and at all times following the termination of your employment for any reason whatsoever, you will not, at any time or for any
reason, use the confidential, trade secret information of the Company Group or any other unlawful means to directly or indirectly solicit, induce or entice any
client, customer, contractor, licensor, agent, supplier, partner or other business relationship of any entity in the Company Group to terminate, discontinue,
renegotiate or otherwise cease or modify its relationship with the Company Group.

You expressly acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this letter are reasonably tailored to protect the Company Group’s confidential
information and trade secrets and to ensure that you do not violate your duty of loyalty or any other fiduciary duty to the Company Group, and are reasonable
in all circumstances in scope, duration and all other respects.
 
During your employment and through December 31, 2019, you agree not to criticize, denigrate or otherwise disparage the Company, all current and former
parents, subsidiaries, related companies, partnerships, joint ventures, or other affiliates, and, with respect to each of them, their predecessors and successors;
and, with respect to each such entity, all employees (past and present), all of its past, present, and future officers, directors, and owners, (together, all of the
foregoing shall be referenced as the “Non-Disparaged Parties”), or any of the Non-Disparaged Party’s products, processes, experiments, policies, practices,
standards of business conduct, or areas or techniques of research. However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit you from (a) complying with any lawful
subpoena or court order or taking any other actions affirmatively authorized by law or making a truthful representation in connection with a report or
complaint to an administrative agency; (b) engaging in private discussions with family and friends or (c) responding truthfully and proportionately to any
critical, denigrating or disparaging statements about you by any officer or authorized spokesperson of any entity within the Company Group.
 
Nothing in this letter agreement will alter or amend any obligations either the Company or you may have to the other pursuant to your now expired 2007
employment agreement, as amended (the “Expired Employment Agreement”), specifically including, without limitation, the Company’s obligations to you in
Section 14 and your obligations to the Company in Section 5(b) which remain in full force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-solicit and non-
disparagement provisions hereof supersede any such provisions in the Expired Employment Agreement.
 
Any legal action by the Company for violation of your non-solicit or non-disparagement provisions in this letter agreement must be initiated by the Company
within one year after the expiration of such applicable provision (i.e. prior to July 1, 2020, in the case of the non-solicit provision and prior to January 1,
2021, in the case of the non-disparagement provision).
 
The Company confirms that this letter agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. Each of the
Company and you confirm that this letter agreement is legally valid, binding and enforceable. This letter agreement and the terms and conditions of your at-
will employment will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.
