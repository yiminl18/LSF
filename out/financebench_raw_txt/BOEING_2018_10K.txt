Item 1. Business
The
 Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), is one of the world’s majoraerospace firms.
We are organized based on the products and services w
e offer. We operate in four reportable segments:•
Commercial Airplanes (BCA);•
Defense, Space & Security ( BDS ); •
Global Services ( BGS ); •
Boeing Capital ( BCC ). Commercial Airplanes Segment
This
 segment  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  and  provides  fleet  support  services,  principally  to  the  commercial  airlineindustry
 worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrumof
 global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model andthe 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-bo
dy models. Development continues on certain 737 MAX derivatives and the 777X program.Defense, Space & Security Segment
This
 segment  is  engaged  in  the  research,  development,  production  and  modification  of  manned  and  unmanned  military  aircraft  and  weaponssystems for st
rike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift, including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; and commercialderivative
 aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft. In addition, this segment is engaged in the research, development, production andmodification
 of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  including  strategic  missile  and  defensesystems,
 command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and information solutions,and intelligence systems; satellite systems, includi
ng government and commercial satellites and space exploration.BDS'
 primary customer is the United  States Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ).  Revenues from the U.S. DoD, including foreign military salesthrough
 the  U.S.  government,  accounted  for  approximately 86% of  its 2018 revenues.  Other  significant BDS customers  include  the  NationalAeronautics and Space Administratio
n (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.This segment's primary products
 include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 Strike Eagle, P-8 programs, KC-46ATanker, and
 T-X Trainer. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, and V-22 Osprey. Inaddition,
 this  segment's  products  include  space  and  missile  systems  including:  government  and  commercial  satellites,  the  International  SpaceStation,
 Commercial Crew, missile defense and weapons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance jointventure.
Global Services 
Segment This
 segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a fullspectrum
 of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades andconversions, spare
1

Table of Contentsparts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technic
al and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital services.Boeing Capital 
Segment BCC
 seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overallfinancing exposure. 
BCC ’s  portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for saleor re-lease and investments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have
 licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In additionto
 owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. governmenthas
 licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventionscovered
 by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, tradesecrets,
 and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  theaggregate
 are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  theexpiration of any particular intellectual pro
perty right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.Employees
Total workforce

The
 commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  areintent
 on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  are  focused  on  improving  ourprocesses
 and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers withgreater value products.
BDS
 faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  RaytheonCompany,
 General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategicpresence in the U.S.

Table of Contentsmarket
 by  strengthening  their  North  American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  haveoccasionally
 formed  teams  with  other  competitors  to  address  specific  customer  requirements.  BDS  expects  the  trend  of  strong  competition  tocontinue into 
2019 . The
 commercial  and  defense  services  market  is  an  extremely  challenging  landscape  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.competitors
 facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering productsand
 services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance andengineering,
 modifications  and  upgrades  -  as  well  as  the  daily  cycle  of  gate-to-gate  operations.  BGS  expects  the  market  to  remain  highlycompetitive in 
2019 , and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high lev el of customer satisfaction and productivity.Regulatory Matters
Our
 businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but notlimited
 to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.
Government
Contracts.
The U.S.  government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as wellas
 for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated forconvenience,
 we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of ourgovernment
 contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted andcould require us to pay the difference between the orig
inal contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted fromthe original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us li
able for damages resulting from the default.Commercial

Aircraft.
In  the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and qualitysystems,
 airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements existfor
 airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of eachcountry and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the Europe
an Joint Aviation Authorities.Environmental.
We  are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including thedischarge,
 treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status andmanagement
 of  environmental  matters  to  ensure  our  operations  are  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.Investigation,
 remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal,recurring
 part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible thatcosts
 incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cashflows
 if  additional  work  requirements  or  more  stringent  clean-up  standards  are  imposed  by  regulators,  new  areas  of  soil,  air  and  groundwatercontamination are discovered and/or expa
nsions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.A Potentially Responsibl
e Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRPby
 the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full costof
 remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site forwhich we were originally assi
gned a partial share, the statutory3

Table of Contentsframework
 would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, seeNote 
14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-U.S.

Sales.
Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,including
 regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S.sales are also subject to varying currency, political an
d economic risks.Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies
We
 are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  mostimportant
 raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgingsand
 extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification ofthe sources could take a year or
 more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basiswith a number of companies.
Suppliers
We
 are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, qualitystandards
 and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system tocontrol
 risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affectproduction
 schedules  and  program/contract  profitability,  thereby  jeopardizing  our  ability  to  fulfill  commitments  to  our  customers.  We  are  alsodependent on the availab
ility of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.Seasonality
No material portion of our business is considered to be se
asonal.Executive Officers of the Registrant

Item 1A. Risk Factors
An
 investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materiallyfrom
 our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the informationcontained in this report.
Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.
Market

conditions 
have 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
demand 
for 
our 
commercial 
aircraft 
and 
related 
services.
The  commercial  aircraft  market  ispredominantly
 driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  aresustained
 economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influencedby
 airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price andother
 competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical andvery
 competitive  and  has  experienced  significant  profit  swings  and  constant  challenges  to  be  more  cost  competitive.  In  addition,  availability  offinancing
 to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration inthe
 global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewernew
 orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which couldresult in
 lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlogconsists
 of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these  macroeconomic,  industry  or  customer  impacts  couldunexpectedly affect deliveries over a long p
eriod.We

Commercial aircraft  sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraftare
 delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of afixed
 amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based oncurrent expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escal
ation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can5

Table of Contentsfluctuate
 significantly  from  period  to  period.  Changes  in  escalation  amounts  can  significantly  impact  revenues  and  operating  margins  in  ourCommercial Airplanes business.
We

derive
a
significant
portion
of
our
revenues
from
a
limited
number
of
commercial
airlines.
We  can make no assurance that any customer willexercise
 purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,airline
 consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues andlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our
 Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production ratetargets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The
 commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled
 labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. Inaddition,
 the  introduction  of  new  aircraft  programs  and/or  derivatives,  such  as  the  777X,  involves  increased  risks  associated  with  meetingdevelopment,
 testing,  production  and  certification  schedules.  As  a  result,  our  ability  to  deliver  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  regulatory  and  customerrequirements, and achieve or maintain, as applic
able, program profitability is subject to significant risks.We

must
minimize
disruption
caused
by
production
changes
and
achieve
productivity
improvements
in
order
to
meet
customer
demand
andmaintain
our
profitability.
We  have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engagingin
 significant ongoing development and production of the 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of buildingour
 aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizinghow
 we  manage  inventory.  If  production  rate  changes  at  any  of  our  commercial  aircraft  assembly  facilities  are  delayed  or  create  significantdisruption
 to  our  production  system,  or  if  our  suppliers  cannot  timely  deliver  components  to  us  at  the  cost  and  rates  necessary  to  achieve  ourtargets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the fina
ncial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.Operational

aircraft,
either
of
which
would
negatively
impact
our
revenues
and
operating
margins.
Our commercial
 aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meetinternal
 performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work andincreased
 production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet supportcosts.
If
our

commercial
airplanes
fail
to
satisfy
performance
and
reliability
requirements,
we
could
face
additional
costs
and/or
lower
revenues.
Developing and
 manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatoryagencies, can be costly and technolo
gically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of anyBoeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in d
isruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.Changes
 in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial positionand results of operations.
We
 derive  a  substantial  portion  of  our  revenue  from  the  U.S.  government,  primarily  from  defense  related  programs  with  the  United  StatesDepartment of Defense ( 
U.S. DoD ). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numero us factors such asthe political environment, U.S.

 policy,  macroeconomic  conditions  and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  government  to  enact  relevant  legislation  such  as  authorization  andappropriations bills.
The
 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised preexisting spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spendingbills
 signed  into  law  in  September  2018  provide  defense  funding  for  FY19.  However,  other  departments  and  agencies,  including  the  NationalAeronautics
 and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are being temporarily funded at FY18 levels. Failureto
 enact  a  Continuing  Resolution  or  FY19  appropriations  by  February  15,  2019  would  result  in  a  partial  government  shutdown  affecting  thesedepartments
 and  agencies.  Such  a  shutdown  could  impact  the  Company’s  operations.  In  addition,  reduced  discretionary  spending  limits  initiallyenacted
 in 2011 would take effect again in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21) unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or torepeal
 or suspend the law establishing the reduced limits. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remainand it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spendin
g levels will continue to be subject to pressure.In
 addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S.  DoD and  other governmentagencies
 (including  NASA)  within  the  overall  budgetary  framework  described  above.  While  the  House  and  Senate  Appropriations  Committeesincluded
 funding  for  Boeing’s  major  programs,  such  as  F/A-18  Super  Hornet,  CH-47  Chinook,  AH-64  Apache,  V-22  Osprey,  KC-46A  PegasusTanker and P-8 Poseidon, in their final FY1
9 defense appropriations, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY20 and beyond will affectBoeing’s
 programs.  Future  budget  cuts  or  investment  priority  changes,  including  changes  associated  with  the  authorizations  and  appropriationsprocess
 could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effecton the results of the Company’s operations, financial p
osition and/or cash flows.In
 addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  levels  and  the  nature  of  the  threatenvironment,
 we expect the U.S.  DoD to  continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we canno
 longer  adjust  successfully  to  these  changing  acquisition  priorities  and/or  fail  to  meet  affordability  targets  set  by  the U.S.  DoD customer,  ourrevenues and market share would be further impacted.
We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to un
ique risks.In 
2018 , 31% of  our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales (FMS) through the U.S.government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subj
ect to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.Our

 regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  theoperating
 margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject toadditional
 costs  in  the  form  of  withheld  payments  and/or  reduced  future  business  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  these  requirements  in  the  future.Compliance
 costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial conditionand operating results.

Table of Contentsreasons.
 Further  uncertainty  with  respect  to  ongoing  programs  could  also  result  in  the  event  that  the  U.S.  government  finances  its  operationsthrough
 temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reductionof
 expected  funding and/or modification,  curtailment,  or termination  of one or more  large programs  could have a material adverse  effect  on ourearnings, cash flow and/or financial pos
ition.We

contracts.
U.S.  government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,routinely
 audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicablelaws,
 regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found tobe
 misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must berefunded.
 Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.Furthermore,
 if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  andadministrative
 sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment fromdoing
 business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if suchallegations are later determined to be false.
We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65% and 77% of their 2018 revenues  from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-pricecontracts
 enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced marginsor
 incurring  losses if we are  unable to achieve estimated  costs  and revenues.  If  our estimated  costs  exceed our estimated  price,  we recognizereach-forward
 losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling $736 million 
on  the USAF  KC-46A  Tanker contract  primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costs  associated  with  certification,  testing  and  changeincorporation
 on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. Inaddition,
 in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 million associated with optionsfor
 346 T-X Trainer aircraft and a loss of $291 million related to the MQ-25 Stingray Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract.The
 long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price
 contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts onmargins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedu
le and performance.Fixed-price
 development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  developmentprograms
 have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays andhigher
 costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDSfixed-price
 development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A  Tanker ,  T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25Stingray, and commercial and military satellites.
We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.
Our
 BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35% and 23% of  their 2018 revenues  from cost-type contracting arrangements.Some
 of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award orincentiv
e fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily inreduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical
8

Table of Contentsperformance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include 
GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs. We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to r
isks.Contracts in the
 commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit paymentsmay
 be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment isat
 risk if the satellite does not perform  to specifications  for up to 15 years after acceptance.  The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees weultimately
 expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,customers
 will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incursignificant charges.
Our
 ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financialstability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and o
ther components.We rely on other companies including U.S. and n
on-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated componentsand
 sub-assemblies,  and production commodities  and to perform  some of the services that we provide to our customers.  If one or more  of oursuppliers
 or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meetcommitments
 to our customers or incur additional costs. For example, the 737 program experienced supply chain disruptions in 2018 that impactedthe
 timing of certain deliveries during the year. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium orcomposites)
 becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timelyfashion
 or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers,either
 due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financialdifficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our abil
ity to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.We
 use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financialresults.
Contract and program accounting require judgme
nt relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for scheduleand
 technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion iscomplicated and subject to many variables.
 Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program becausecosts
 also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related toperformance
 on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assessanticipated
 performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees arealso used in sales and profit rates based on actua
l and anticipated awards.With
 respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. Aprogram
 consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort fordelivery
 under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship ofsales to cost of sales, program
9

Table of Contentsaccounting
 requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonablybe
 expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routinewarranty
 costs  for  the  total  program.  Several  factors  determine  accounting  quantity,  including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospectivecustomers
 and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices,costs
 of  derivative  aircraft,  supplier  performance,  customer  and  supplier  negotiations/settlements,  supplier  claims  and/or  certification  issues  canimpact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounti
ng may adversely affect future financial performance.Because
 of the  significance  of  the judgments  and estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and profit  amounts  could berecorded if
 we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances orestimates
 may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales andprofits, see our
 discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting”on pages 
43 – 44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 54 – 66 of this Form 10-K.Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell
 may reduce our future contracts and sales.The
 markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specializedengineering,
 manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasingcompetition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers
 of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industryconsolidation,
 fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S.  DoD and non-U.S. customers
 will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. andnon-U.S.
 competitors  facing  BCA  and  BDS.  Furthermore,  we  are  facing  increased  international  competition  and  cross-border  consolidation  ofcompetition.
 There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  compete  successfully  against  our  current  or  future  competitors  or  that  thecompetitive pressures we face will not result in reduced reven
ues and market share.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countr
ies.In 
2018 ,  non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 56% of  our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continueto
 account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally,including:
•
changes in regulatory requirements; •
U.S.  and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrialcooperation or participation requirements;
•
fluctuations in international currency excha nge rates;•
volatility  in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead todelays or fluctuations in orders;
•
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives a nd consultants;•
the  uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bankof the United States;
•
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the ava ilability of funding credit or guarantees;10

Table of Contents•
imposition of domestic and international taxes, exp ort controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;•
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise sprea d over many countries;•
compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activ ities of U.S. companies abroad; and•
unforeseen developments and con ditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.
Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We
 face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensivenetwork
 of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address thesethreats.
 While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,including
 cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information andinformation
 technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorizedaccess,
 release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged,and/or we could face financial losses.
The
 outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adversedecision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
We
 are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used tobenefit
 our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of theselawsuits,
 or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensiveregulation
 under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  its  various  states,  as  well  as  other  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  As  a  result,  we  aresometimes
 subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S.government,
 the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certainproperty.
 Any  such  inquiry  or  investigation  could  potentially  result  in  an  adverse  ruling  against  us,  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  ourfinancial position and results of operati
ons.A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,which exposes us to concentration risks.
A
 significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio isalso
 concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that webelieve
 have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financialdifficulties
 or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonableterms,
 or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/orfinancial position could b
e materially adversely affected.11

Table of ContentsWe
 may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonableterms or in sufficient amounts.
We
 depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  ourairplane
 financing commitments totaled $19,462  million and $10,221 million .  If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financingcommitments or
 meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increasedborrowing
 costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in theglobal
 capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events mayadversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or fina
ncing commitments.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.
As
 part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. For example, in 2018we
 completed  the  acquisition  of  KLX  Inc.,  a  provider  of  aviation  parts  and  services.  Whether  we  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  from  theseacquisitions
 and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of theunderlying
 product  and  service  portfolio,  and  the  performance  of  the  management  team  and  other  personnel  of  the  acquired  operations.Accordingly,
 our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges,amortization
 of  expenses  related  to  intangibles,  charges  for  impairment  of  long-term  assets,  credit  guarantees,  partner  performance  andindemnifications.
 Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that wehave
 established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will besuccessful.
 We  also  may  make  strategic  divestitures  from  time  to  time.  These  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial  involvement  in  thedivested
 businesses,  such  as through  guarantees  or  other  financial  arrangements,  following  the  transaction.  Nonperformance  by those  divestedbusinesses could affect our future financial results through a
dditional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We
 are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  somecircumstances,
 we  may  receive  indemnification  from  the  U.S.  government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  orliabilities
 and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircrafttechnologies,
 missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable oncommercially
 reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the2002
 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurancecoverage we maintain may be inadeq
uate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.
Our
 business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damagingweather
 or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or ourability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant prod
uction delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper12

Table of Contentsuse
 of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation ofBoeing and of our products and services.
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.
Approximately 
54,000 employees,  which constitute 35% of  our total workforce, were union represented as of December  31, 2018 . We experienced a
 work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional workstoppages
 in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labororganizations
 and 13 non-U.S.  labor  organizations,  will  be  or  whether  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the  unions’  requirements  without  impacting  ourfinancial
 condition.  The  unions  may  also  limit  our  flexibility  in  dealing  with  our  workforce.  Union  actions  at  suppliers  can  also  affect  us.  Workstoppages
 and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationshipswith customers and cause a loss of revenues which wou
ld adversely affect our operations.Substantial
 pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cashflows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatoryamounts
 required under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act and  discretionary contributions to improve the plans '  funded status. Theextent
 of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate futurecontributions
 to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could  have a significant effecton
 future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders '  equity. For U.S. governmentcontracts, we allocate pension costs to individua
l contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. Wealso
 provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  andqualifying
 dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the levelof
 medical  cost  increases.  For  a  discussion  regarding  how  our  financial  statements  can  be  affected  by  pension  and  other  postretirement  planaccounting
 policies, see “  Management '  s Discussion and Analysis -  Critical Accounting Policies -  Pension Plans ”  on page 45 of this Form 10-K.Although
 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) expense and pension or other postretirement benefitcontributions
 are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock wewould contribute to our plans.

Table of ContentsOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We
 are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,treatment,
 storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, finesand
 civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable underenvironmental
 laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or pastmanufacturing
 operations  or  the  operations  of  companies  we  have  acquired.  In  other  cases,  we  may  become  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  anindemnification
 agreement  between  us  and  a  third  party  relating  to  such  environmental  liabilities.  In  addition,  new  laws  and  regulations,  morestringent
 enforcement  of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediationrequirements
 could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.

2018 increased by $7,122 million or 8% compared with 2017 due to higher revenues at  BCA, BDS, and BGS. BCA revenues increased by 
$2,701 million due to higher 737  and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries . BDS 
revenues increased by $2,634 million primarily due to non-US contract award s for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft saleand
 higher satellites revenue .  BGS revenues increased by $2,437 million due  to growth  across our services portfolio, primarily driven by higherparts revenue including the acquis
ition of KLX Inc. (KLX). The increases at BCA, BDS, and BGS were partially offset by lower unall ocated revenue.Revenues
 in 2017 increased by $509 million or 1% compared with 2016. BDS revenues increased by $381 million primarily due  to higher weaponsrevenue.
 BGS revenues increased by $762 million primarily  due to higher commercial parts revenue. The increases at BDS and BGS were partiallyoffset
 by lower BCA revenues, primarily due to delivery  mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisledeliveries 
. The
 changes  in  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other  in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 primarily  reflect  the  timing  of  eliminations  for  intercompanyaircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated underGAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.
**
Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See page 40 .Earnings
 from operations in 2018 increased by $1,643 million compared  with 2017 ,  primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, which morethan
 offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,427million 
in 2018 due  to higher  revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins,improved
 cost performance and favorable delivery mix. BGS  earnings from operations increased by $276 million in 2018 primarily  due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher period costs 
. BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings’ growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions, as well as
$199 million of higher KC-46A Ta
nker reach-forward losses . Earnings
 from operations in 2017 increased by $3,817  million compared  with 2016 due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS, partially offset by thechange
 in  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other.  BCA  earnings  from  operations  increased  by $3,471  million in  2017  primarily  due  to  lowerreach-forward
 losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance. In 2016, BCA recordedreach-forward
 losses of $1,258  million on  the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research anddevelopment. The reclassification of flight test
 aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787flight
 test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. BDS earnings from operations increased by $515  million in  2017 primarily due to lowercharges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew pro
grams.During 
2018, 2017 and 2016 ,  we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2018 , we recorded charges of $736 million , of which 
$500  million was  recorded at BCA, $222  million at BDS ,  and $14  million at  BGS. During 2017 ,  we recorded charges of $445  million : $378million 
at  BCA, $44  million at  BGS, and $23  million at  BDS. During 2016 ,  we recorded charges of $1,127  million : $772 million at  BCA and $351 million 
at BDS. Core
 operating earnings for 2018 increased by $1,754 million compared with 2017 primarily due  to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, partially offsetby lower earnings at BDS and high
er unallocated expenses.20

 compensation expense decreased by $221 million in 2018 and  increased by $194 million in 2017, primarily driven by changes in broadstock market conditions and our stock price.
Eliminations
 and other unallocated expense increased by $537  million in 2018 primarily  due to timing of expense allocations, higher research anddevelopment
 expense  and  a  $148  million  charge  incurred  related  to  the  outcome  of  the  Spirit  litigation.  See  the  discussion  in  Note 13 to  ourConsolidated Financial State

Other  income/(loss), net increased  by $561  million in 2017 primarily  due to a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement costsand
 higher gains from foreign exchange. The non-operating pension expense included in Other  income/(loss), net was  a benefit of $143  million in 2018 
and $117 million in 2017 ,  compared with an expense of $327  million in 2016 .  The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns inexcess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2
016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously capitalizedas inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of exp
ected returns.Interest and
 debt expense increased by $115 million in 2018 as a  result of higher debt balances and lower capitalized interest and increased by $54 million 
in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest. For additional discussion relate
d to Income Taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)
Cost
 of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.Our
 BCA  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  eachcommercial airplan
e program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of salespercentage
 applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.Substantially
 all contracts at our BDS segment,  certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and  certain contracts at our BGS segment  arelong-term
 contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Costs on these contracts are recordedas incurred.

Unobligated
 backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been  authorized.  The increase in unobligated backlog in 
2018 was primarily due to  contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGScontracts.
Additional Considerations
KC-46A
 Tanker In  2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S.  Air Force ( USAF )  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and deliver  four  nextgeneration
 aerial  refueling  tankers.  The KC-46A  Tanker is  a  derivative  of  our  767  commercial  aircraft.  This  Engineering,  Manufacturing  andDevelopment
 (EMD)  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  valued  at  $4.9  billion  and  involves  highly  complex  designs  and  systemsintegration.
 In 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized  two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at$2.8
 billion,  and  in  2017,  the  USAF  authorized  an  additional  LRIP  lot  for  15  aircraft  valued  at  $2.1  billion.  On  September  10,  2018,  the  USAFauthorized an additional L
RIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $2.9 billion. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and23

Table of Contentsfull
 rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value ofapproximately $30 billion. In Janu
ary 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF . During
 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,127  million related  to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2017, we recorded reach-forward
 losses  of $445  million related  to  this  program,  primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costs  associated  with  certification  and  incorporatingchanges
 into  LRIP  aircraft.  During  2018,  we  recorded  additional  reach-forward  losses  of $736  million primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costsassociated with certification, flight testing and chan
ge incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirementsin
 order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward lossesand/or delivery delays if we experience further producti
on, technical or quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification and/or delivery.Export-Import
 Bank  of  the  United  States Many  of  our  non-U.S.  customers  finance  purchases  through  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  the  UnitedStates.
 Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is nowauthorized through September 30, 2019. How
ever, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board ofdirectors,
 the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitmentsand/or
 enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannotobtain
 financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. Wecontinue to work with our
 customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternativethird party financing sources.
Global
 Trade On  June 1, 2018, the U.S. Government began imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, severalmajor U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their inte
ntion to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. We continue to monitor the potential for anyextra costs that may result from these actions.
On
 July  6,  2018,  the  U.S.  and  China  began  imposing  tariffs  on  approximately  $34  billion  of  each  other's  exports.  Certain  aircraft  parts  andcomponent
s that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods,and
 China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of U.S goods. On December 1, 2018, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day timetableto
 negotiate a resolution to the trade dispute. We continue to monitor the potential for any disruption and adverse revenue and/or cost impacts thatmay result from these actions or future geopolitical economic develo
pments.The
 U.S.  Government  continues  to  impose  and/or  threaten  to  impose  sanctions  on  certain  businesses  and  individuals  in  Russia.  Although  ouroperations
 or  sales  in  Russia  have  not  been  impacted  to  date,  we  continue  to  monitor  additional  sanctions  that  may  be  imposed  by  the  U.S.Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, bus
iness partners or customers.24

Commercial Airplanes
Business Environment and Trends
Airline
 Industry Environment Global  economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, was above the long-term average of approximately 3% in2018.
 Passenger traffic  is estimated  to grow by 6.5% in 2018, exceeding the long-term  average of approximately  5%. While growth was strongacross
 all  major  world  regions,  there  continues  to  be  variation  between  regions  and  airline  business  models.  Airlines  operating  in  Asia  Pacific,Europe
 and North America, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth isexpected to be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 201
8, around the long-term average.Airline
 financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances,partnerships,
 new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducingcosts and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airpla
nes. Net profits in 2018 are expected to approximate $32 billion.The
 long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth and theincreasi
ng propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights betweencountries. Our
 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based onlong-term
 global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.3 trillion market for approximately 42,700 newairplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerab
le to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, actsof terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global e
nvironmental regulations.Industry
 Competitiveness The  commercial  jet  airplane  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  Market  liberalization  inEurope,
 the  Middle  East  and  Asia  is  enabling  low-cost  airlines  to  continue  gaining  market  share.  These  airlines  are  increasing  the  pressure  onairfares.
 This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensurea favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.
Continued
 access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately88% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in d
ollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines.We
 face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access tomost
 of  the  same  customers  and  suppliers.  With  government  support,  Airbus  has  historically  invested  heavily  to  create  a  family  of  products  tocompete
 with ours. Regional jet makers, Embraer and Bombardier, continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes.During
 2018,  Airbus  acquired  a  majority  share  of  Bombardier’s  C  Series  (now  A220)  and  is  in  the  100-150  seat  transcontinental  market,  whileEmbraer’s
 first E195-E2 delivered in 2018. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft.Some
 of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reducesthe
 cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercialviability;
 others  to  be  brought  to  market  more  quickly  than  otherwise  possible;  and  many  offered  for  sale  below  market-based  prices.  Manycompetitors
 have  continued  to  make  improvements  in  efficiency,  which  may  result  in  funding  product  development,  gaining  market  share  andimproving
 earnings.  This  market  environment  has  resulted  in  intense  pressures  on  pricing  and  other  competitive  factors,  and  we  expect  thesepressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.

Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses† Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating le
ases in consolidation identified by parenthesesEarnings From Operations
Earnings
 from operations in 2018 increased by $2,427 million compared  with 2017 .  The increase in operating earnings reflects higher  revenuesand
 improved  operating  margins.  The  increase  in  operating  margins  is  primarily  due  to  higher  787  margins,  improved  cost  performance  andfavorable delivery mix.
Earnings
 from operations in 2017 increased by $3,471 million compared  with 2016 .  The increase in operating earnings and operating margins isprimarily
 due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance,which
 more than offset the impact of lower revenues. Research and development expense in 2016 reflects the reclassification from inventory toresearch and development expense of $1,235 million related to the
 fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the777X program.

 losses of $500  million , $378 million and $772 million were  recorded  related  to  the  KC-46A  Tanker  in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During 
2016 , we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 millio n.Backlog
Our
 total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers wherewe
 believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required toperform.
 Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approvalfrom
 its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or haveexpired
 prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A numberof
 our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for othercontractual
 relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and isreported in accordance with the requirements of ASU No. 201
4-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).BCA
 total backlog of $412,307  million at  December 31, 2018 increased from $410,986  million at  December 31, 2017, primarily due to net orders inexcess of deliveries.
Accounting
 Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  andanticipated
 contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenueand cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize o
n sales of individual airplanes throughout aprogram’s
 life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  thatprogram,
 including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective  customers  and  market  studies.  We  review  our  program  accounting  quantitiesquarterly.
The
 accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to beunder
 contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantitymust be considered.

Program Highlights
737 Program 
The  accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2018 due to the program ’  s normal progress of obtainingadditional
 orders and delivering airplanes. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017, announced the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017and
 delivered the first 737 MAX 9 in March 2018. The production rate increased from 47 per month to 52 per month in the second quarter of 2018,however the timing of deliveries in 2018
 was adversely affected by delays in the supply chain. We continue to plan to increase the production rate to57 per month in
 2019.747 Program 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we received a firm order for  4 new aircraft and increased the accounting quantity by 4 units to 1,574aircraft.
 The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2022. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5aircraft
 per month having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million aslower
 than expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower than expected growth of global freight traffic resultedin
 lower  anticipated  revenues  from  future  sales  and  higher  costs  to  produce  fewer  airplanes.  We  continue  to  evaluate  the  viability  of  the  747program.
 We believe that a decision to end production of the 747 at the end of the current accounting quantity would not have a material impact onour financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Table of Contents767
 Program The  accounting  quantity  for  the  767  program  increased  by  24  units  during  the  first  quarter  of  2018  due  to  the  program's  normalprogress of
 obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. Weare currently producing at a rate of 2.5 per month and plan to increase to 3 per month in 2020.
777
 Program The  accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 55 units during 2018 due to the program’s normal progress of obtainingadditional
 orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 5 per month. In 2013, we launched the 777X, which features anew composite wing, new engin
es and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in theyear of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020.
787
 Program The  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 200 units during 2018 due to the program’s normal progress of obtainingadditional
 orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. Wedelivered the first 787-10 in March 2018.
Fleet Support 
We  provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.Collecti
vely known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational lifeof
 the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  andtechnical
 data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately  1.0%  of  totalconsolidated costs of products and services.

Additional Considerations
The
 development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  withsuppliers
 and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well asthose
 of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, suchas
 the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliveraircraft
 on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significantrisks.
 Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses)include the followi
ng: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalationfactors
 due  to  changes  in  the  inflation  rate  or  other  economic  indicators,  performance  or  reliability  issues  involving  completed  aircraft,  capitalexpenditures and other costs associated with incre
asing or adding new29

 capacity,  learning curve, additional change incorporation,  achieving anticipated cost reductions,  flight test and certification  schedules,costs,
 schedule  and  demand  for  new  airplanes  and  derivatives  and  status  of  customer  claims,  supplier  assertions  and  other  contractualnegotiations.
 While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technicalcomplexity
 of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates couldbe extended, which could trigger termination prov
isions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & Security
Business Environment and Trends
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The
 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, raised the 2011 Budget Control Act spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019(FY18
 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19, in compliance with therevised
 caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agenciesnot
 covered  by  enacted  FY19  appropriations,  including  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  Federal  AviationAdministration
 (FAA),  remains  uncertain.  The  unfunded  departments  and  agencies  affected  by  the  partial  government  shutdown  (December  22,2018
 through  January  25,  2019)  are  now  covered  by  a  Continuing  Resolution  that  extends  funding  at  FY18  levels  through  February  15,2019.
 Congress  and  the  President  must  agree  to  FY19  appropriations  or  an  additional  Continuing  Resolution  to  fund  affected  departments  andagencie
s beyond the February 15 deadline in order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdownto the Company’s operations would incre
ase as the shutdown continues. There
 continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, includingNASA.
 The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20and FY21). The
 lower budget caps will take effect again in FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspendthe law. As a
 result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority changescould
 result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on theresults of the Company’s operations, financial pos
ition and/or cash flows. 
Non-U.S. Defense
 Environment Overview The non-U.S.  market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the needto
 modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and theMiddle East given the diverse regiona
l threats. At the end of 2018, 30% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.Results of Operations

earnings  from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared  with 2017 as  earnings’ growth from higher revenues was more thanoffset
 by charges  of  $691 million  related  to winning the  T-X Trainer  and MQ-25  competitions,  as well as $199 million  of  higher KC-46A  Tankerreach-forward
 losses .  Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to earnings for 2018 were $315  million lower than  the comparableperiod in the prior year, driven by higher charges on dev
elopment programs in 2018.31

Table of ContentsBDS 
earnings  from operations in 2017 increased by $515  million compared  with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker andCommercial
 Crew programs.  Higher earnings reflect the favorable impact of cumulative catch-up adjustments which were $374  million higher in 2017 than in 2016, primarily driven by low
er charges on development programs in 2017.BDS
 earnings from operations include equity earnings of $147  million , $183 million and $249 million primarily  from our ULA and non-U.S. jointventures in 
2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During 
2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  BDS  recorded  charges  related  to  the  KC-46A  Tanker  contract  of $222  million , $23  million and $351  million , respectively.
Backlog
Total backlog of 
$57,166 million at December 31, 2018 increase d by 30% from $44,049 million at December 31, 2017 , primarily due to current year contract
 awards in many of our programs greater than revenue recognized. Significant orders included Satellites, F/A-18 fighters, Ground-basedMidcourse Defense, weapons, VC-25B Presi
dential Aircraft, V-22 Osprey, CH-47 Chinook, MQ-25 Stingray and T-X Trainer.Additional Considerations
Our BDS
 business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs havecost-type
 contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  programcancellation
 if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense , Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some
 of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed priced proposals fornew
 programs.  Examples  of  significant  fixed-price  development  programs  include  Commercial  Crew,  Saudi  F-15,  USAF  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-XTrainer,
 VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forwardloss
 upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. In the third quarter, we were awarded contracts to develop the T-X Traineraircraft
 with  complementary  devices  and  the  MQ-25  Stingray.  We  recorded  orders  of  $1,618  million  and  recognized  losses  of  $691  millionassociated
 with  these  contracts.  Many  development  programs  have  highly  complex  designs.  As  technical  or  quality  issues  arise  duringdevelopment,
 we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce ourestimated
 price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing,and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complex
ity of these programscreates
 financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could triggertermination
 provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.

Table of ContentsT-X Trainer 
In  September 2018, we were selected by the U.S. Air Force to build the next generation training capability, known as T-X. The programincludes
 aircraft  and  simulators  as  well  as  support  and  ground  equipment.  The  contract  is  structured  as  an  indefinite  delivery/indefinite  quantity(IDIQ)
 fixed-price contract with a minimum of 206 aircraft and a maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract valued at $813million
 and includes five aircraft and seven simulators, with a period of performance that runs through 2022. The production and support contractsare
 structured as options that begin with authorization from fiscal year 2022 to 2034. In connection with winning this competition, we recorded areach-forward
 loss of $400 million associated with anticipated losses on the options for 346 aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised.We believe that our investment in this contract positions us for additiona
l market opportunities for both trainer and light attack aircraft.MQ-25
 Stingray In  August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 Stingray for the U.S. Navy. The EMD contract is a fixed-price
 contract that includes development and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $805 million. In connection with winningthis
 competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 million. The period of performance runs from 2018 through 2024. The MQ-25 Stingrayis
 the U.S. Navy’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positions us for long-termleadership in autonomy and artificia
l intelligence technologies along with additional market opportunities.Global Services
Business Environment and Trends
The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, lo
gistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; trainingand professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% a
nnually.As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet conti
nues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency andextend
 the  economic  lives  of  airplanes.  Airlines  are  using  data  analytics  to  plan  flight  operations  and  predictive  maintenance  to  improve  theirproductivity and efficiency. Airlines continu
e to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcingspares management to third parties.
Government
 services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S.government services market is the single largest individu
al market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over thenext
 decade,  we  expect  U.S.  growth  to  remain  flat  and  non-U.S.  fleets,  led  by  Middle  East  and  Asia  Pacific  customers,  to  add  rotorcraft  andcommercial derivativ
e aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replacedover the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain agi
ng aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.BGS’
 major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 30 , which could restrict theexecution of certain program activities and delay ne
w programs or competitions.Industry
 Competitiveness Aviation  services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environmenthas resulted
 in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to globalmarkets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential a
nd long-term investment returns.33

Business Environment and Trends
BCC’s
 gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December  31, 2018 totaled $2,792  million .  A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio isrelated to
 customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeingaircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.
BCC
 provided customer financing of $601  million and $480 million during 2018 and 2017 .  While we may be required to fund a number of newaircraft
 deliveries in 2019 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable pricesfrom broad
 and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if theExport-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve ne
w financing transactions.Aircraft
 values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,700 western-builtcommercial jet aircraft (6.7% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 
2018 , including both in-production an d out-of-production aircraft types.Of
 these parked aircraft, approximately 2% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2017 and 2016 , 8.3% and 8.8% of the western-built commercial
 jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively fewoperators, are placed out of service.

 progress billings increase d by $2.6 billion in 2018 , increase d by $4.7 billion in 2017 and decrease d by $1.3 billion in 2016 . During 2017,
 our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included $14.4 million shares of  our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and 
$0.5 billion in cash. Discretionary contributions to our pension p lans were insignificant in 2018 and 2016 . Investing
 Activities Cash  used by investing activities during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $4.6  billion , $2.1 billion and $3.4 billion primarily  due toacquisitions
 during the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of cash acquired were $3.2  billion in 2018 ,  comparedwith 
$0.3  billion in 2017 and 2016 .  Capital expenditures totaled $1.7  billion in  both 2018 and 2017 ,  down from $2.6  billion in 2016 .  We expectcapital
 expenditures in 2019 to be higher than 2018 .  Net proceeds from investments was $0.3  billion in 2018 and  insignificant in 2017 , compared with net contributions to investments of 
$0.5 billion in 2016. Financing Activities 
Cash  used by financing activities was $11.7 billion during 2018 ,  an increase of $0.4 billion compared with 2017 primarily due to higher dividend payments partially offset by hig
her net borrowings. Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017 , an increase of $1.8 billion 
compared with 2016 ,  primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments. Net borrowings were $1.4 billion in 2018 , $1.1billion 
in 2017 and insignificant in 2016 . At 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 the recorded balance of  debt was $13.8 billion and $11.1 billion of which $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion was classified as
 short-term. At December  31, 2018 and 2017 this  included $2.5  billion of  debt attributable to BCC ,  of which $0.5  billion and $0.9 billion were classified as short-term.
During 
2018 and 2017 we  repurchased 26.1  million and 46.1 million shares  totaling $9.0  billion and $9.2 billion through  our open market sharerepurchase
 program. In 2018  and 2017 ,  we had 0.7  million shares  transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December  31, 2018 , the amount available under the share repurch
ase plan, announced on December 17, 2018 , totaled $20 billion . Capital
 Resources We  have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debtcovenants
 as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December  31, 2018 and 2017 
,  commercial paper borrowings totaling $1,895  million and $600 million ,  which were supported by unused commitments under the revolvingcredit
 agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. At December  31, 2018 ,  we had $5.1  billion of  unused borrowing capacity onrevolving
 credit  line  agreements.  We  anticipate  that  these  credit  lines  will  primarily  serve  as  backup  liquidity  to  support  our  general  corporateborrowing needs.
Financing
 commitments  totaled $19.5  billion and $10.2  billion at December  31,  2018  and  2017 .  The  increase  primarily  relates  to  commercialairplane orders received in 2018. We antici
pate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continueto work
 with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts ofoutstanding
 commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. Inaddition,
 many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expirationof
 the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30,2019. However, until the U.S.
 Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be ableto
 approve  any  transaction  totaling  more  than  $10  million.  As  a  result,  we  may  fund  additional  commitments  and/or  enter  into  new  financingarrangements with customers.
In
 the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorableresolution
 of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuingcommercial
 paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term andlong-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequ
ate financial flexibility37

 take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of thecost or availability of future borrowings under our commercial pap
er program or in the debt markets.At 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 ,  our pension plans were $15.3  billion and $16.4 billion underfunded  as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement
 Income Security Act ( ERISA )  basis our plans are 96% funded at December  31, 2018 with  minimal required contributions in 2019 . We do
 not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2019 .  We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in futureyears.
At 
December  31,  2018 ,  we  were  in  compliance  with  the  covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  alimitation
 on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leaseback  transactions  as  a  percentage  of  consolidated  net  tangible  assets  (as  defined  in  the  creditagreements),
 and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue tohave substantial bor

 relates  to  inventory  procurement  contracts.  We  have  entered  into  certain  significant  inventory  procurement  contracts  that  specifydeterminable
 prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. Theseagreements require suppliers and vend
ors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need forsuch
 arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portionof
 these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customersfor
 penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for programand
 contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included ourbest estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the tabl

Industrial Participation Agreements 
We have entered into  various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. tofacilitate
 economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement ofgoods
 and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders forsupplies,
 opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitmentsmay
 be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties couldbe
 imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2018 ,  we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2018 , we have
 outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4  billion that  extend through 2030 .  Purchase order commitments associated withindustrial
 participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitmentfrom us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, qual
ity and schedule.39

) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP fina ncial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as asubstitute
 for  the  related  GAAP  measures,  and  other  companies  may  define  such  measures  differently.  We  encourage  investors  to  review  ourfinancial
 statements  and  publicly-filed  reports  in  their  entirety  and  not  to  rely  on  any  single  financial  measure.  Core  operating  earnings,  coreoperatin
g margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents thedifference
 between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Coreearnings
 per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operatingpension
 and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprisingservice and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are a

 BCA  and  certain  BGS  businesses  supporting  commercial  customers.  Pension  costs  allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supportinggovernment
 customers  are  computed  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Government  Cost  Accounting  Standards  (CAS),  which  employ  different  actuarialassumptions
 and  accounting  conventions  than  GAAP.  CAS  costs  are  allocable  to  government  contracts.  Other  postretirement  benefit  costs  areallocated to all business segments bas
ed on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.The Pension
 FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings during 2018 was a benefit of $1,005 million ,  largely consistent with a benefitof 
$1,127 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016 . The non-operating  pension expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million 
in 2018 and $117 million in 2017 , compared with an expense of $327 million in 2016 . The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns in
 excess  of  interest  cost  and  amortization  of  actuarial  losses.  The  expense  in  2016  reflects  the  amortization  of  non-service  costs  previouslycapitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuari
al losses in excess of expected returns.For
 further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 21 of this Form 10-K andsee
 Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings pershare
 for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provideinvestors
 additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent costsdriven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Critical Accounting Policies
Accounting for long-term contracts
Substantially
 all contracts at BDS, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Ourlong-term
 contracts  typically  represent  a  single  distinct  performance  obligation  due  to  the  highly  interdependent  and  interrelated  nature  of  theunderlying goods and/or services an
d the significant service of integration that we provide.Accounting
 for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation.Cost
 of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reportedas cost of sales.
Due
 to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicatedand subject
 to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regardingcontract
 options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  asinflation
 or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based onestimated
 cost  to  produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  bereimbursed
 in  establishing  contract  price.  Total  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historicalperformance trends,
 business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical andschedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, busin
ess volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and
 cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in theseestimates
 could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of salesand
 profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or anadjustment
 to  a  reach-forward  loss,  which  would  be  recorded  immediately  in  earnings.  For  the  years  ended  December  31, 2018 and 2016 net unfavorab
le cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by$190
 million and $263 million .  For the year ended December 31, 2017 ,  net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forwardlosses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings from operations by 
$250 million . Due
 to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if weused different
 assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance,or circumstances
43

Table of Contentsmay
 adversely  or  positively  affect  financial  performance  in  future  periods.  If  the  combined  gross  margin  for  all  long-term  contract  performanceobligations
 for all of 2018 had  been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year byapproximately 
$297  million .  In  addition,  a  number  of  our  fixed  price  development  contracts  are  in  a  reach-forward  loss  position.  Changes  toestimated losses are recorded immediately in earnin
gs.Program Accounting
Program
 accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  the  relationship  of  sales  to  costs  for  the  defined  program  accountingquantity.
 A  program  consists  of  the  estimated  number  of  units  (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-termproduction
 effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to makereasonably
 dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost ofsales
 is  determined  by  applying  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  for  the  total  remaining  program  to  the  amount  of  sales  recognized  forairplanes delivered and acc
epted by the customer.Factors
 that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured partcosts,
 major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accountingquantity for
 each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, lettersof
 intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and salesprice for all unsold units within 
the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales pricesfor
 all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates arebased
 largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economicprojections.
 Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/orsupplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticip
ated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To
 ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Changes  inestimates
 are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues fromundelivered
 units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in theaccounting quantity. For example, in 2016, we recorde
d a reach-forward loss of $1,258 million on the 747 program.The
 program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program.Because of the higher unit production costs experi
enced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling andother
 non-recurring  costs,  new  commercial  aircraft  programs,  such  as  the  787  and  777X  programs,  typically  have  lower  initial  margins  thanestablished
 programs.  In  addition,  actual  costs  incurred  for  earlier  units  in  excess  of  the  estimated  average  cost  of  all  units  in  the  programaccounting
 quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quant
ity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveriesis below the estimated average cost as learning curve a
nd other improvements are realized.Due to the significance of
 judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances orassumptions
 could  have  a  material  effect  on  program  gross  margins.  If  the  combined  gross  margin  percentages  for  our  commercial  airplaneprograms had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it woul

 margins. For the year ended December  31, 2018 ,  a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segmentwould have a 
$607 million impact on operating earnings. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible 
ImpairmentsWe
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. Ifwe
 determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-stepimpairment
 process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, wefirst
 compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, asecond
 step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fairvalue
 of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwillimpairment.
We
 estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate offuture
 sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements andgeneral market conditions. Changes in thes
e forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The
 cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at thedate of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
We completed our assessment of goodwill as of
 April 1, 2018 and determined that  there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2018 , we estimated that the fair value of
 each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases inthe
 value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairmentcharges in future periods.
As
 of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  we had $490  million of  indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and tradenames
 acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  by  comparing  their  carrying  value  to  current  projections  ofdiscounted
 cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows representsthe
 amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangibleassets.
Pension Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees
 transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans effective  January  1,  2019.  Accounting  rules  require  anannual measurement of
 our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discountrate
 and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes cansignificantly affect our future annual expense, projecte
d benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.45

 cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expectedlong-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 
2018 net periodic pension cost by $154 million . Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We
 have  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk,  principally  fixed-rate  debt  obligations,  and  customer  financing  assets  andliabilities. Additiona
lly, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we havenot
 experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December  31, 2018 , the
 impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in ourfixed-rate
 debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interestrate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We
 are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We useforeign
 currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  andreceipts
 related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  AtDecember
 31,  2018 ,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  ordecreased
 our unrealized losses by $262 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,such unrealized losses
 or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactionsbeing hedge
d. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.46

Note 
1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,”
 “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entitiesthat
 are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.  As  described  in  Note 23 ,effective
 July  1,  2017,  we  now  operate  in four reportable  segments:  Commercial  Airplanes  (BCA);  Defense,  Space  &  Security  (BDS),  GlobalServices (BGS), and Boeing Capital (BCC). Amounts in prior peri
ods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements  in conformity  with U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles  (GAAP) requires  management to makeestimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe
 financial statements  and the reported amounts  of revenues  and expenses during the reporting  period. Actual results  could differ  from thoseestimates.
Operating Cycle
For
 classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which isgenerally longer than one year 
. Standards Issued and Implemented
In
 the  first  quarter  of  2018,  we  adopted  the  following  Accounting  Standards  Updates  (ASUs): ASU  2014-09 , Revenue

(Topic

,  using  the  fullretrospective
 method. Topic 606 requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts thatreflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitl
ed in exchange for those goods or services.Most
 of our defense contracts at our BDS and BGS segments and certain military derivative aircraft contracts at our BCA segment now recognizerevenue
 under  the  new  standard  as  costs  are  incurred.  Under  previous  GAAP,  revenue  was  generally  recognized  when  deliveries  were  made,performance
 milestones were attained, or as costs were incurred. The new standard accelerates the timing of when the revenue is recognized,however,
 it does not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contracts. The new standard does not affect revenue recognition orthe use of program accounting for commercial airplane contracts in our BCA bus
iness. We continue to recognize revenue for these contracts54

 the point in time when the customer  accepts delivery of the airplane. The adoption resulted in a cumulative adjustment to increase Retainedearnings
 by $901 at  January 1, 2016, an increase of $139 to  Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, and an increase of $261 to Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017.

. The standard requires non-service cost components of net periodicbenefit
 cost to be presented in non-operating earnings using a retrospective transition method. We applied a practical expedient as the estimationbasis
 for  the  reclassification  of  prior  period  non-service  cost  components  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  from  Earnings  from  operations  to  Otherincome/(loss),
 net. Through the end of 2017, a portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense was not recognized innet
 earnings in the year incurred because it was allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of the reportingperiods.
 Effective January 1, 2018, in accordance with our adoption of ASU 2017-07, only service costs may be allocated to production costs andcapitalized in inventory on a prospectiv
e basis. The impact of adoption was not material.ASU 2016-18

 rate enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017. This resulted in an increase of $2,997 to  Retained earnings and anincrease of 
$2,997 to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenue and Related Cost Recognition
Commercial
 aircraft contracts The  majority of our BCA segment  revenue is derived from commercial aircraft  contracts. For each contract, wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraftperformance
 obligation  based  on  relative  standalone  selling  prices  adjusted  by  an  escalation  formula  as  specified  in  the  customer  agreement.Revenue
 is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by thecustomer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.
Where an aircraft is
 still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer (known as a bill-and-hold arrangement), revenue willbe recognized when all spec
ific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includ
es a deposit upon order andadditional
 payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances andprogress
 billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and  customary  for  commercial  aircraft  contracts  and  not  considered  a  significant  financingcomponent as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately compl
ete some or all of its obligations under the contract.Long-term contracts 
Substantially  all contracts at BDS ,  certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at BGS are long- term
 contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contractsprimarily include fighter
55

Table of Contentsjets,
 rotorcraft, cybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons, missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems, andmodification
 of  commercial  passenger  aircraft  to  cargo  freighters.  Services  sales  under  long-term  contracts  primarily  include  support  andmaintenance agreements associated with o
ur commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.For
 each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transactionprice
 to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standaloneselling
 prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelatednature
 of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-term
 contracts  may  be  modified  over  their  life,  the  transaction  price  is  based  on  current  rights  and  obligations  under  the  contract  and  does  notinclude
 potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition forthe
 additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costsincurred
 plus  an  agreed  upon  profit.  The  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  inestablishing
 the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration,such
 as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value,based on a weighted probab
ility, or the most likely amount.Long-term contract revenue is
 recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as servicesare
 rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to thecustomer.
 For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow thecustomer
 to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work inprocess.
 Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as  evidenced  either  by  contractualtermination
 clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do nothave an alternative use to the Company.
The
 accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales ,  costs and profit for each performance obligation.Cost of
 sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit tothe
 amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales. Recognizing  revenue  as  costs  are  incurred  provides  an  objective  measure  of  progress  on  the  long-termcontract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.
Changes
 in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustmentwhich recognizes in the current period the cumulativ
e effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion.
 When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forwardloss on the long-term contract is recognized.
Net
 cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' revenue and earnings, including certain reach-forward losses, across all long-term contractswere as follows:
 
2018  2017  2016 Increase to Revenue
$137  $559  $394 Increase/(decrease) to Earnings from Operations
($190 )  $250  ($263 ) Increase/(decrease) to Diluted EPS
($0.29 )  $0.34  ($0.36 ) Significant
 adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2018 included reach-forward losses of $736 , $445 and $1,127 on  the USAFKC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2018, 201
7 and 2016.56

Table of ContentsDue to the
 significance of judgment in the estimation process changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstancesmay adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.
Payments
 under  long-term  contracts  may  be  received  before  or  after  revenue  is  recognized.  The  U.S.  government  customer  typically  withholdspayment
 of  a  small  portion  of  the  contract  price  until  contract  completion.  Therefore,  long-term  contracts  typically  generate  Unbilled  receivables(contract
 assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances andprogress
 billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company inthe event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.
Commercial
 spare  parts  contracts Certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  include  sales  of  commercial  spare  parts.  For  each  contract,  wedetermine
 the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fairvalue.
 We  generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Revenue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  partperformance obligation at
 the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare partwhere
 a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination ofthese
 items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded ataverage cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.
Other
 service revenue contracts Certain contracts  at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance,training,
 data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the servicesare
 rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts thetransfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.
Concession
 Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  andservices
 as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessionsincurred
 may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements,which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s pro
ducts or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.Unbilled Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings
Unbilled
 receivables  (contract  assets)  arise  when  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  for  amounts  which  cannot  yet  be  billed  under  terms  of  thecontract
 with  the  customer.  Advances  and  progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  arise  when  the  Company  receives  payments  from  customers  inadvance of recognizing revenue. The amo
unt of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract . Financial
 Services  Revenue We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases,  operating  leases,  and  notesreceivable.
Lease
 and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/financeleases,
 we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual valueof the leased equipment, and deferred
 incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximatea
 level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receiveat lease termination from the disposition of the leased equ
ipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates.57

Table of ContentsDeclines in estimated residual val
ue that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.For
 operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating leaseassets,
 included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimatedresidual
 value,  using  the  straight-line  method.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  byprospectively adjusting
 depreciation expense.For
 notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortizationof any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Reinsurance
 Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  Themember
 agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $145 , $141 
and $147 during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were$136 
, $144 and $139 during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
Fleet Support
We
 provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.Collectively
 known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineeringsupport,
 and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, andtechnical
 consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s operational life. Services provided after delivery include field servicesupport,
 consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineeringdata,
 and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customerfacilities providing and coordi
nating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.Research and Development
Research
 and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design,  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  togovernment produ
cts and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers.Costs
 that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with ourcontract
 accounting  policy.  We  have  certain  research  and  development  arrangements  that  meet  the  requirement  for  best  efforts  research  anddevelopment
 accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expenserather than
 as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $234 , $288 and $311 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 
, respectively. Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of
 share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense basedon
 the  grant-date  fair  value  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  For  awards  settled  in  cash,  or  that  may  be  settled  in  cash,  we  measure  compensationexpense
 based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period,which is generally the vesting perio
d of the award.58

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
Provisions
 for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on currenttax
 law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferredtax
 assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense arerecognized
 in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determiningincome tax provisions and evaluatin
g tax positions.The
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of taxpositions
 taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured forfinancial
 statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such taxpositions
 changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  areclassified as a component of Income tax expense.
Postretirement Plans
The
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a
 company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also providepostretirement
 benefit  plans  other  than  pensions,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  to  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying  dependents.Benefits
 under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for somepension
 plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans isdetermined
 using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term
 rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension andother postretirement income
 or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs,and
 reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarialassumptions,
 are reflected in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets orplan
 liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans isreflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financ
ial Position.Postemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job traini
ng, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumul
ated.59

Table of ContentsEnvironmental Remediation
We
 are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  andremediation
 of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,obligations,
 and commitments  for remediation  of contaminated  sites,  including assessments  of ranges and probabilities of recoveries  from  otherresponsible
 parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmentalremediation
 sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability isbased
 on  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  exposure  for  investigation,  cleanup,  and  monitoring  costs  to  beincurred.
 Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may beable
 to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim forrecovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash
 and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments,which
 have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, andreclassify
 any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payablewere 
$127 and $116 at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Inventories
Inventoried
 costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-recurring
 costs,  and  applicable  overhead,  which  includes  fringe  benefits,  production  related  indirect  and  plant  management  salaries  and  plantservices, not in excess of
 estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixedcosts
 not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costsinclude
 amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within oneyear. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocati
on of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.Commercial aircraft programs
 inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costsincurred for
 production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costsare
 experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (laborand
 other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  thesedeferred
 costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries isbelow
 the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive fromsuppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortize
d to work in process.The
 determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to completeall
 contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision isrecorded.
 The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimaterevenue
 and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  programrevenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss o
n all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.60

Table of ContentsUsed
 aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this
 Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit costor
 net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excessor obsolete inventory,
 based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impairedinventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included
 in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, thatare
 referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of theaircraft under contract
 occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have theability
 to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwiserecoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
Precontract Costs
We
 may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recoveryfrom
 future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalizedprecontract
 costs  are  included  in  Inventories  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Should  future  orders  notmaterialize or we determine the costs are no longer probabl
e of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  aredepreciated principally over the following estimated
 useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery andequipment,
 from 4  to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance;and
 machinery  and  equipment,  sum-of-the-years’  digits.  Capitalized  internal  use  software  is  included  in  Other  assets  and  amortized  using  thestraight line method over 
5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over theterm
 of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciablelives assigned to long-lived ass
ets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.Long-lived
 assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  animpairment
 assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carryingvalue
 is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We
 record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,asset decommissioning and contractual le
ase restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.We
 also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  beperformed in
 the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.Accordingly, these
61

Table of Contentsobligations
 have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period whensufficient
 information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’s fair value. Inaddition,
 there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but wehave
 not  become  aware  of  it  through  the  normal  course  of  business),  and  therefore,  these  obligations  also  have  not  been  included  in  theConsolidated Financial State
ments.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill
 and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized,  but are tested for impairment  annually and when an eventoccurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
We
 test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  aqualitative
 assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the relatedoperations,
 the  two-step  impairment  process  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  operations  where  the  two-stepimpairment
 process  is  used,  we  first  compare  the  carrying  value  of  net  assets  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related  operations.  If  the  fair  value  isdetermined
 to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value forgoodwill
 is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value belowcarrying value represents the amount of goodwill imp
airment.Indefinite-lived
 intangibles  consist  of  brand  and  trade  names  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  bycomparing
 their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying valueover the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.
Our
 finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,from 
4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from2 
to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat
 the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows ofthe asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
Investments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale
 debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-saledebt
 securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded,  net  of  tax,  as  a  component  of  accumulated  othercomprehensive
 income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.Available-for-sale debt securities are assesse
d for impairment quarterly.The
 equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,over
 an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between20% 
and 50% . The cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow cl assification of distributions received from equity method investments.62

Table of ContentsOther
 Equity  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recorded  through  net  earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable
 fair  value  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity  investments  without  readilydeterminable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.
We
 classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-operatin
g in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, includingour
 share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss onthe disposition of these
 investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic
 purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments orgain/loss on the disposition of these inv
estments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.Derivatives
All
 derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.We
 use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes infair
 value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in theperiod of
 change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is toinclude in earni
ngs the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effectiveportion of
 the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same periodor
 periods  during  which  the  hedged  forecasted  transaction  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  of  a  cash  flow  hedge  isreported
 in  earnings  immediately.  We  have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  andinternational
 business  requirements.  These  agreements  are  derivatives  for  accounting  purposes  but  are  not  designated  for  hedge  accountingtreatment.
 We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For thesealuminum
 agreements  and  for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  changes  in  their  fair  value  arerecorded in earnings immediately.
Aircraft Valuation
Used
 aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In  conjunction with signing a definitive agreement forthe
 sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in usedaircraft
 at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certaincustomers
 wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally  10 to 15 years after  delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Ourrepurchase
 of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute anagreement
 for  the  sale  of  additional  new  aircraft,  and  if  the  customer  exercises  its  right  to  sell  the  Sale  Aircraft  to  us,  a  contingent  repurchasecommitment would become a
 trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
63

Table of ContentsExposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)
adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of thefair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recogniz
ed upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or(2)
charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitiveagreement
 for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would beincluded in Accrued liabilitie
s.The
 fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraftand
 similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  mostinstances
 begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to placeused
 aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; theleasing
 market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraftvaluation
 varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuationanalysis
 based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuationsbased on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individu
al attributes and known conditions.Used aircraft
 acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intentto
 sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assetsare included in Customer financing.
Customer
 financing Customer  financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/financeleases are treated as receivables, and allo
wances for losses are established as necessary.We
 assess  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  we  own,  including  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateralunderlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are l
ess than the related assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fairvalues
 of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowancefor losses on receivables.
We
 use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of theaircraft
 to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances,  we apply judgment based on the attributes  of the specific aircraft orequipment,
 usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outsidepublications.
Impairment review for
 assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets  under operating lease orassets
 held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may beless
 than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for howlong
 we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,periods
 in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic lifeof the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
64

Table of ContentsWhen
 we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value overthe fair value of the asset.
Allowance
 for losses on customer financing receivables We  record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuationaccount,
 the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to twocomponents of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluate
d individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.We
 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original contractual terms  of  the  receivable agreement,  without regard  to  any  subsequent restructurings.  Factors  considered inassessing
 collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Wedetermine
 a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of therelated collateral we would exp
ect to realize.We
 review the adequacy of the allowance attributable  to the remaining receivables (after  excluding receivables subject to a specific impairmentallowa
nce) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is theexcess
 of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of thecarrying
 value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customercredit
 ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for eachcustomer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based up
on public information and information obtained directly from our customers.We
 have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable forpurposes
 of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resultingfrom
 a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, forexample,
 permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use theproceeds to cover the shortfall.
Each quarter we review customer
 credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraftvalue
 publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actualresults
 will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowancefor losses on receivables.
Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and design. The majority of
 our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4 -year
 standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards underour
 authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond thestandard
 warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warrantiesissued
 by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates.These
 sales  are  generally  accompanied  by  a six month  to two -year  warranty  period  and  cover  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  andsoftware manufactur
ed by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in whichthe
 related product delivery occurs. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warrantycoverage outstanding for products delivered
65

Table of Contentstimes
 the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normalclaims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are co
nsidered changes to the initial liability estimate.We
 provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraftperformance
 targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on knownand
 anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,and
 anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery ofthe
 related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  suppliedequipment
 to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as areduction
 in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  theprograms’ estimate at completion.
Supplier Penalties
We
 record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount isreasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully a
nticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.Guarantees
We record a
 liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For credit guarantees,the
 liability  is  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the  expected  loss.  We  determine  the  expected  loss  by  multiplying  the  creditor’s  default  rate  by  theguarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery,
 if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of aguarantee,
 we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guaranteeas described above or (b) the probable conting
ent loss amount.Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented
In
 February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016 -  02, Leases
(Topic
842)
. The new standard
 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees toreport
 most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard permitstwo
 approaches,  one  requiring  retrospective  application  of  the  new  guidance  with  restatement  of  prior  years,  and  one  requiring  prospectiveapplication
 of the new guidance. We plan to adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019 and apply it prospectively. We do not expectthe new lease standard to have a material effect on our financia
l position, results of operations or cash flows.66

3 – Acquisitions and Joint VenturesKLX Inc.
On
 October  9,  2018,  we  acquired  all  the  outstanding  shares  of  KLX  Inc.  (KLX).  KLX  is  a  global  provider  of  aviation  parts  and  services  in  theaerospace
 industry.  Its  capabilities  include  distribution  and  supply  chain  services.  The  KLX  acquisition  is  intended  to  accelerate  growth  in  ourservices
 business  by  allowing  Boeing  to  offer  commercial,  defense,  business  and  general  aviation  customers  a  broader  range  of  offerings.  Theresults
 of  KLX’s  operations  have  been  included  in  our  Global  Services  segment  from  the  acquisition  date.  KLX’s  revenues  and  earnings  fromoperations from October 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were 
$356 and $50 .The preliminary allocation of the purchase pric
e was as follows:Cash and cash equivalents
$225 Accounts receivable
260 Inventories
1,321 Other current assets
41 Property, plant & equipment
36 Goodwill
2,110 Intangible assets
965 Other assets
65 Current liabilities
(347 )Other long-te
rm liabilities(180 )Long-term debt
(1,210 ) Total net assets acquired
$3,286 The
 goodwill has been allocated to the Global Services and Commercial Airplanes segments based on revenue synergies expected to be realizedfrom
 the integration of KLX’s products and services and expected cost synergies primarily resulting from the consolidation of procurement spendingand
 functional support. Approximately $533 of  the acquired goodwill and intangible assets is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired intangibleassets primarily relate to customer and supplier relationships a
nd have a weighted-average useful life of 17.5 years . Strategic Partnership with Embraer
On
 July 5, 2018, we and Embraer S.A. (Embraer) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic partnershipbetween
 the two companies. On December 17, 2018, the terms of the strategic partnership were agreed by both companies. The agreed termsdefine
 the  joint  venture  comprising  the  commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  in  which  Boeing  will  acquire  an 80  percentownership stake for 
$4.2 billion . The  companies have also agreed to the terms of another joint venture to promote and develop new markets for themulti-mission
 medium  airlift  KC-390,  in  which  Boeing  will  hold  a 49  percent ownership  stake.  On  January  10,  2019,  the  Government  of  Brazilreviewed
 the terms of the strategic partnership and advised it would not exercise its Golden Share veto power, allowing the transaction to moveforward.
 On January 11, 2019, the Embraer Board of Directors ratified its prior approval of the strategic partnership and authorized execution of thedefinitive
 transaction  documents.  On  January  24,  2019,  the  definitive  transaction  documents  were  executed.  The  transaction  remains  subject  toEmbraer shareholder and
 regulatory approvals, as well as other customary closing conditions. Assuming approvals are received in a timely manner,the transaction is intended to close by

5 – Earnings Per ShareBasic
 and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earningsper
 share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participatingsecurities
 as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributedearnings.
Basic
 earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weightedaverage common shares outstanding.
Diluted
 earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding.

iluted earnings per share were as follows:(In

 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted. The TCJA revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among otherthings,
 lowering the rate from 35% to 21% effective  January  1, 2018, implementing  a territorial  tax system  and imposing a one-time  tax ondeemed
 repatriated  earnings  of  non-U.S.  subsidiaries.  The  TCJA  also  enacted  provisions  which  effectively  apply  a  lower  U.S.  tax  rate  tointangible income derived from serving no
n-U.S. markets. In 2018, we recorded a $549 tax benefit related to foreign derived intangib le income.(2) 
 In the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $412 related to the settlement of the 2013-2014 74

Table of Contentsfederal tax audit. In the third quarter of 2016, a tax benefit of 
$177 was recorded related to the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax aud it.(3) 
 In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $181 , $207 and $105 . (4) 
 In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), in the fourth quarter of 2017, werecorded
 provisional tax benefits of $1,430 related  to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in thecorporate
 tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $159 related  to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. During the fourth quarterof
 2018 and in accordance with SAB 118, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017and recorded an incremental benefit related to refineme
nts to these provisional amounts which was not significant.(5) 
 In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $440 related  to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decisionwhich held that the tax basis in certain assets could be i
ncreased (tax basis adjustment).Significant components of our deferred tax (liabiliti

 Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December  31, 2018 and 2017 are  deferred tax assets in the amounts of $4,275 and $4,636 
related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows:

 deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of thedeferred tax assets will not be realized.
In
 accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP,  the  Company  has  made  an  accounting  policy  election  to  treat  Global  Intangible  Low  Tax  Income  (GILTI)  as  acurrent year tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.
75

Table of ContentsTherefore,
 we have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31,2018.
The
 TCJA one-time repatriation tax and GILTI liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. Wehave
 not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered tobe indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be d
istributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant.As of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-relat ed interest and penalties included in the ConsolidatedStatements
 of  Financial  Position  were  not  significant.  The  amounts  of  interest  included  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  were  notsignificant for the 
years ended December  31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 . A reconciliation of the beginni
ng and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 
2018  2017  2016 Unrecognized tax benefits – January 1
$1,736   $1,557   $1,617 Gross increases – tax positions in prior periods

$2,412   $1,736   $1,557 As
 of December  31 , 2018, 2017 and 2016 ,  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $2,412 , $1,736 and $1,557 ,  respectively, of which$1,405 
, $1,568 and $1,402 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2018 , these amounts are primarily associated with uncertaint
ies in the TCJA and the amount of research tax credits claimed. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issuessuch as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisd
ictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed.Federal
 income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2015. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expected to begin the 2015-2017federal
 tax audit in the first quarter of 2019. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2017 taxyears. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstan
ding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.Audit
 outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 monthsunrecognized tax benefits related to state matters under audit may decrease by up to 
$460 based on current estimates. 76

 determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts dueaccording
 to  the  original  contractual  terms.  At December  31,  2018 and 2017 ,  we  individually  evaluated  for  impairment  customer  financingreceivables
 of $409 and $422 ,  of which $398 and $411 were  determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impairedreceivables as the collateral values exc
eeded the carrying values of the receivables.Income
 recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Incomeis
 recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer . The average recordedinvestment in impaired financing receiva
bles for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $403 , and the related interest income was insignificant. The
 change  in  the  allowance  for  losses  on  financing  receivables  for  the years  ended  December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016 ,  consisted  of  thefollowing:

 adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customerfinancing
 receivables  are  customer  credit  ratings,  default  rates  and  collateral  values.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  anddetermine
 the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers.Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agenc
ies.79

Customer
 financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance andoverall
 market  conditions  and  may  be  subject  to  reduced  valuation  with  market  decline.  Declines  in  collateral  values  could  result  in  assetimpairments,
 reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experience
d greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the fol

13 – Other AssetsSea Launch
At 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 ,  Other assets included $244 and $356 of  receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venturewhich
 became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launch’s bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The net amounts owed to Boeing byeach
 of  the  partners  are  as  follows:  S.P.  Koroley  Rocket  and  Space  Corporation  Energia  of  Russia  (RSC  Energia)  – $111 ,  PO  YuzhnoyeMashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine – 
$89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44 .In
 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launchpartners.
 In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, wereached
 an  agreement  which  we  believe  will  enable  us  to  recover  the  outstanding  receivable  balance  from  RSC  Energia  over  the  next  severalyears.
 We continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to believethe
 partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable tosecure reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian S
ea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges.82

 related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees who were subsequently employed by Spirit. On July 12,2018,
 the  Delaware  Supreme  Court  denied  Boeing’s  claim  for  indemnification.  As  a  result,  in  the  second  quarter  we  wrote  off  the  receivablesattributable to the Spirit indemnifications.

 including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed theserecorded
 amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or thediscovery
 of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios thatincludes the high end of a 
range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on ourexperience
 and  existing  laws  and  regulations.  There  are  some  potential  remediation  obligations  where  the  costs  of  remediation  cannot  bereasonably

In
 conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certaincustomers
 that  give  them  the  right  to  trade  in  used  aircraft  at  a  specified  price  upon  the  purchase  of  Sale  Aircraft.  The  probability  that  trade-incommitments
 will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from othersources.
 The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic andairline
 industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only duringthe period specified in the agreement, and requ
ire advance notice by the customer.Trade-in
 commitment agreements at December  31, 2018 have  expiration dates from 2019 through 2026 .  At December 31, 2018 and 2017 ,  totalcontractual
 trade-in commitments were $1,519 and $1,462 .  As of December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  we estimated that it was probable we would beobligated
 to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling $522 and $155 and  the  fair  value  of  therelated trade-in aircraft was

McDonnell
 Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cashsurrender

 We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31,  2018 and 2017 , the cash
 surrender  value was $466 and $489 and  the  total  loans  were $447 and $470 .  As  we  have  the  right  to  offset  the  loans  against  the  cashsurrender

. United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The
 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, raised the 2011 Budget Control Act spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019(FY18
 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19, in compliance with therevised
 caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agenciesnot
 covered  by  enacted  FY19  appropriations,  including  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  Federal  AviationAdministration
 (FAA),  remains  uncertain.  The  unfunded  departments  and  agencies  affected  by  the  partial  government  shutdown  (December  22,2018
 through  January  25,  2019)  are  now  covered  by  a  Continuing  Resolution  that  extends  funding  at  FY18  levels  through  February  15,2019.
 Congress  and  the  President  must  agree  to  FY19  appropriations  or  an  additional  Continuing  Resolution  to  fund  affected  departments  andagencie
s beyond the February 15 deadline in order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdownto the Company’s operations would incre
ase as the shutdown continues. There
 continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, includingNASA.
 The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20and FY21). The
 lower budget caps will take effect again in FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspendthe law. As a
 result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority changescould
 result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on theresults of the Company’s operations, financial pos
ition and/or cash flows.BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
Fixed-price
 development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete thework.
 BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-25B
 Presidential  Aircraft,  MQ-25  Stingray,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  The  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  these  contractscreate
 financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost andrevenue estimates
 could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have recorded reach-forward losseson the
 KC-46A Tanker in 2018 as well as in prior years, and we continue to have risk for further losses if we experience further production, technicalor quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification a
nd/or85

Table of Contentsdelivery.
 In addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 associated with
 options for 346 T-X Trainer aircraft  and a loss of $291 related  to the MQ-25 Stingray Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD)contract.
 Moreover, our fixed-price development programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical orquality issues, schedule delays, or increas
ed costs. KC-46A Tanker
In
 2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerialrefueling
 tankers. This EMD contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9  billion and  involves highly complex designs and systemsintegration.
 In 2016, the USAF authorized  two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8  billion and  in 2017, the USAF authorized an additionalLRIP
 lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1  billion .  On September 10, 2018, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $2.9 billion 
. In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF . At 
December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $370 of capitalized precontract costs and $550 of potential termination liabilities to sup pliers.Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our
 final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demandsrelated to
 costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reservefor
 amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or providerefunds to the U.S. government.
Note 
15 – Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet RiskWe enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily i
n the form of guarantees.The
 following  table  provides  quantitative  data  regarding  our  third  party  guarantees.  The  maximum  potential  payments  represent  a  “worst-casescenario,”

Indemnifications
 to  ULA In  2006,  we  agreed  to  indemnify  ULA  through  December  31,  2020  against  potential  non-recoverability  and  non-allowability
 of $1,360 of  Boeing  Delta  launch  program  inventory  included  in  contributed  assets  plus $1,860 of  inventory  subject  to  an  inventorysupply agreement which ends on 
March 31, 2021 . See Note 8 . ULA has yet to consume $52 of contributed inventory.We
 also agreed to indemnify ULA for up to $261 in  the event ULA was unable to obtain sufficient additional contract pricing from the USAF forcertain
 satellite missions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ULA and the USAF entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the USAF makinga payment of 
$240 to ULA. Potential
 payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. In June2011,
 the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency  (DCMA)  notified  ULA  that  it  had  determined  that $271 of  deferred  support  costs  are  notrecoverable
 under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred
 production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAFfor collection of deferred support
 and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA’s certified claim in May 2012. In 2012, Boeingand
 ULA, through its subsidiary United Launch Services, filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support andproduction
 costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred supportcost
 invoices. We believe that the U.S. government’s counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017. Boeingfiled
 a motion on November 17, 2017, asking the court to award full recovery without a trial. The court denied Boeing’s motion on August 29, 2018.The
 court has entered the parties’ proposed pre-trial schedule providing for a final pre-trial conference on or before October 17, 2019. If, contrary toour
 belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-taxlosses and make indemnification payme
nts to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA. Other Indemnifications 
In conjunction with our  sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and ourBCA
 facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relatingto pre-closing environm
ental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be assertedunder
 these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future paymentsunder these
 indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or areprobable and reasonably estima
ble, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 14 .Credit Guarantees 
We have issued credit guarantees where  we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the originallessee
 or  debtor  does not  make  payments  or  perform  certain  specified  services.  Generally,  these  guarantees  have been extended  on behalf  ofguaranteed
 parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expirethrough 
2036 . 87

17 – Postretirement PlansThe
 majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that hadparticipat
ed in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional unionemployees transitioned to company-funded d
efined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are pl
aced in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants, and are structuredto
 maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for futurebenefit payments.
We
 also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees andqualifying
 dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 forapproximately
 half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most UnitedAuto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime h
ealth care coverage.89

Table of ContentsThe
 funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). Wehave
 recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree healthcare
 or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceedsthe fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrue

The
 following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each yearand the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.

2018  2017  2016 Discount rate:
        Pension
4.20 % 3.60 % 4.00 %Other postretirement benefits

5.30 % 5.30 % 4.40 %Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans
5.15 % 5.15 % 5.15 %The
 discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high qualitybonds that
 are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yieldsdeveloped
 from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The presentvalue of each plan’s benefits is calcu
lated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets
 assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust andanticipated
 future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,the
 assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for theupcoming
 plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA).Since
 our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of planassets. As of 
December 31, 2018 , the MRVA was approximately $3,435 more than the fair market value of assets. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:

Table of ContentsPlan Assets
Investment Strategy 
The overall  objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pensionplans
 and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives forour
 long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  totalinvestment
 return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset classare determined based on specific risks and investment op
portunities identified.We
 periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider planliability
 characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investmentbenchmarks
 to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.Actual allocations to
 each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the lengthof
 time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments andexchange-traded
 derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored andrebalanced periodical
ly. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows: 
Actual Allocations   Target Allocations Asset Class

 income  securities  are  invested  primarily  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  long  duration  instruments.  Global  equity  securities  are  invested  in  adiversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various i
ndustries and market capitalizations.Real
 estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fundstructures
 and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but isnot
 limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in naturalresources
 (such  as  energy,  farmland  and  timber),  commodities  and  infrastructure.  Private  equity  investment  vehicles  are  primarily  limitedpartnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged b
uyout, venture capital and special situation strategies.Hedge
 fund investments  seek to capitalize on inefficiencies  identified across and within different  asset classes or markets.  Hedge fund strategytypes include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relativ
e value, long-short and multi-strategy.Investment
 managers are retained for explicit investment  roles specified by contractual  investment  guidelines. Certain investment  managers areauthorized
 to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve thedesired
 market  exposure  of  a  security  or  an  index,  transfer  value-added  performance  between  asset  classes,  achieve  the  desired  currencyexposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalanc
e the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.93

Table of ContentsAs
 a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 4.4% and 5.0% for  fixed income, including to-be-announcedmortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 
5.5% and 6.9% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . In 2017,
 the Company contributed $3,500 of  our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidatethe stock over time at its discretion. The liquidation of the common stock holdings was comp
leted in the fourth quarter of 2017.Risk
 Management In  managing  the  plan  assets,  we  review  and  manage  risk  associated  with  funded  status  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  market  risk,counterparty
 risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approachand
 are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  byinvestment manager, by industry or
 sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitoredregularly
 through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counterderivatives.
 Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuationprocesses, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconcil
iation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing . 94

Table of ContentsFair Value Measurements 
The  following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,  2018 and 2017 . The fair value
 hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based onquoted
 prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3includes fair values estimated using sig
nificant unobservable inputs.

 income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  othersecurities
 for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single presentvalue amount. Inputs used in developi
ng fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.Common/collective/pooled
 funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager orsponsor
 of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued usingan
 income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates.Exchang
e-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflectedin the payables and receivabl
es portion of the table.Cash
 equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingledfund
 (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued dailyusing
 a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  forinstruments
 with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equitysecurities are primarily valued using a market approach b
ased on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.Private
 equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,operating
 results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows a
nd significant events.Real
 estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discountedfuture
 cash  flows,  independent  appraisals  and  market  based  comparable  data.  For  those  investments  reported  on  a  one-quarter  lagged  basis(primarily
 LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valuedusing
 a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported inaccordance with changes in dai
ly variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.Hedge
 fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  incomevaluation methodology dep
ending on the specific type of security or instrument held.Investments
 in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner(GP),
 fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles andare
 valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments asthe practical expedient for the valuations.

 the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits requiredby 
ERISA ,  and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and lifeinsurance benefits in our group insuranc

 we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will beentitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets base
d on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.Defined Contribution Plans
We
 provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expensefor these defined contribution plans was 
$1,480 , $1,522 and $1,413 in 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Note

 employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuanceunder the plan is 
87,000,000 . Shares
 issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extentthere
 are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfythese issuances during

Performance-
Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total shareholder return as compared toa
 group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of  the initial PBRSU grant. PBRSUs granted inFebruary
 2017 and 2016 will not exceed 400% of  the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this programwill
 vest  at  the  payout  amount  and  settle  in  common  stock  (on  a  one-for-one  basis)  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  If  an  executiveterminates employment because
 of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the awardand,
 if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all othercases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.
In
 February  2018,  2017 and 2016 ,  we  granted  to  our  executives 241,284 , 492,273 and 721,176 PBRSUs  as  part  of  our  long-term  incentiveprogram.
 Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. Thegrant
 date  fair  values  were  estimated  using  a  Monte-Carlo  simulation  model  with  the  assumptions  presented  below.  The  model  includes  noexpected dividend yield as

Performance Awards
Performance
 Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unithas
 an initial value of $100 dollars.  The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per
 unit, depending on the Company’s performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to paythese
 awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimatedperformance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.
During 
2018, 2017 and 2016 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program with the payout bas edon the achievement of financial goals for each three-ye
ar period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximumamount we could be required to pay out for the 
2018, 2017 and 2016 Performance Awards is $369 , $332 and $310 , respectively. The 2016 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in 
March 2019 . Deferred Compensation
The
 Company has deferred compensation plans which permit employees to defer a portion of their salary, bonus, certain other incentive awards,and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts amon

20 – Derivative Financial InstrumentsCash Flow Hedges
Our
 cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts tomanage
 currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreign  currencies.  Our  foreigncurrency
 contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through 2024 .  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-price  purchase  commitments  tohedge
 against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through2021 
. Fair Value Hedges
Interest
 rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change infair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in B
oeing Capital interest expense.103

Table of ContentsWe
 have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least fiveyears,
 our  derivative  counterparties  could  require  settlement  if  we  default  on  our  five-year  credit  facility.  For  certain  commodity  contracts,  ourcounterparties
 could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commoditycontracts
 that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2018 was $35 . At December 31, 2018 , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.
Note 
21 – Fair Value MeasurementsThe
 fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determinedbased
 on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, andLevel 3 includes fair values estimated
 using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measuredat fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized usi
ng the fair value hierarchy.

 market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted marketprices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable i
nstruments.Derivatives
 include foreign  currency,  commodity  and interest  rate  contracts.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are valued using an incomeapproach
 based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valuedusing
 an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Thefair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analys
is based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.105

Table of ContentsCertain
 assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  tablepresents
 the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and assetclassification of the related assets as of the impairment date:

$145  ($93 ) $113  ($101 ) Investments,
 Acquired  intangible  assets  and  Property,  plant  and  equipment  were  primarily  valued  using  an  income  approach  based  on  thediscounted
 cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating amedian
 collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publicationsare derived from their knowledge of market trades
 and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continuedappropriateness
 and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of thespecific
 aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered bythird party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft.
For Level 3 assets that were measure
d at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2018 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques a
nd related unobservable inputs of those assets.

 The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third partyaircraft valuation publications that we use in o
ur valuation process.(2) 
 The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on considerationof individual aircraft attributes and condition. The p
ositive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments.106

 notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar termsto borrowers of similar credit quality. The
 fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on currentmarket yields. For
 our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowingcost
 derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flowmodels
 using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable toestimate
 the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain.Items not
 included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds,Accounts
 receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, asreflected
 in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position,  approximate  their  fair  value  at December  31,  2018  and  2017 .  The fair  value ofassets and liabilities whose carryin
g value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).Note 
22 – Legal ProceedingsVarious legal proceedin
gs, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.In
 addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings couldresult or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings inv
olve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and trebledamages, restitution and/or forfeitures.
 Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can alsobe
 suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based uponcurrent
 information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect onour financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

23 – Segment and Revenue InformationOur
 primary profitability measurements to review a segment’s operating results are Earnings from operations and operating margins. We operate infour 
reportable segments: BCA , BDS , BGS , and BCC . All other activities fall within Unall ocated items, eliminations and other. See page 53 for theSummary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.
BCA 
develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  principally  to  the  commercial  airline  industry  worldwide.  Revenue  on  commercialaircraft
 contracts  is  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  when  an  aircraft  is  completed  and  accepted  by  the  customer.  Revenue  on  certain  militaryderivative aircraft contracts is recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BDS 
engages  in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmannedmilitary
 aircraft  and  weapons  systems,  surveillance  and  engagement,  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  satellite  systems  and  spaceexploration. BDS revenue is genera
lly recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.BGS 
provides  parts,  maintenance,  modifications,  logistics  support,  training,  data  analytics  and  information-based  services  to  commercial  andgovernment
 customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain services provided to other segments. Revenue on commercialspare
 parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is generallyrecognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BCC 
facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financin g solutions for our Boeing customers.While
 our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors are located in Europe andJapan. Revenues, includin
g foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and consist of the following:Years ended December 31,

 an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to the Company’s change in methodof accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.

 of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  FinancialReporting.
 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a publicaccounting
 firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federalsecurities laws and the applicab
le rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable

 and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reaso
nable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
 over Financial ReportingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and that receipts and expenditures of the company are bei
ng made only in accordance with authorizations of115

 and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorizedacquisition,
 use,  or  disposition  of  the  company’s  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial  statements.  Because  of  its  inherentlimitations,
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness tofuture
 periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.
