for any references to Note 1 through Note 20, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Available Information
The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that
file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that the Company files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The Company files
annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
3M also makes available free of charge through its website (http://investors.3M.com) the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on

General
3M is a diversified technology company with a global presence in the following businesses
: 
Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health
Care; and Consumer. 3M is among the leading manufacturers of products for many of the markets it serves. Most 3M products involve expertise in product
development, manufacturing and marketing, and are subject to competition from products manufactured and sold by other technologically oriented
companies.
At December 31, 2019, the Company employed 96,163 people (full-time equivalents), with 39,662 employed in the United States and 56,501 employed
internationally.
Business Segments
As described in Notes 4 and 19, effective in the second quarter of 2019, the Company realigned its former five business segments into four to enable the
Company to better serve global customers and markets. In addition, certain product lines were moved to better align with their respective end customers.
Earlier in the first quarter of 2019, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of businesses
around markets and customers. These changes included the realignment of certain customer account activity in various countries (affecting dual credit
reporting), creation of the Closure and Masking Systems and Medical Solutions divisions, and certain other actions that impacted segment reporting.
Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 
3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and
Consumer. 3M’s four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and
services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Financial information and other disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments and
operations in major geographic areas are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Research and Patents
Research and product development constitutes an important part of 3M’s activities and has been a major driver of 3M’s sales and profit growth. Research,
development and related expenses totaled $1.911 billion in 2019, $1.821 billion in 2018 and $1.870 billion in 2017. Research and development, covering
basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion
in 2019, $1.253 billion in 2018 and $1.352 billion in 2017. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which
include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process
research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects
and impairments.
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign
patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to
specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
The Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of
related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.
Raw Materials
In 2019, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across many material markets in all geographies. In response, the Company continued to
deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations,
and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the
Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future
shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply
sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. In addition,
3M evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.
Environmental Law Compliance
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making,
necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past
operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed.
Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally
no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
In 2019, 3M expended approximately $59 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for
remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital
expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers,
containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of
business. The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. While capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for
known projects are presently expected to be approximately $150 million to $220 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build
facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of

such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings
or competitive position.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7,
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may also make forward-
looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In
addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance. Words such as
“plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “forecast” and other words and terms
of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include, among others, statements relating to:
●
the Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance, and market
position,
●
worldwide economic, political, regulatory, capital markets and other external conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
financial conditions of our suppliers and customers, trade restrictions such as tariffs in addition to retaliatory counter measures, and natural and other
disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or our suppliers and customers,
●
new business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,

The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual
future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of
factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,” “Financial Condition and Liquidity,” and annually in “Critical
Accounting Estimates.” Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be
considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional
information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on
Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.
Item 1A. 
Risk Factors
Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors
is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations.”
* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, capital markets and other external conditions.
 The
Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company’s business
is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and has been and will in the future be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other
countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained
or widespread recessionary conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international
trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in
specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or
regions; natural and other disasters, including public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, affecting the operations of the Company or its
customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate
earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Natural occurrences and human activities are increasingly releasing
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. Climate change, as well as related environmental and social
regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of
energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate.
* 
The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
substances produced by the Company, collectively known as “PFAS.” The PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and
materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the
carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS critical to the manufacture of
electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes.
Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including
3M, and are used in everyday products. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that
PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate
(PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and
surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam
(AFFF) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and
is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of
jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An adverse outcome in
any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal
fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the
presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface
Table of Contents
11
water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for
damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for
our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise.
* The Company’s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including
those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S.
trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-
related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, the Sunshine Act, or other matters.
 The outcome of these legal
proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably
predict. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be
covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of
liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as
a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling,
settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
cash flows in any particular period. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety matters involving the
Company may negatively impact the Company’s reputation. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the
associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
 Demand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue
and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward
pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of
customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve
incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in
customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company’s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to
disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available
data.
* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and
earnings. 
Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are
derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be
adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to
continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
 This ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development,
such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are
no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy,
including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters
and other factors.
 The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their
derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to natural
and other disasters and other events, or be terminated. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material
adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be
given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system as part of
business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information
technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers,
and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. 
In the ordinary course of business,
the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,
transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data,
including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and
security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of
networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure are still
potentially be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages,
computer viruses, ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other
catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. While we have
experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of vulnerabilities to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure,
none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its
ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruptions or
shutdowns, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance
coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business
strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. 
The Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure
and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to
acquisitions, including, for example, the recently completed acquisition of Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology
company), future results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. The
Company realigned from five to four business segments, effective in April of 2019, to better serve its global customers and markets. Successful execution
of the realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model, as well as other organizational changes, will be important
to the Company’s future results.
* The Company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity
improvements than estimated.
 The Company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes
various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes
and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while
allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise
resource planning (ERP) system. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. Operational challenges,
including those related to productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial conditions and results of
operations.
* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.
 The
performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in
market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined
benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.
 The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major
rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which
include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has
an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service and has an AA- credit rating with Standard & Poor’s; Standard & Poor’s placed
3M on “CreditWatch Negative” in January 2020. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety
of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain

strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.

Item 2. 
Propertie
s.
In the U.S., 3M’s general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in St. Paul, Minnesota. The Company
operates 71 manufacturing facilities in 29 states. Internationally, the Company operates 100 manufacturing and converting facilities in 35 countries.
3M owns the majority of its physical properties. 3M’s physical facilities are highly suitable for the purposes for which they were designed. Because 3M is a
global enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business segments.
Item 3. 
Legal Proceeding
s.
Discussion of legal matters is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of this document, and should be
considered an integral part of Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”
Item 4. 
Mine Safety
 Disclosures.
Pursuant to Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), the Company is required to disclose, in
connection with the mines it operates, information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters in its periodic reports filed with the SEC.
For the year 2019, the information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Act is included in
Exhibit 95 to this annual report.

PART II
Item 5. 
Market for Registrant’
s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
Equity compensation plans’ information is incorporated by reference from Part III, Item 12, “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management and Related Stockholder Matters,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Item 5. At January 31, 2020, there were
73,905 shareholders of record. 3M’s stock ticker symbol is MMM and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE), the Chicago Stock
Exchange, Inc., and the SWX Swiss Exchange. Cash dividends declared and paid totaled $1.44 and $1.36 per share for each quarter in 2019 and 2018,
respectively.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Repurchases of 3M common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In
November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program
authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date.

per diluted share, for year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of 12.1 percent on a per diluted share basis.
The Company refers to various “adjusted” amounts or measures on an “adjusted basis”. These exclude the 2019 charge related to the deconsolidation of the
Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary, the 2018 and 2019 significant litigation-related charges, and the 2017 enactment and 2018 measurement period
adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded related to the 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). These non-GAAP measures are
further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant
litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures)
 section below.
On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to 3M was $5.322 billion, or $9.10 per diluted share for 2019 compared to $6.295 billion, or $10.46 per diluted
share for 2018, a decrease of 13.0 percent on a per diluted share basis.
For 2019, while 3M experienced sales growth in its Consumer and Health Care segments, this was more than offset by declines in 3M’s Safety and
Industrial and Transportation and Electronics segments. These two businesses were impacted by softness in certain end markets (China, automotive and
electronics) and channel inventory adjustments, particularly within Asia Pacific and the United States. Earnings were also impacted by second quarter
restructuring actions taken to address lower sales volumes, as well as inventory reductions to drive improved cash flow. Further restructuring actions were
taken in fourth quarter to realign 3M’s organizational structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency. Partially offsetting these
impacts were benefits in the second half of 2019 from the second quarter restructuring actions.
Additional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in earnings per diluted share follows:
2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions:
●
In 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million as a result of
this divestiture and was reported within the Company’s Safety and Industrial business
. During 2018, management approved and committed to
undertake certain restructuring actions as further described in Note 5, related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication
Markets Division divestiture resulting in a 2018 pre-tax charge of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates of $10 million.
The aggregate net impact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 50 cents per diluted share for
the full year 2018.
Organic growth/productivity and other:
●
Negative organic local-currency sales growth as a result of softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions
taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption, reduced
earnings per diluted share. Partially offsetting these impacts were benefits from restructuring actions taken in the second quarter of 2019.
●
Defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense decreased expense year-on-year, which benefited earnings per diluted share.
●
Lower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year.
●
Interest expense (net of interest income) increased $88 million for 2019, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances, partially offset by the
increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting from the proceeds
from debt issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition.
2019 restructuring actions:
●
During the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, and additionally in the fourth quarter to realign 3M’s organizational
structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency, management approved and committed to undertake certain
restructuring actions. The Company recorded a fourth quarter 2019 pre-tax
Table of Contents
18
charge of $134 million and second quarter 2019 pre-tax charge of $148 million, which when combined, resulted in a full year 2019 impact of 41
cents per diluted share. See Note 5 for additional details.
Acquisitions/divestitures:
●
Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and
Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). These items collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 19 cents year-on-year for 2019. The net impacts
related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Interest expense related to
financing costs of these acquisitions is also included. Expenses related to the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity also include financing costs and
the tax effect of repatriating funds in advance of the close of the acquisition.
●
Divestiture impacts include the incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestitures and the lost operating income from divested businesses (other
than lost income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division). These items collectively increased earnings per diluted share by
16 cents year-on-year for 2019. The net impacts included 14 cents for 2019 related to the gain from the third quarter 2019 divestiture of the
Company’s gas and flame detection business and 7 cents from the second quarter 2019 “held for sale” tax benefit related to the legal entities
associated with the divestiture. Other incremental year-on-year gains/losses on divestitures and the lost operating income from divested businesses
decreased earnings per share by 5 cents for 2019.
●
In addition to divestiture impacts above, remaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the 2018 divestiture of the Communication
Markets Division decreased earnings per diluted share by 4 cents year-on-year for 2019.
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) were essentially flat year-on-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates.
Income tax rate
:
●
Certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.8 percent, a decrease of 3.6
percentage points versus 2018. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate decreased 0.5 percentage points year-on-year for
2019.
●
Factors that decreased the effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2019 included prior year measurement period adjustments related to 2017 Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit (as described in Note 16) and geographical income mix. These decreases were
partially offset by the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges.
Refer to Note 10 for additional details.
Shares of common stock outstanding:
●
Lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share year-on-year by 22 cents per diluted share for 2019. Weighted-average diluted shares
outstanding in 2019 declined 2.8 percent year-on-year which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted
shares relates to the Company’s purchase of $1.4 billion of its own stock in 2019.
Year 2018 EPS:
2017 divestiture of identity management business
:
●
In May 2017, 
3M completed the divestiture of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain of $457 million, which was reported
within the Company’s Transportation and Electronics business.
Organic growth/productivity and other:
●
2018 year-on-year benefits include higher organic local-currency sales, selling price increases, and business transformation, which had a positive
impact on 3M’s productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs partially offset these year-on-year benefits.
●
Lower year-on-year restructuring (other than activity related to the Communication Markets Division divestiture), portfolio and footprint actions
increased pre-tax earnings by approximately $307 million in 2018. 2017 charges included $99 million in restructuring actions and $207 million in
asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs.
●
Interest expense (net of interest income) increased $8 million year-on-year. While 2017 interest expense included a $96 million early debt
extinguishment charge, 2018 net interest expense increased as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and higher borrowing costs.
Table of Contents
19
●
On a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense, in addition to lower
income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year.
Acquisitions/other divestiture gains:
●
In aggregate, acquisitions, year-on-year divestitures gains (other than the sale of the Communication Markets Division and identity management
business), and lost operating income from divested businesses (other than lost income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets
Division) decreased earnings per diluted share by 10 cents in 2018.
●
Remaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division decreased earnings per
diluted share by 5 cents year-on-year in 2018.
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings year-on-year by approximately $42 million, or the equivalent of 5 cents per
diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates.
Income tax rate:
●
Certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. The effective tax rate for full year 2018 was 23.4 percent, a decrease of
12.1 percentage points versus 2017. On an adjusted basis (as described below), the effective income tax rate was 20.1 percent for 2018 versus 25.4
percent for 2017.
●
Factors that decreased the effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2018 primarily related to the favorable aspects of the TCJA such as the decrease in
the U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to transition tax and
remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and increased benefits from the R&D tax credit. These decreases were partially offset by the
elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision, and lower excess tax benefits
related to employee share-based payments. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.
Shares of common stock outstanding:
●
Lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share by 18 cents per diluted share for full year 2018. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding
in 2018 declined 1.8 percent year-on-year, which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares
relates to the Company’s purchase of $4.9 billion of its own stock in the 2018.
2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions and exit activities:
●
As discussed above, in 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509
million as a result of this divestiture. The divestiture was reported within the Company’s Safety and Industrial business
. Also as discussed above,
during 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs
following the Communication Markets Division divestiture that resulted in a pre-tax charge of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost
estimates. The aggregate net impact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 50 cents per diluted
share for 2018.
Certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary, and
enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures):
In 2019, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated
compounds) matters and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits of which $214 million ($166 million after tax) occurred in the fourth quarter. The
aggregate 2019 pre-tax charge was reflected in cost of sales ($328 million) and selling, general and administrative expense ($434 million). In 2018, 3M
recorded significant litigation-related charges of $897 million ($770 million after tax) for PFAS matters related to the previously disclosed agreement
reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resource Damages (NRD) lawsuit. Essentially all of the aggregate 2018 pre-tax charge was
reflected in selling, general and administrative expense. These charges are further discussed in Note 16.
In the second quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary as
further discussed in Note 1.
Table of Contents
20
With respect to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), 3M recorded a $762 million tax expense in 2017 and additional net tax expense of
$176 million in 2018 as a measurement period adjustment to the TCJA’s enactment. See Note 10 for details.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of
significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary and measurement period adjustments to the enactment of
the TCJA. These items represent significant amounts that impacted the Company’s financial results. Operating income, income before taxes, net income,
earnings per share, and effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted
measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and
managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a
useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies.

Additional information beyond what is included in the preceding table is as follows:
●
In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China/Hong Kong total sales increased 10 percent and organic local-currency sales increased 8 percent. In
Japan, total sales and organic local currency sales decreased 2 percent.
●
In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 1 percent in Mexico, as organic local-currency sales increases of 4 percent were
partially offset by lost sales from divested businesses and foreign currency translation impacts. In Canada, total sales and organic local currency
increased 5 percent. In Brazil, total sales decreased 8 percent, as organic local-currency sales growth of 5 percent was more than offset by foreign
currency translation impacts.
Foreign currency translation increased year-on-year sales by 0.2 percent, with the translation-related sales increase in EMEA and Asia Pacific partially
offset by the decreases in Latin America/Canada. Selling prices increased by 1.1 percent year-on-year for 2018, with strong price growth in Latin
America/Canada, EMEA and the U.S. In Asia Pacific, price grew slightly, as strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price.
Managing currency risks:
The stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2019 compared to the same period last year. Net of the Company’s hedging strategy,
foreign currency was neutral to earnings for full year 2019 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to hedge currency risk
related to earnings. 3M uses natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency and hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply.
3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24
or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more
limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is

24
largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3M’s hedging approach is designed to mitigate
a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.
Financial condition:
3M generated $7.070 billion of operating cash flow in 2019, an increase of $631 million when compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to
significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments that impacted 2019 and 2018. This followed an operating cash flow increase of
$199 million when comparing 2018 to 2017. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a discussion of items
impacting cash flows.
In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new
program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2019, the Company
purchased $1.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $4.9 billion in 2018 and $2.1 billion in 2017. The Company expects to purchase
approximately $1.0 billion of its own stock in 2020. In February 2020, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2020 dividend of $1.47 per share,
an increase of 2 percent. This marked the 62
nd
 consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.
Raw materials:
In 2019, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across many material markets in all geographies. In response, the Company continued to
deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations,
and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the
Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future
shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply
sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. In addition,
3M evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.
Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:
On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2019. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is
approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 93 percent funded and the international pension plans were 87 percent funded. The U.S.
non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2019 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were
16.3%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified
pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2020 is 6.75%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2019
discount rate was 3.25%, down 1.11 percentage points from the year-end 2018 discount rate of 4.36%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an
increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan’s funded status decreased 3 percentage points in
2019 due to the higher PBO resulting from the significant discount rate decrease and partially offset by higher return on assets. Additional detail and
discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).
3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2020. The
Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2020. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and
postretirement expense in 2020 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $34 million pre-tax
when compared to 2019. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional
information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.

2020 closed and recently announced divestitures:
As discussed in Note 3, in December 2019, 3M agreed to sell substantially all of its drug delivery business for approximately $650 million in consideration,
subject to closing and other adjustments. 3M expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $400 million as a result of the divestiture that will be reported within
the Company’s Health Care business. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2020.
Also as discussed in Note 3, in January 2020, 3M completed the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business for $91 million, subject to closing and
other adjustments, plus contingent consideration of up to $25 million depending on the outcome of pending tenders. The Company previously reflected an
immaterial impact in 2019 as a result of measuring the disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Operating income margins decreased year over year for both 2019 and 2018. The decrease from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by softness in certain
end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which
resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption. Additionally, higher year-on-year restructuring actions taken decreased operating income
margins, partially offset by lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was driven primarily by the charge
related to the significant litigation-related charges (as discussed in the 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
 section below). A number of factors
impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost
management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various
sections below. Pension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and
research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense decreased $58 million in
2019, compared to an increase of $21 million in 2018. Refer to Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic
benefit costs.
The Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business
transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well
as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.
Cost of Sales:
Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
Cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased during full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. Increases primarily related to lower sales
volume year-on-year, which resulted in cost absorption penalties from lower sales volumes as all businesses worked to reduce inventories and improve cash
flow and significant litigation-related charges taken in 2019 (as discussed earlier in the

charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan

subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures)
. These factors were
partially offset by selling price increases, which increased net sales year-on-year by 0.6 percent for full year 2019.
Cost of sales as a percent of sales, increased during 2018 primarily due to foreign currency effects (net of hedge losses). Additionally, cost of sales for full
year 2018 were increased by the 2018 Communication Markets Division related restructuring charges as discussed in Note 5. This increase was partially
offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018 and selling price increases. Selling prices increased net
sales year-on-year by 1.1 percent for full year 2018. These were partially offset by raw material cost increases and higher defined benefit pension and
postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
SG&A in dollars decreased 7.5 percent for full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. The decrease primarily related to indirect cost reductions and
lower year-on-year impact related to significant litigation-related charges (as discussed earlier in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant
litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures)
 section).
SG&A in dollars increased 14.7 percent for full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. The increase is primarily associated with the Communication
Markets Division-related restructuring charges (as discussed in Note 5) and the charge related to the Minnesota NRD resolution (as discussed earlier in the
Certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary, and
enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures) 
section and further in Note 16). This
increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018.
Research, Development and Related Expenses:
R&D in dollars increased $90 million for the full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. R&D, measured as a percent of sales was 5.9% in 2019,
compared to 5.6% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2017. The increase from 2018 was driven by 3M continued investment in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at
disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. In addition, R&D increased due to additional
spending related to the Company’s acquisitions in 2019.
R&D in dollars decreased $49 million for full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. The decrease primarily relates to R&D no longer incurred related
to the Communication Markets Division, which was divested in 2018.
Gain on Sale of Businesses:
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain oral care technology comprising a business and reflected an earnout on a previous divestiture
resulting in an aggregate immaterial gain. During 2019, the Company sold its gas and flame detection business for a pre-tax gain of $112 million. 3M also
divested certain businesses in 2018 and 2017, resulting in gains of $547 million and $586 million, respectively. Refer to Note 3 for additional details on
these divestitures.

Additional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in operating income margins follows:
2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions
:
●
In 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million as a result of
this divestiture
. During 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions as described in Note 5 related to
addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture resulting in a 2018 pre-tax charge of $127, net of
adjustments for reductions in cost estimates of $10 million.
Organic volume/productivity and other:
●
Negative organic local sales volume growth as a result of 
softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions
taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption, reduced
operating margins. P
artially offsetting these impacts were 
benefits from restructuring actions taken in the second quarter of 2019
.
●
Operating income margins increased year-on-year due to lower defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense.
Table of Contents
28
2019 restructuring actions:
●
During the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, and additionally in the fourth quarter to realign 3M’s organizational
structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency, management approved and committed to undertake certain
restructuring actions. Of the total $282 million charge reflected in 2019, $148 million was recorded in the second quarter, of which $35 million was
associated with a voluntary retirement incentive program that impacted second quarter other expense (income), and an additional $134 million
recorded in the fourth quarter.
Acquisitions/divestitures:
●
Acquisition-related impacts relate to the on-going integration of M*Modal and Acelity, which decreased operating income margins year-on-year.
●
Divestiture impacts (which is comprised of higher year-on-year divestiture gains other than the Communication Markets Division in addition to lost
operating income from divested businesses) increased operating income margins year-on-year and primary related to the gain from the divestiture of
the Company’s gas and flame detection business.
●
Remaining stranded costs to be addressed from the 2018 divestiture of the Communication Markets Division also reduced operating margins year-
on-year.
Selling price and raw material impact:
●
Higher selling prices, partially offset by raw material cost increases, benefited operating income margins year-on-year for 2019.
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency effects (net of hedge gains) increased operating income margins year-on-year.
Significant litigation-related charges
:
●
Operating income margins for 2018 and 2019 included the $897 million and $762 million impact, respectively, of significant litigation-related
charges (as discussed earlier in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s
Venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures)
section.
Year 2018 operating income:
Operating income margins decreased 2.3 percentage points for the full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017.
2017 divestiture of identity management business:
●
Operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to the gain on the May 2017 divestiture of the Company’s former identity management
business.
Organic volume/productivity and other:
●
Operating income margins increased year-on-year due to benefits from organic local-currency growth and productivity, in addition to lower year-on-
year portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges.
●
Operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined
contribution expense.
Acquisitions/other divestiture gains:
●
Acquisition impacts (primarily related to Scott Safety), in addition to lower year-on-year divestiture gains (excluding the identity management
business and Communication Markets Division), decreased operating margins year-on-year.
●
Remaining stranded costs to be addressed from the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division reduced operating margins year-on-year.
●
Operating income margins increased year-on-year due to the lost lower-margin operating income from divested businesses.
Selling price and raw material impact:
●
Higher selling prices, partially offset by raw material cost increases, benefited operating income margins year-on-year.
Table of Contents
29
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency effects (net of hedge gains) decreased operating income margins year-on-year for the full year 2018.
2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions:
●
As discussed above, in 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509
million as a result of this divestiture. Also as discussed above, 
during 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring
actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture that resulted in a pre-tax charge
of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates.
Significant litigation-related charges:
●
Operating income margins for 2018 decreased 2.7 percentage points year-on-year as a result of significant litigation-related charges. See the 
Certain
amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary, and
enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures) 
section for further details.
Other Expense (Income), Net:
See Note 6 for a detailed breakout of this line item.
Interest expense (net of interest income) increased during 2019 and 2018. The increase in 2019 was driven by higher U.S. average debt balances, partially
offset by the year-on-year increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting
from the proceeds from debt issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition. While 2017 interest expense included a $96 million early debt
extinguishment charge, 2018 net interest expense increased as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and higher borrowing costs.
The increase in other expense (income) during 2019 was primarily due to the impact of deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary. Refer to
Note 1 for additional details.
In addition, other expense (income) was impacted by lower year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service benefits of $5 million
and $55 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The lower year-on-year benefit in 2019 was primarily due to the second quarter 2019 charge associated
with the voluntary retirement incentive program in addition to pension settlement charges in the fourth quarter 2019 related to employee retirements. The
decrease in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in net actuarial amortization expense. Refer to Note 13 for additional details.

percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors,
including measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit, and geographical income
mix offset by the impact from the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary as further described in the Overview, 
Certain amounts adjusted

adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures) 
section and in Note 10. Additional factors that impacted the tax rates
between years were adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges.
3M currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2020 will be approximately 20 to 21 percent. The tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete
items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as
the geographic mix of income before taxes.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M
consolidated entities. The amount primarily relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s effective ownership is 75 percent.
Currency Effects:
3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased pre-tax income by $1 million in 2019 and decreased pre-tax income
by $42 million in 2018. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations
on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed
to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased pre-tax income
by approximately $201 million in 2019 and decreased pre-tax income by approximately $92 million in 2018. Refer to Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities.
PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEG
MENT
For a detailed discussion of the markets served and types of products offered by 3M’s business segments, see Item 1, Business Segments. Disclosures
relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the second quarter of 2019, to enable the Company to better serve global
customers and markets, the Company made the following changes to its business segments:
Realignment of the Company’s business segments from five to four
 
The Company realigned its former five business segments into four: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.
Existing divisions were largely realigned to this new structure. In addition, certain retail auto care product lines formerly in the Automotive Aftermarket
Division (now within the Safety and Industrial business segment) were moved to the Construction and Home Improvement Division (within the Consumer
business segment). Also, product lines relating to the refrigeration filtration business, formerly included in the Separation and Purification Sciences
Division (now within the Health Care business segment) were moved to Other Safety and Industrial (within the Safety and Industrial business segment). 3M
business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. Dual credit, which is based on which
business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country, was reduced as a result of the closer
alignment between customer account activity and their respective markets. The four business segments are as follows:
Safety and Industrial
: This segment includes businesses that serve the global industrial, electrical and safety markets. This business segment consists of
personal safety, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, closure and masking systems, electrical markets, automotive aftermarket, and roofing granules.
This segment also includes the Communication Markets Division (which was substantially sold in 2018) and the refrigeration filtration product lines
(within Other Safety and Industrial).
Transportation and Electronics:
 This segment includes businesses that serve global transportation and electronic original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
customers. This business segment consists of electronics (display materials and systems, electronic materials solutions), automotive and aerospace,
commercial solutions, advanced materials, and transportation safety.
Health Care
: This business segment serves the global healthcare industry and includes medical solutions, oral care, separation and purification sciences,
health information systems, drug delivery systems, and food safety.
Consumer
: This business serves global consumers and consists of home improvement, stationery and office supplies, home care, and consumer health care.
This segment also includes, within the Construction and Home Improvement Division, certain retail auto care product lines.
Table of Contents
31
In addition, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following
changes, effective in the first quarter of 2019, and other revisions impacting business segment reporting:
Continued alignment of customer account activity
●
As part of 3M’s regular customer-focus initiatives, the Company realigned certain customer account activity (“sales district”) to correlate with the
primary divisional product offerings in various countries and reduce complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. This
largely impacted the amount of dual credit certain business segments receive as a result of sales district attribution. 3M business segment reporting
measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment
provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country.
Creation of Closure and Masking Systems Division and Medical Solutions Division
●
3M created the Closure and Masking Systems Division, which combines the masking tape, packaging tape and personal care portfolios formerly
within Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division in the former Industrial business segment into a separate division also within the former Industrial
business segment. 3M created the Medical Solutions Division in the Health Care business segment, which combines the former Critical and Chronic
Care Division and Infection Prevention Division (which were also both within the Health Care business segment).
Additional actions impacting business segment reporting
●
The business associated with certain safety products sold through retail channels in the Asia Pacific region was realigned from the Personal Safety
Division within the former Safety and Graphics business segment to the Construction and Home Improvement Division within the Consumer
business segment. In addition, certain previously non-allocated costs related to manufacturing and technology of centrally managed material
resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated are now reflected as being allocated to the business segments.
Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business
segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.
Corporate and Unallocated:
In addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding
business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and
losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring
charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Corporate
and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the
Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to
fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $166 million in 2019 when compared to 2018. In 2018 and 2019, significant litigation-related
charges of $897 million and $762 million, respectively, were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In 2018 and 2019, operating expenses included $127
million (net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates) and $140 million, respectively, of the restructuring actions further discussed in Note 5. In the
third quarter, operating expenses were partially offset by a gain related to sales of certain properties. In addition, 3M’s defined benefit pension and
postretirement service-cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased year-on-year.
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1 billion in 2018 when compared to 2017. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, the
operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and Unallocated. In
addition, in 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, as discussed in
Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture. In the first quarter of 2018, the
Minnesota NRD resolution ($897 million), inclusive of

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AR
EA
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also
utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to
3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different
geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular
geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic
areas is provided in Note 19.
Refer to the “Overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.

involved approximately 5,500 positions in 2019), net of divestitures and other actions.
Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:
Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing
efficiency. In 2019, 69% of 3M’s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin
America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales
in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes.
Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA
TES
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, pension and postretirement obligations, goodwill and certain long-
lived assets, and uncertainty in income tax positions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting
estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.
Table of Contents

Legal Proceedings:
Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. 
The
Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard
Codification (ASC) 450, 
Contingencies
. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal
Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.
Pension and Postretirement Obligations:
The Company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations.
The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the
measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and
discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that
would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the
spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service
cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot
yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains
and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

Another significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets for the
primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected
performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis
for 2020 is 6.75%, a decrease from 7.00% in 2019. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are
calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for
the international pension plan is 4.70% for 2020, compared to 4.90% for 2019. Refer to Note 13 for information on how the 2019 rates were determined.
3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 in determining the fair value of plan assets within the Company’s pension and
postretirement benefit plans. While the Company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and
consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments
could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining
defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of
$425 million and a benefit of $68 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special
termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $357 million, down from $410 million
in 2018.
In 2020, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $458 million while non-service pension and
postretirement net benefit costs (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is
Table of Contents
39
anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $67 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $391 million,
an increase of approximately $34 million compared to 2019.
The table below summarizes the impact on 2020 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease
in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2019 net periodic benefit cost. The

Goodwill and Certain Long-Lived Assets:
The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain long-lived assets. Those include considerations made in the
valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the
recoverability and impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill.
Acquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets
In conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their
respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows,
associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. The fair value calculated for indefinite-
lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames
and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining
their fair value. As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price
allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized.
Assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill
As of December 31, 2019, net property, plant and equipment totaled $9.3 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $6.4 billion, of which $0.6
billion related to indefinite-lived tradenames. In addition, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. 
Long-lived assets
with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s
ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s
carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely
certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized
when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of
each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying
amount may be impaired.
 If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill
would be impaired.
Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of
time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and
assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened
or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Factors which could result in future
impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the
weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results.
Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2019, the $0.6 billion of indefinite-lived tradenames primarily relates to Capital Safety (acquired in 2015), whose tradenames ($520
million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating
the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to
estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated
royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2019, no
impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in
aggregate.
3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of
each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level
below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At
3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized
when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference.
The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry
groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long
history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and
declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also
uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.
Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on
different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each
scenario occurring.
As described in Note 19, effective in the second quarter of 2019, the Company realigned its former five business segments into four to enable the Company
to better serve global customers and markets. In addition, effective in the first quarter of 2019, 3M made business segment reporting changes to align its
businesses around markets and customers. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value
method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During both the first and second quarters of 2019, the Company completed its
assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The
discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2019 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at
that time.
Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2019, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.
 
As of October 1, 2019, 3M had
23 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 91 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of
the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial
Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.
3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M’s
businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised
of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them.
3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2020 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
Uncertainty in Income Tax Positions:
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of
jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of
disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The
Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to
Note 10 for additional
Table of Contents
41
information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the
Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these
amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period
when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM
ENTS
Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI
TY
The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company
to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital
deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be
supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for
cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund
dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities
for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs.
 
For those
international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S.
operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to
the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum
maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2019, there was approximately $150 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.
Total Debt:
The strength of 3M’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s
maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1
credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service and has an AA- credit rating with Standard & Poor’s; Standard & Poor’s placed 3M on
“CreditWatch Negative” in January 2020.
The Company’s total debt was $5.7 billion higher at December 31, 2019 when compared to December 31, 2018. Increases in debt related to the first quarter
and third quarter 2019 issuances of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes and $3.25 billion of other registered notes, respectively, in addition to the 69 billion
Japanese Yen (approximately $632 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding from the 80 billion Japanese Yen credit facility established
in September 2019 and the 150 million Euro (approximately $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding credit facility established in
November 2019. Total debt also increased as a result of debt assumed from the October 2019 Acelity Inc. acquisition that was not settled at close as
discussed below. These increases were partially offset by the June 2019 repayment of $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term
notes that matured in addition to lower commercial paper outstanding. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash
Flows from Financing Activities” section.
In conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity Inc. of the debt assumed, 3M did not immediately settle at close $0.5 billion of notes and,
instead, satisfied and discharged those notes via an in-substance defeasance. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London
InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. The Company is in the process of reviewing its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments and
commercial contracts that utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. 3M will continue its impact assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the
transition period.

Effective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate
amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in
connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time)
of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous
aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.
As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019
and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt).
Additionally, the August 2019 debt was issued under the WKSI shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F). Information
with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.
In November 2019, 3M amended and restated its existing $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021 to a $3.0 billion five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to
$1.0 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility expiring
in November 2020. The 364-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into
term loans with a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December 31, 2019. Under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion
credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is
calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on
all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2019, this ratio was approximately 17 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
Apart from the committed credit facilities described above, in September 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in July 2020 in the amount of 80
billion Japanese Yen. At December 31, 2019, 69 billion Japanese Yen, or approximately $632 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates, was drawn and
outstanding. In November 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in November 2020 in the amount of 150 million Euros. At December 31, 2019,
150 million Euros, or $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates, was drawn and outstanding. The Company also had an additional $268 million in
stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019. These instruments are utilized in connection with
normal business activities.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:
At December 31, 2019, 3M had $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.4 billion was held by the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $100 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other
high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2018, 3M had $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which
approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $160 million was held by the United States. Specifics
concerning marketable securities investments are provided in Note 11.
Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):
Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines
net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities.

Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs.
Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by
other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors
as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.
Working capital decreased $2,716 million compared with December 31, 2018. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $738 million,
driven by reductions in cash and cash equivalents. Working capital decreases also relate to decreases in accounts receivable and in inventories (discussed
further below). Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1,978 million, primarily due to increases the current portion of long-term
debt due to upcoming maturities in 2020, accruals related to respirator mask/asbestos and other environmental liabilities, net of related subsequent
payments (refer to Note 16 for additional details on these accruals), in addition to the current portion of operating lease liabilities due to the adoption of
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, 
Leases 
(refer to Note 17 for additional details on leases).
Accounts receivable decreased $229 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower year-on-year sales in addition to continued focus on
improving cash flows, partially offset by the receivables acquired from the M*Modal and Acelity Inc. acquisitions. Inventory decreased $232 million from
December 31, 2018 as a result of the Company’s commitment to improve its response to slowing growth conditions in several key end markets and channel
inventory adjustments by customers partially offset by inventory from the Acelity Inc. acquisition.

Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a
substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average
invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is
provided in the below table.
In 2019, ROIC of 17.5 percent was lower than 2018. The decrease in 2019 when compared to 2018 was driven by lower net income from the 2019 impact
of significant litigation-related charges in addition to the charge from the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuela subsidiary. ROIC was also
negatively impacted by the increase in cash and cash equivalents in anticipation of the funding of the acquisition of Acelity.
In 2018, ROIC of 22.2 percent was higher than 2017. The increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was negatively impacted by the measurement period
adjustments taken in 2018 to the expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the impact from the resolution of the Minnesota
natural resource damages (NRD) resolution, and the impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions
related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture, which combined reduced ROIC by 2 percentage points in 2018.

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items
can significantly impact cash flows.
In 2019, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $631 million compared to the same period last year, with this increase primarily due to lower
year-on-year significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments. Additional factors that increased operating cash flows were
decreases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by
$598 million in 2019, compared to the working capital decreases of $406 million in 2018. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided
earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.
In 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $199 million compared to the same period last year, with the increase primarily made up of
higher net income and lower year-on-year pension and postretirement contributions. The increase was partially offset primarily due to the significant
litigation-related charges from the previously disclosed resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD) in the first quarter of 2018 and year-
on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The
combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital
increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.

Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing
efficiency. The Company expects 2020 capital spending to be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.
3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating
pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to
capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as
information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.
Refer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic
alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2019 primarily includes the purchase of M*Modal
and Acelity Inc. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2019 primarily relate to the sale of 3M’s gas and flame detection business and the sale of certain oral
care technology comprising a business.
Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily
attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.
Purchases of marketable securities and investments include the purchase of a $0.5 billion of held-to-maturity treasury security (further discussed in Note 11)
that was transferred to a trust as part of the in-substance defeasance of a portion of the debt assumed as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Acelity Inc.
Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit
insurance, plus investments in equity securities.

respectively, 69 billion Japanese Yen (approximately $632 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding from the 80 billion Japanese Yen
credit facility established in September 2019, 150 million Euro (approximately $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding credit
facility established in November 2019, and $0.5 billion of debt assumed and not yet repaid as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Acelity
Inc. Repayment of debt primarily consists of the June 2019 repayment of $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that had
matured, in addition to debt assumed and subsequently repaid as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of M*Modal and Acelity Inc. as discussed in Note
3. Outstanding commercial paper was $150 million at December 31, 2019, as compared to $435 million at December 31, 2018. Net commercial paper
issuances, repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s
primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt
issuances.
2018 Debt Activity:
The Company’s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to the third
quarter 2018 issuance of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes, which was partially offset by the $450 million third quarter repayment and 500 million Euro
fourth quarter repayment of maturing medium-term notes, the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign
currency effects, and lower year on year commercial paper balance. Outstanding commercial paper decreased $310 million from December 31, 2017 to
December 31, 2018. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-
term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer
to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt issuances.
Repurchases of Common Stock:
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In
November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program
authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2019, the Company purchased $1.4
billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $4.9 billion and $2.1 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company expects full-year 2020 gross
share repurchases to be approximately $1.0 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5.
The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.
Dividends Paid to Shareholders:
Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $3.316 billion ($5.76 per share) in 2019, $3.193 billion ($5.44 per share) in 2018, and $2.803 billion $4.70 per
share) in 2017. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2020, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2020 dividend of $1.47 per share, an
increase of 2 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.88 per share and marked the 62
nd
 consecutive year of dividend increases.
Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to
or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):
Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be
considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used
by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It
should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as
free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as
they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to

generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash
flow and free cash flow conversion for 2019, 2018 and 2017.
In 2019, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $762 million pre-tax charge related to the significant litigation-related charges, the $162 million
pre-tax impact from the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary, and the $112 million pre-tax divestiture gain from the gas and flame
detection business.
In 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from
the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax charge related to the significant litigation-related charges from the previously disclosed resolution of
the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381 million pre-tax gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring
actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture.
Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow. Refer to the
preceding “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” section for discussion on capital spending for property, plant and equipment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section
entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 16 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major
customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M
personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s maximum exposure under these
indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.

Long-term debt payments due in 2020 include floating rate notes totaling $149 million as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily
related to the TCJA’s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. See Note 10 for additional details.
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company.
Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service
agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase
obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure
availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional
purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s
expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for
which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment.
For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of
the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is
not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the
long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $961 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details. Additionally, included within the caption entitled
“Unconditional purchase obligations and other” are operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced, which as of December 31, 2019, totaled
approximately $23 million. These commitments pertain to 3M’s right of use buildings.
As discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019 and Company
contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are
not included in the preceding table.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMEN
TS
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and
floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and
Table of Contents
50
floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through
negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk,
commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.
Item 7A. 
Quantitative
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
In the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest
rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Senior management
provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides
guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk
analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and
forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to
credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The
Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.
Foreign Exchange Rates Risk:
Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations
in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in
foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the
occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the
forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to
offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing
transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging
instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s
foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The
dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.7
billion at December 31, 2019. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the Company had 4.1 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency
denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the “Net Investment
Hedges” section.
Interest Rates Risk:
The Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense
using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges.
Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by
reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional
amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2019 was $1.1 billion. Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note
12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company’s
long-term debt.
Table of Contents
51
Commodity Prices Risk:
The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. The related
mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in
the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation
and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals. These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to
which they were outstanding at December 31, 2019 was not material.
Value At Risk:
The value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A
Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and
underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2019. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time
horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to three currencies, and commodity prices related to five
commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge
transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse
and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.

An analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result
in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $70 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-
tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities,
primarily electricity and natural gas.

Management’s Responsibility
 for Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information included in this report. The financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Where necessary, the financial statements reflect estimates
based on management’s judgment.
Management has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its subsidiaries. This system and its
established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records
properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly
prepared and fairly presented. The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is supported by widely communicated written policies,
including business conduct policies, which are designed to require all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs.
Internal auditors continually review the accounting and control system.

Management’s Report
 on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management conducted an
assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s
 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 excluded M*Modal and Acelity, which were acquired by the Company in February 2019
 
and October 2019, respectively. The total assets and total net sales of M*Modal and Acelity collectively represent 2 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of
 
the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of  December 31, 2019. Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of
 
internal control over financial reporting during the year of acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities
 
and Exchange Commission. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s internal control over financial
 
reporting is effective.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.

Report
 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 3M Company
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 3M Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
 
We also have audited the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued
 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
  
In our opinion, the consolidated
 
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019
 
in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
 
December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated
Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
 
Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated
 
financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated
 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
  
Our audits of the consolidated
 
financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
 
financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
 
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
 
financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded M*Modal and Acelity Inc. from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business
combinations during 2019. We have also excluded M*Modal and Acelity Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. M*Modal and
Acelity Inc. are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total net sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control
over financial reporting collectively represent 2
Table of Contents
54
percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Legal Proceedings Contingencies
As described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, management records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can
reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, management
records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Management either discloses the amount of a
possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Management discloses
significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management believes there is at
least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to legal proceedings contingencies is a critical audit matter are there
was significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each
claim, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the
liabilities and disclosures associated with legal proceedings.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the liability related to legal
proceedings, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial
statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal
counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and
reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s disclosures related to legal proceedings.

Valuation of Acelity Inc. Intangible Assets
As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Acelity Inc. resulting in net assets acquired of
approximately $4.3 billion, including $3.6 billion of intangible assets. Management disclosed that the fair value of intangible assets acquired involved the
use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life
cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. As disclosed by management, the allocation of purchase consideration related to Acelity Inc. is
considered preliminary with provisional amounts.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of Acelity Inc. intangible assets is a critical audit
 
matter are there was significant auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of intangible assets
 
acquired due to the significant amount of judgment by management when developing the estimate; significant audit effort was  required in evaluating the
 
significant assumptions relating to the estimate, such as the projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life
 
cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates; and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
 
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over
 
management’s valuation of the intangible assets and controls over development of the assumptions related to the valuation of the intangible assets,
 
including projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates.
  
These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of intangible
 
assets. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of significant assumptions,
 
including the projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention
 
rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of the projected cash flows, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates involved considering economic
 
and industry factors and the past performance of the acquired businesses.  The discount rates were evaluated by considering the cost of capital of
 
comparable businesses and other industry factors.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of management’s
 
valuation methods and certain significant assumptions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1. Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation:
 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All applicable subsidiaries are
consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless
the context indicates otherwise.
Basis of presentation:
 Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
Foreign currency translation:
 Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States with the exception of 3M’s
subsidiaries in Argentina, the economy of which was considered highly inflationary beginning in 2018, and accordingly the financial statements of these
subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are
translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in
effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders’ equity.
3M had a consolidating subsidiary in Venezuela, the financial statements of which were remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent
because Venezuela’s economic environment is considered highly inflationary. The operating income of this subsidiary was immaterial as a percent of 3M’s
consolidated operating income for the periods presented. In light of circumstances, including the country’s unstable environment and heightened unrest
leading to sustained lack of demand, and expectation that these circumstances will continue for the foreseeable future, during May 2019, 3M concluded it
no longer met the criteria of control in order to continue consolidating its Venezuelan operations. As a result, as of
 
May 31, 2019, the Company began
reflecting its interest in the Venezuelan subsidiary as an equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value. This resulted in a pre-tax
charge of $
162
 million within other expense (income) in the second quarter of 2019. The charge primarily relates to $
144
 million of foreign currency
translation losses associated with foreign currency movements before Venezuela was accounted for as a highly inflationary economy and pension elements
previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with write-down of intercompany receivable and investment balances associated with
this subsidiary. Beginning May 31, 2019, 3M’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations no longer include the Venezuelan entity’s
operations other than an immaterial equity investment and associated loss or income thereon largely only to the extent, if any, that 3M provides support or
materials and receives funding or dividends.
Use of estimates:
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents:
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.
Marketable securities:
 Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in,
first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M
reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320
, Investments-Debt and
Equity Securities
, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”. A temporary impairment charge results
in an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not
reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate
between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the
underlying collateral, as well as other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or
“other-than-temporary” impairment.
Investments:
 All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with
changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not
Table of Contents
62
have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly
transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7.
Other assets: 
Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies,
medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term
assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash
surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life
insurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and
investments,” respectively.
Inventories:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Property, plant and equipment:
 Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from 
ten
 to 
forty years
, with the majority in the range of 
twenty
 to 
forty years
. The
estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from 
three
 to 
fifteen years
, with the majority in the range of 
five
 to 
ten years
. Fully
depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts
until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal,
is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of
an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the
impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted
cash flow analysis.
Conditional asset retirement obligations: 
A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations
exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the
liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related
assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $
137
 million and $
122
 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Goodwill: 
Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between
annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done
at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be
combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for
impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its estimated fair
value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the
reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option
to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is
commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.
Intangible assets: 
Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an
independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from 
four
 to 
twenty years
 on a systematic and rational basis
(generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between 
twelve
to 
nineteen years
, patents largely between 
six
 to 
seventeen years
, other technology-based largely between 
six
 to 
fifteen years
, definite lived tradenames
largely between 
six
 and 
twenty years
, and other intangibles largely between 
five
 to 
thirteen years
. Intangible assets are removed from their respective gross
asset and accumulated

amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the
Company’s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within “Research,
development and related expenses.”
Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group)
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or
asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of
the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually,
and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be
impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.
Restructuring actions:
 Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs,
and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon
distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts
are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain
circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were
communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other
charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the
counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset
impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.
Revenue (sales) recognition:
 The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material
concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M’s customer arrangements contain a single
performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in
the contracts and, therefore, not distinct.
 
However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-
licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and
non-standard terms and conditions.
The Company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers.
Revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company’s customer arrangements, control transfers to
customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of
goods/services transfers to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the
benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).
Revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable
consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates,
trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely
amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes.
The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across
businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.
There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an
expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal
course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other
excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.

For substantially all arrangements recognized over time, the Company applies the “right to invoice” practical expedient. As a result, 3M recognizes revenue
at the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the
Company’s performance completed to date.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M’s best
estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
The Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous
periods.
The Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years
presented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any
year presented.
3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:
●
Exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of 
one year
 or less.
●
Practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would
have been 
one year
 or less.
●
Portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration.
●
“Right to invoice” practical expedient based on 3M’s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer
of 3M’s performance completed to date.
●
Election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.
●
Sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required
remaining performance obligations disclosure
The Company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in light of the guidance of ASC 842, 
Leases
. The Company recognizes rental
revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally,
retail price for non-contracted customers. The leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as
operating leases.
Accounts receivable and allowances: 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains
allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the
best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. The Company determines the allowances
based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for
doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
Advertising and merchandising:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $
348
 million in 2019, $
396
 million in 2018 and
$
411
 million in 2017.
Research, development and related expenses:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $
1.911
 billion in 2019, $
1.821
 billion in 2018 and $
1.870
 billion in
2017. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $
1.253
 billion in 2019, $
1.253
 billion in 2018 and $
1.352
 billion in 2017. Related expenses primarily include
technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of
externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved
investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.
Internal-use software:
 The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use
software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of 
three
 to 
seven years
, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational
basis is more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component
Table of Contents
65
of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from
property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.
Environmental:
 Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably
estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies.
Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
Income taxes:
 The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company
had valuation allowances of $
158
 million and $
67
 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax
positions based on the rules under ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. As described in the “New Accounting Pronouncements” section, 3M adopted ASU No. 2018-
02, 
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
. The Company’s accounting policy for income taxes has been
updated to indicate the uses of the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Earnings per share:
 The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M
common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these
stock-based compensation plans during the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M
common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (
8.9
 million average options for 2019, 
2.9
 million average options for 2018, and
0.8
 million average options for 2017). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

Stock-based compensation: 
The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable
accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over
the period in which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the
award’s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating
an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial
statements. These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash
flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is
subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises.
Comprehensive income:
 Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and
postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on
Table of Contents
66
available-for-sale debt securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing
income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.
Derivatives and hedging activities:
 All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are recorded on the balance sheet at
fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks
generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting
are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to
exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for
hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement
of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.
Credit risk:
 The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors
its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as
counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master
netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate
derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of
derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master
netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
Fair value measurements:
 3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a
hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring
that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability
developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the
circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement.
Acquisitions: 
The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
. This standard requires the acquiring
entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date
fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard
prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent
consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.
 
In addition to business
combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify
for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.

Leases:
 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the
economic benefits of the underlying asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3M determines certain service agreements that
contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. Examples of
such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing agreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase
agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.
After adoption of ASU 2016-02 and related standards, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the
present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3M’s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the
rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the
economic environment of the applicable country or region.
As a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted
annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M’s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Certain leases include 
one
 or 
more
 options to renew, with terms that can 
extend
 the 
lease
 
term
 up to 
five years
. 3M includes options to renew the lease as
part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair
value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.
For the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying
asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used
beyond their noncancelable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, and payments for non-components such as sales tax.
Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases
, and in July 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-10 and
2018-11 and in December 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-20 and in March 2019, issued ASU No. 2019-01, which amended the standard, replacing existing
lease accounting guidance. The new standard introduced a lessee model that requires entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but
recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The ASU did not make fundamental changes to previous lessor
accounting. However, it modified what qualifies as a sales-type and direct financing lease and related accounting and aligned a number of the underlying
principles with those of the ASC 606 revenue standard, such as evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be
recognized. The guidance eliminated existing real estate-specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the
ASU was effective January 1, 2019. As amended, the ASU provided for retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method
by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods presented. 3M did not recast prior periods as it adopted this ASU. As a result of
adopting this ASU, 3M recorded approximately $
0.8
 billion of lease assets and 
lease
 liabilities related to its operating leases and a $
14
 million adjustment to
retained earnings related to transition upon this ASU’s adoption.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, 
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
, which revises guidance for the accounting for
credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, and in November 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-19 and in April 2019, issued ASU No. 2019-04 and in
May 2019, issued ASU No. 2019-05, and in November 2019, issued ASU No. 2019-11, which amended the standard. The new standard introduces an
approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-
sale debt securities. The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in
leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU amends the current other-than-temporary
impairment model. For such securities with unrealized losses, entities will still consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and
therefore recognized as a reduction in income. However, rather than also reflecting that
Table of Contents
68
credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that AFS debt security, the ASU requires that credit losses be reflected as an
allowance. As a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in previous allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income.
For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. Based on the conducted analyses and due
to the nature and extent of 3M’s financial instruments in scope of this ASU (primarily accounts receivable) and the historical, current and expected credit
quality of its customers, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, 
Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities 
and in October 2018, issued ASU No.
2018-16, which amended the standard. The ASU amends existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow
companies to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. Existing standards contain certain requirements for an instrument to
qualify for hedge accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge effectiveness. While an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge
relationship is highly effective would still be required, the new ASU permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead of a quantitative
test and expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. The ASU also simplifies related accounting by eliminating the requirement
to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. Instead, for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges, the entire change in fair value
(including the amount attributable to ineffectiveness) will be recorded within other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same income
statement line that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. For fair value hedges, generally, the
entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument would also be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The new standard also
simplifies the accounting for fair value hedges of interest rate risks and expands an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. In
addition, the guidance also eases certain documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, and requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge-related information. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2019, with
a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the adoption date.
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, 
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
, which
permits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising
from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification
must consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as
well as the entity’s policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. The ASU may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period
of adoption. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2019 and resulted in a reclassification between retained earnings and AOCI. As a result of adopting
this ASU, the Company increased retained earnings by approximately $
0.9
 billion, with an offsetting increase to 
accumulated
 other comprehensive loss for
the same amount.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, 
Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That
Is a Service Contract
, which aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement (i.e.
hosting arrangement) with the guidance on capitalizing costs in ASC 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. The ASU permits either a prospective or retrospective
transition approach. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020 and the Company plans on prospective adoption. While the Company utilized
limited cloud-computing services where significant implementation costs were incurred for the periods presented, 3M will apply this ASU to its expected
expanded use of applicable services.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, 
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). 
This ASU simplifies the accounting for
income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain existing exceptions related to the general approach in ASC 740 relating to franchise taxes,
reducing complexity in the interim-period accounting for year-to-date loss limitations and changes in tax laws, and clarifying the accounting for transactions
outside of business combination that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The transition requirements are primarily prospective and the effective
date for 3M is January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. As 3M does not have material activity associated with items such as franchise taxes or the
types of transactions described above, does not typically have entities subject to relevant loss limitations and is not currently addressing
Table of Contents
69
enacted tax law changes for which this ASU applies, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, 
Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Investments—Equity Securities
, 
Topic 323,
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging
.
 
This ASU clarifies that when accounting for certain equity
securities, a Company should consider observable transactions before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting for the purposes of
applying the measurement alternative. Further, this ASU notes when determining the accounting for certain derivatives, a Company should not consider if
the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option. The transition requirements are prospective and the effective
date for 3M is January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. As 3M does not currently have a material amount of equity securities and equity method
investments or relevant derivatives, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition,
but will apply such guidance, where applicable, to future circumstances.
NOTE 2. Revenue
The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 and related standards (collectively, ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
), on January 1, 2018 using
the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative net impact of adopting ASC 606, the January 1,
2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $
2
 million, primarily relating to the accelerated recognition for software installation service
and training revenue. This cumulative impact reflects retrospective application of ASC 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
Further, the Company applied the practical expedient permitting the effect of all contract modifications that occurred before January 1, 2018 to be
aggregated in the transition accounting. The impact of applying ASC 606 as compared with previous guidance applied to revenues and costs was not
material for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Contract Balances:
Deferred revenue primarily relates to revenue that is recognized over time for 
one-year
 software license contracts. Refer to Note 7 for deferred revenue
balances at December 31, 2018 and 2019. Approximately $
600
 million of the December 31, 2018 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended
December 31, 2019, while approximately $
500
 million of the December 31, 2017 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31,
2018.

NOTE 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions:
3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets
and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired
businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses.
2019 acquisitions:
In February 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of all of the ownership interests of the technology business of M*Modal for $
0.7
 billion of cash, net of cash
acquired, and assumption of $
0.3
 billion of M*Modal’s debt. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, M*Modal is a leading healthcare technology provider of
cloud-based, conversational artificial intelligence-powered systems that help physicians efficiently capture and improve the patient narrative. The allocation
of purchase consideration related to M*Modal was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net sales and operating loss (inclusive of transaction and
integration costs) of this business included in
Table of Contents
72
3M’s consolidated results of operations in 2019 were approximately $
300
 million and $
25
 million, respectively. M*Modal is reported within the
Company’s Health Care business.
In October 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of all of the ownership interests of Acelity Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries for consideration of $
4.5
 billion net
of cash acquired as shown in the table below, and assumption of $
2.3
 billion of debt (see also Note 12). Acelity is a leading global medical technology
company focused on advanced wound care and specialty surgical applications marketed under the KCI brand. The allocation of purchase consideration
related to Acelity Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries is considered preliminary with provisional amounts primarily related to intangible assets, working capital,
certain tax-related and contingent liability amounts. 3M expects to finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one-year measurement-period
following the acquisition. Net sales and operating loss (inclusive of transaction and integration costs) of this business included in 3M’s consolidated results
of operations in 2019 were approximately $
350
 million and $
45
 million, respectively. Acelity is reported within the Company’s Health Care business.
Proforma information related to these acquisitions has not been included as the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations was not
considered material. The following table shows the impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations related to the 2019
acquisitions and assigned finite-lived asset weighted average lives.

portfolio.
Divestitures:
3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among other items, factors relative to the

annual sales of approximately $
85
 million, consists of ballistic helmets, body armor, flat armor and related helmet-attachment products serving government

Accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a change in
reporting units or the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division.
As described in Note 19, effective in the second quarter of 2019, the Company realigned its former 
five
 business segments into 
four
 to enable the Company
to better serve global customers and markets. In addition, effective in the first quarter of 2019, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its
continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes,
the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. Goodwill balances reported above
reflect these business segment reporting changes in the earliest period presented. During the first and second quarters of 2019, the Company completed its
assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that 
no
 impairment existed. The
Company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019 for all reporting units and determined that 
no
 impairment existed.
In addition, the Company had 
no
 impairments of goodwill in 2018 or 2017.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal (approximately $
82
 million),
state (approximately $
79
 million), and international (approximately $
55
 million), with all amounts before limitation impacts and valuation allowances.
Federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 
one
 to 
10 years
, the state after 
one
 to 
11 years
, and the international after 
one year
 to an indefinite carryover
period. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has provided $
158
 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on
management’s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be realized.

Effective worldwide tax rate

%

%

%
The effective tax rate for 2019 was 
19.8
 percent, compared to 
23.4
 percent in 2018, a decrease of 
3.6
 percentage points, impacted by several factors.
Primary factors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2019 included prior year measurement period adjustments related to 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit (as described in Note 16), and geographical income mix. These decreases were partially offset by the
deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges.
The effective tax rate for 2018 was 
23.4
 percent, compared to 
35.5
 percent in 2017, a decrease of 
12.1
 percentage points, impacted by several factors.
Primary factors that decreased the Company’s effective tax rate included favorable aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) including the decrease in
the U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to transition tax and remeasurement of
deferred tax assets/liabilities, increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, and favorable adjustment to prior year uncertain tax provisions. These decreases
were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision, and lower
excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments.
The TCJA was enacted in December 2017, after which the 
SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a measurement period of
up to one year from the TCJA’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740.
 In connection with the enactment of the TCJA,
the Company recorded a net tax expense of $
762
 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and additional net charges of $
176
 million as measurement period
adjustments in 2018, which are comprised of both a transition tax in addition to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts.
The TCJA’s transition tax is payable over 
eight years
 beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, 3M reflected $
653
 million and
$
649
 million, respectively, in accrued income taxes – long-term portion and $
33
 million payable within one year associated with the transition tax.
The Company adopted ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, as described in Note 1,
on January 1, 2019. The purpose of this ASU was to allow a reclassification to retained earnings of one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated
other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of TCJA. The effect of this adoption resulted
in a reclassification between retained earnings and AOCI, which
Table of Contents
84
increased retained earnings by approximately $
0.9
 billion, with an offsetting increase to 
accumulated
 other comprehensive loss for the same amount.
The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2005 through 2015, but the years have not closed as the
Company is in the process of resolving issues identified during those examinations. The Company is under examination or in appeals for 2015 through
2018. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019, no
taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.
 
It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing
federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax
authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances
including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company expects approximately $
50
million of unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized within the next 12 months.
The Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:

The total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $
1,178
 million as of December 31, 2019, $
655
 million as of December 31,
2018, and $
526
 million as of December 31, 2017. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties,
and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated
statement of income on a gross basis approximately $
33
 million of expense, $
12
 million of expense, and $
20
 million of expense in 2019, 2018, and 2017,
respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At
December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $
102
 million and $
69
million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is
highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
As a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the following
countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: China (2019), Korea (2019), Switzerland
(2023), Singapore (2025), and Brazil (2028). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $
127
 million (
22
cents per diluted share) in 2019, $
227
 million (
38
 cents per diluted share) in 2018, and $
228
 million (
37
 cents per diluted share) in 2017.

The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $
14
 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019
which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large
portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested
indefinitely.

Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities
In connection with the in-substance debt defeasance of the Third Lien Notes described in Note 12, the Company purchased a $
0.5
 billion U.S. Treasury
security in the fourth quarter of 2019 that matures in the second quarter of 2020 and transferred it to a trust with irrevocable instructions to use the proceeds
from its maturity to satisfy the redemption of the Third Lien Notes in May 2020. This debt security is considered held-to-maturity due to the restrictions in
satisfying and discharging the Third Lien Notes, is carried at amortized cost, and is reflected in other current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet. At December 31, 2019, the difference between the amortized cost of the U.S. Treasury security and its fair value was not material.

Credit Facilities
In November 2019, 3M amended and restated its existing $
3.75
 billion 
five-year
 revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021 to a $
3.0
 billion 
five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to
$
1.0
 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $
4.0
 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $
1.25
 billion 
364-day
 credit facility expiring
in November 2020. The 
364-day
 credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into
term loans having a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December 31, 2019. Under both the $
3.0
 billion and $
1.25
 billion
credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 
3.0
 to 1. This is
calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the 
four
 consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on
all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2019, this ratio was approximately 
17
 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
Other Credit Facilities
Apart from the committed credit facilities described above, in September 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in July 2020 in the amount of 
80
billion Japanese Yen. At December 31, 2019, 
69
 billion Japanese Yen, or approximately $
632
 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates, was drawn and
outstanding. In November 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in November 2020 in the amount of 
150
 million Euros. At December 31, 2019,
150
 million Euros, or $
168
 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates, was drawn and outstanding.
Table of Contents
88
The Company also had an additional $
268
 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019. These
instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.

Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments
In June 2019, 3M repaid $
625
 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.
In 2019, 3M also assumed approximately $
2.6
 billion of debt in connection with the acquisitions of Acelity and M*Modal (See Note 3) of which $
2.1
billion was immediately redeemed or paid at close.
In November and August 2018, respectively, 3M repaid 
500
 million Euros and $
450
 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate medium-term
notes that matured.
In October 2017, 3M, via cash tender offers, repurchased $
305
 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $
110
 million of
its $
330
 million principal amount of 
6.375
% notes due 2028 and $
195
 million of its $
750
 million principal amount of 
5.70
% notes due 2037. The Company
recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of approximately $
96
 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense, the cash outflow for which
is recorded within other financing activities on the statement of cash flows. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount
paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses.
In June 2017, 3M repaid $
650
 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes that matured.

In-Substance Defeasance
In conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity (See Note 3), 3M assumed outstanding debt of the business, of which $
445
 million in principal
amount of third lien senior secured notes (Third Lien Notes) maturing in 2021 with a coupon rate of 
12.5
% was not immediately redeemed at closing.
Instead, at closing, 3M satisfied and discharged the Third Lien Notes via an in-substance defeasance, whereby 3M transferred held-to-maturity debt
securities to a trust with irrevocable instructions to redeem the Third Lien Notes on May 1, 2020. The trust assets are restricted from use in 3M’s operations
and may only be used for the redemption of the Third Lien Notes. These actions, however, do not represent a legal defeasance. Therefore, as of December
31, 2019, this debt is included in current portion of long-term debt and the related trust assets comprised of a held-to-maturity debt security are included in
other current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
Floating Rate Notes
At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging
from 
99
 percent to 
100
 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a 
forty-year
 $
60
 million
floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at
100
 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and
2041, holders have put options that commence 
ten years
 from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices
ranging from 
99
 percent to 
100
 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the
aforementioned floating rate notes.
NOTE 13. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In total, 3M has
over 
75
 defined benefit plans in 
28
 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participant’s years of service,
compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1,
2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while
employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by
government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is
combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.
The Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained
to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S.
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an
independent trustee.
The Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular
U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 
5
% of eligible compensation matched in
cash at rates of 
45
% or 
60
%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match
of 
100
% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 
5
% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of
3
% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections.
Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $
186
 million, $
173
 million and $
159
 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 3M
subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution
plans were $
96
 million, $
99
 million and $
88
 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In May 2019 (as part of the 2019 restructuring actions discussed in Note 5), the Company began offering a voluntary early retirement incentive program to
certain eligible participants of its U.S. pension plans who meet age and years of pension service requirements. The eligible participants who accepted the
offer and retired by July 1, 2019 received an enhanced pension benefit. Pension benefits were enhanced by adding 
one
 additional year of pension service
and 
one
 additional year of age for certain benefit calculations.
Table of Contents
90
Approximately 
800
 participants accepted the offer and retired before July 1, 2019. As a result, the Company incurred a $
35
 million charge related to these
 
special termination benefits in the second quarter of 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-operating $
32
 million settlement expense in its U.S. non-qualified pension plan. The charge is
related to lump sum payments made to employees at retirement. The settlement expense is an accelerated recognition of past actuarial losses.
In May 2019, 3M modified the 3M Retiree Life Insurance Plan postretirement benefit to close it to new participants effective August 1, 2019 (which results
in employees who retire on or after August 1, 2019 not being eligible to participate in the plan) and reducing the maximum life insurance and death benefit
to $
8,000
 for deaths on or after August 1, 2019. Due to these changes, the plan was re-measured in the second quarter of 2019, resulting in a decrease to the
accumulated projected benefit obligation liability of approximately $
150
 million and a related increase to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated
other comprehensive income in addition to an immaterial income statement benefit prospectively.
The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a
summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain
non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by
particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. The
obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $
40
 million as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018.

measurement date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was
$
17.125
 billion and $
15.033
 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation of the international pension plans

The Company provides eligible retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. The contributions
provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 
3
 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 
1.5
percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.
The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement
benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated
liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt
instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company
determined a discount rate of 
3.25
% for the U.S. pension plans and 
3.27
% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2019, which is a decrease
of 
1.11
 percentage points and 
1.14
 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2018. A decrease in the discount rate increases
the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the significant decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2019 resulted in an approximately $
2.0
 billion
higher PBO for the U.S. pension plans. For the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the
associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the
expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond
information. In countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate
corporate bond yields.
The Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs
are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-
specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit
obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 
7.00
% in 2019. Projected returns are
based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s 2020 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 
6.75
%. The expected return assumption is based on
the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The
2019 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 
23
% global equities, 
14
% private equities, 
47
% fixed-income
securities, and 
16
% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment
management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2019 was 
16.3
%. In 2018 the plan earned a rate of return of -
0.5
% and in 2017 earned a return of
12.4
%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 
10
 and 
25 years
 has been 
8.9
% and 
9.4
%, respectively. Return on assets
assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and
expected long-term rate of return assumptions.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company converted to the “Pri-2012 Aggregate Mortality Table” and updated the mortality improvement scales to the
Society of Actuaries Scale MP-2019. The December 31, 2019 update resulted in a small decrease to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations.
During 2019, the Company contributed $
207
 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $
3
 million to its postretirement plans. During 2018, the
Company contributed $
366
 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $
4
 million to its postretirement plans. In 2020, the Company expects to
contribute an amount in the range of $
100
 million to $
200
 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a
required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2020. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and
other factors.

Plan Asset Management
3M’s investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The primary goal of the trust funds is to
meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without
subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible
within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The
investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S.
pension liabilities.
Normally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to
external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not
considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these
levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies
or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
In order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target
strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some
investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have
been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will
normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary
of the plans. Approximately 
50
% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the
primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.
The fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:

Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
Fixed income includes derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts. Corporate debt includes bonds and
notes, asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and private placements. Swaps and derivative instruments are valued by the custodian
using closing market swap curves and market derived inputs. U.S. government and government agency bonds and notes are valued at the closing price
reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Corporate bonds and notes, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted
cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be
observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Private placements are valued by the custodian using recognized pricing services and sources. 
The private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of derivative instruments, growth equity and partnership interests. Derivative investments are written

International Pension Plans Assets
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below of asset categories is presented in
aggregate for over 
70
 defined benefit plans in 
25
 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local
regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The
Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans.
Each plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.

Equities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the
closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
 
Fixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate, (including mortgage backed and other debt) securities. Governments,
corporate bonds and notes and mortgage backed securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently
available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs,
such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.
 
Private equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.
 
Absolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other
alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive
if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps that are used to help manage risks.
 
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities
purchased and interest payable.
The balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans’ level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute
return asset class. The aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains increased this balance by $
17
 million in 2019 and decreased this balance by $
11
million in 2018.
NOTE 14. Derivatives
The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial
instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M’s
financial position and performance.
3M adopted ASU No. 2017-12, 
Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
 as of January 1, 2019. The disclosures contained within this
note have been updated to reflect the new guidance, except for prior period amounts presented, as the disclosure changes were adopted prospectively. For
derivative instruments that are designated in a cash flow or fair value hedging relationship, the impact of this accounting standard was to remove the
requirement to test for ineffectiveness. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, any gain or loss related to hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in current
earnings. For any net investment hedges entered into on or after January 1, 2019, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, including
the time value of the forward contract at the inception of the hedge, are recognized in earnings using an amortization approach over the life of the hedging
instrument on a straight-line basis. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded component and the amount amortized into earnings
during the period is recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income.
Additional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:
●
Impact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.
●
Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 15.
●
Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt are also described in Note 12.
Types of Derivatives/Hedging Instruments and Inclusion in Income/Other Comprehensive Income:
Cash Flow Hedges:
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other
comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction
Table of Contents
99
affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current
earnings.
Cash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts:
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge
against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The
settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during
which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted
transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for dedesignated
hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the
value of derivative instruments after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 
36
months
.
Cash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts:
 The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows
from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $
200
 million as a hedge against
interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. In 2017, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate
swaps with notional amounts of $
600
 million as hedges against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Prior to the
issuance of medium-term notes in October 2017, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within
accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
During 2018, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $
1.2
 billion as hedges
against interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. Concurrent with the issuance of the medium-term notes in September
2018, 3M terminated $
500
 million of these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial gain within accumulated other comprehensive
income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $
700
 million of notional amount in outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps as hedges against interest
rate volatility with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. During 2019, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate swaps with a
notional amount of $
743
 million. Concurrent with the issuance of the medium-term notes in February 2019 and the additional issuance of registered notes in
August 2019, 3M terminated all outstanding interest rate swaps related to forecasted issuances of debt. These terminations resulted in a net loss of $
143
million within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
The amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income into income.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a balance of $
31
 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging
instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $
112
 million (after-tax loss) related to the forward
starting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, 3M expects to
reclassify approximately $
42
 million and $
20
 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to earnings in 2020 and
2021, respectively, in addition to reclassifying approximately $
93
 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging losses to
earnings after 2021 (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).

Fair Value Hedges:
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
Fair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps:
 The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing
costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value
hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest
expense.
In November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 
600
 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating
interest rate swap on a notional amount of 
300
 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond obligation.
In June 2014, 3M issued $
950
 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap to convert $
600
 million of a $
625
 million note that was due in 2019, included in this issuance, to an interest rate based on a floating 
three
-month
LIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. This interest rate swap matured in conjunction with
the repayment of the $
625
 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium notes that matured in June 2019.
In August 2015, 3M issued $
1.5
 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into 
two
 interest rate
swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $
450
 million 
three-year
 fixed rate note
that matured in August 2018 at which time the associated interest rate swap also matured, and
Table of Contents
101
the second converted $
300
 million of a 
five-year
 fixed rate note that is due in 2020, included in this issuance, to an interest rate based on a floating 
three
-
month LIBOR index.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $
200
 million that converted the company’s fixed-
rate medium-term note due 2020 into a floating-rate note as a hedge of its exposure to changes in the fair value that is attributable to interest rate risk.
In September 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $
200
 million that converted a portion of the Company’s $
400
million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 into a floating rate note with an interest rate based on a 
three
-month LIBOR
index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk.

Net Investment Hedges:
The Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward contracts) instruments to hedge
portions of the Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign exchange risk. For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges
of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates
are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in
earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially
complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is
dedesignated from a net investment hedge relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes
are recorded in earnings through their maturity date.
3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by time period
depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or are newly issued and
designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange risk coverage.
Table of Contents
102
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company dedesignated 
300
 million Euros of foreign currency denominated debt from a former net investment hedge
relationship.
At December 31, 2019, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was approximately 
200
 million
Euros, along with a principal amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 
4.1
 billion Euros. The maturity dates of
these derivative and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2020 to 2031.
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative and nonderivative
instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows. There were 
no
 reclassifications of the effective portion of net investment hedges out of
accumulated other comprehensive income into income for the periods presented in the table below.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were designated in
cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the Cash Flow Hedges section above). In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts to
offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements) and enters into commodity
price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals. These derivative instruments are not
designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings. The Company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Credit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments:
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and
forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to
credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M
enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement
may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions.
As of December 31, 2019, 3M has International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 
17
 applicable banks and financial institutions
which contain netting provisions. In addition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty’s parent guarantee,
Table of Contents
105
3M also has associated credit support agreements in place with 
16
 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the
circumstances under which either party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds
specified thresholds or if a counterparty’s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate nonperformance
by any of these counterparties.
3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when
derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide
information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in
the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the
Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the
transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation. As of the applicable dates presented below, no cash
collateral had been received or pledged related to these derivative instruments.

Foreign Currency Effects
3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, increased pre-tax income by approximately $
201
 million in
2019 and decreased pre-tax income by approximately $
92
 million in 2018. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative
instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.

NOTE 15. Fair Value Measurements
3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
and nonrecurring basis. Refer to Note 1 for additional details.
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:
For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain
derivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs
and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with
respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2019
and 2018.
3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Available-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:
Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities.
Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and
other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M
classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2.
Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 11.
Available-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:
3M holds municipal securities with certain cities in the United States as of December 31, 2019. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method
utilized includes referencing the carrying value of the corresponding finance lease obligation as adjusted for additional issuances when 3M sells its assets to
the municipality and decreases in the form of bond amortization payments, and as such will be classified as level 3 securities separately. Refer to Note 9 for
additional discussion of the non-cash nature of these securities.
Investments:
Investments include equity securities that are traded in an active market. Closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and are
representative of fair value. 3M classifies these securities as Level 1. Investments are included within other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet.
Derivative instruments:
The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are required to be recorded at fair value. The
Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps,
and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to
hedge 3M’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked
to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.
3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-
currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include
foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their
basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest
rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash
flows model.

In addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). Refer to
Note 13.
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis:
Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to long-lived asset impairments and adjustment
in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes is used. During
2017, the Company recognized approximately $
61
 million in long-lived asset impairments within its Safety and Industrial and Transportation and
Electronics business segments, with the complete carrying amount of such assets written off and included in operating income results. There were 
no
material long-lived asset impairments for 2018 and 2019. There were no material adjustments to equity securities using the measurement alternative for
2019.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, accounts receivable,
certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held-to-maturity debt
securities, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in
the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are derived
all or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party’s internal records. Information with respect to the carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:

The fair values reflected above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount of long-term
debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of certain
fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Company’s net investment in its European subsidiaries. A number of
3M’s fixed-rate bonds were trading at a premium at December 31, 2019 and 2018 due to the lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads compared to
issuance levels.

NOTE 16. Commitments and Contingencies
Unconditional Purchase Obligations:
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-cancelable, or
cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment (for those contracts with terms in
excess of one year) as of December 31, 2019, at $
983
 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows: 2020 ($
306
 million), 2021 ($
278
 million), 2022
($
156
 million), 2023 ($
184
 million), 2024 ($
42
 million) and after 2024 ($
17
 million). Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which
3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or
services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but
represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no
unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to
purchases.
Warranties/Guarantees:
3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at
approximately $
51
 million at December 31, 2019, and $
48
 million at December 31, 2018. Further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as
the Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans
with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.
Related Party Activity:
3M does not have any material related party activity.
Legal Proceedings:
The Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings
worldwide. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings include, but are not limited to, products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly
manufactured and sold), intellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal False Claims Act, securities, and state and federal environmental laws. Unless
otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to time, the Company also receives subpoenas or
requests for information from various government agencies. The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough
and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such subpoenas
and requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and
others, as well as to settlements. The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. Any determination that the
Company’s operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or
criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment or injunctive relief.
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings
Many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise
subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily
on estimates and assumptions. When making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the
requirements of ASC 450, 
Contingencies
, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the
loss and when liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial
statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a
possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses
significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at
least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
Table of Contents
110
Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may
not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. Many of the matters described are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate
amount of damages. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. A future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or
increase in accruals for one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, the
Company currently believes that the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings or future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position of the Company. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and
associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable.
Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company
could change in the future.
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings
The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law
interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an
amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial
statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those
insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable,
or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to
recover for the expense incurred.
The following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated
insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation
As of December 31, 2019, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to
represent approximately 
1,727
 individual claimants, compared to approximately 
2,320
 individual claimants with actions pending at December 31, 2018.
The vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s mask and
respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal
mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and
claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products
previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company
premises.
The Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects
that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims
alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than
in the past. Over the past 
twenty
 plus years, the Company has prevailed in 
fourteen
 of the 
fifteen
 cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018
described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in 
two
 lawsuits – 
one
 in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts
state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April
2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect 
two
 coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory
damages of approximately $
2
 million and punitive damages totaling $
63
 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company
appealed. During March and April 2019, the Company agreed in principle to settle a substantial majority of the coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and
West Virginia for $
340
 million, including the jury verdict in April 2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above. That settlement has now been completed,
and the appeal has been dismissed.

111
The Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended
manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if
significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of
persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of
unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it
experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.
As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and 
two
 other
manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended
complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker’s
compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive
from the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in March 2011. In October 2019, the court granted the State’s
motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim. In January 2020, the manufacturers filed a petition with the West Virginia Supreme Court, challenging the
trial court’s rulings. 
No
 liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In
addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West
Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case, and the assertions of claims against 
two
 other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may
turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical
claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the
proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other
occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve
pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the “Claims Data”). As part of its comprehensive legal
review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and
costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses these estimates to
develop its best estimate of probable liability.
Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes
in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company’s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of
defending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims,
and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.
As a result of the March and April 2019 settlements-in-principle of the coal mine dust lawsuits mentioned above, the Company’s assessment of other
current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits (including the costs to resolve all current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West
Virginia), its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including
mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2019 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $
337
million, of which $
313
 million pre-tax was accrued in the first quarter of 2019. In 2019, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and
settlements of $
402
 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had an accrual for respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $
608
 million. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of probable loss and reflects an
estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper
end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting
the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert
claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability
may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in
estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.
Table of Contents
112
As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $
4
 million. The
Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company
will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies
On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”). Aearo
manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection
products.
As of December 31, 2019, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical Corporation,
Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in
numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for
alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by
other defendants or generally in the workplace.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $
50
 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to
current and future Aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of Aearo’s probable loss and
reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against Aearo approaching the year 2050. The accrual was increased by $
22
 million from
the year-end 2018, reflecting the Company’s assessment of pending and expected lawsuits, its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost
of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared
in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the
“Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety”
brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of
the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as
Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $
100,000
, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims
involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a
particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged
use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo’s potential
liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after
January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-
July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to
meet its obligations in these matters.
Developments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in
the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these
claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure
applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor
Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which
Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of
Aearo’s share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these
liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.
Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future
claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities, the Company
cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.

Environmental Matters and Litigation
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic
substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private
parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for
capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property
damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations,
defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to
satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates,
policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.
Under certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA) and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of
environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in
the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the section entitled “
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” 
that
follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.
Environmental Matters
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including
perfluorooctanoate (“PFOA”), perfluorooctane sulfonate (“PFOS”), perfluorohexane sulfonate (“PFHxS”), or other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(collectively “PFAS”). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA,
PFOS, PFHxS, and their pre-cursor compounds. The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately
two years
 of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. The Company
continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane
sulfonate (“PFBS”). These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and
fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification
processes associated with the Company’s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review,
control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3M’s current fluorochemical manufacturing
processes, products, and waste streams.
Regulatory activities concerning PFAS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities
include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As the database of studies of both PFOA
and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. In February 2014, the
EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in August 2014. In May
2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 
70
 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the provisional levels established
by the EPA in 2009 of 
400
 ppt for PFOA and 
200
 ppt for PFOS). Where PFOA and PFOS are found together, EPA recommends that the concentrations be
added together, and the lifetime health advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is also 
70
 ppt. Lifetime health advisories, which are non-enforceable and
non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the
specified exposure duration. To collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA published on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated
substances, including 
six
 PFAS chemicals, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent
of their occurrence. Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 
4,920
 public water supplies nationwide. Based on the 2016 lifetime health
advisory, 
13
 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 
46
 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from the July 2016 EPA summary). A technical
advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 
65
 public water supplies had exceeded the
combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on 
one
 or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect
current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public water supplies.

The Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate its historic disposal of PFAS-containing
waste associated with manufacturing operations at its Decatur, Alabama; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported,
the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to remediate the
presence of PFAS in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. For approximately 
20 years
 (1978-1998), pursuant to a permit
issued by ADEM, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge, which contained PFAS, in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review
of the available options to address the presence of PFAS in the soil, ADEM agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the
former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan
continues.
The Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007
Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington
County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the
Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or
alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (“HBV”) or Health Risk Limit (“HRL”) (i.e., the amount of a
chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS
for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS at these sites that are
not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During
2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and
Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility.
During the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M
commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved
by the MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. Remediation
continued at the Cottage Grove site during 2019.
In August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova,
Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.
In May 2017, the MDH issued new HBVs for PFOS and PFOA. The new HBVs are 
35
 ppt for PFOA and 
27
 ppt for PFOS. In connection with its
announcement the MDH stated that “Drinking water with PFOA and PFOS, even at the levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate
health risk. These values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most
vulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.” In December 2017, the MDH issued a new HBV for
perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) of 
2
 parts per billion (ppb). In February 2018, the MDH published reports finding no unusual rates of certain cancers or
adverse birth outcomes (low birth rates or premature births) among residents of Washington and Dakota Counties in Minnesota. In April 2019, the MDH
issued a new HBV for PFOS of 
15
 ppt and a new HBV for PFHxS of 
47
 ppt.
In May 2018, the EPA announced a four-step PFAS action plan, which includes evaluating the need to set Safe Drinking Water Act maximum contaminant
levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS and beginning the steps necessary to designate PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. In
November 2018, the EPA asked for public comment on draft toxicity assessments for 
two
 PFAS compounds, including PFBS. In February 2019, the EPA
issued a PFAS Action Plan that outlines short- and long-term actions the EPA is taking to address PFAS – actions that include developing a national
drinking water determination for PFOA and PFOS, strengthening enforcement authorities and evaluating cleanup approaches, nationwide drinking water
monitoring for PFAS, expanding scientific knowledge for understanding and managing risk from PFAS, and developing consistent risk communication
tools for communicating with other agencies and the public. With respect to groundwater contaminated with PFOA and PFOS, the EPA issued interim
recommendations in December 2019, providing guidance for screening levels and preliminary remediation goals for groundwater that is a current or
potential drinking water source, to inform final clean-up levels of contaminated sites.
The U.S.
 
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within the Department of Health and Human Services released a draft Toxicological
Profile for PFAS for public review and comment in June 2018. In the draft report, ATSDR proposed draft minimal risk levels (MRLs) for PFOS, PFOA
and several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a
Table of Contents
115
hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are not
intended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other agencies. In August 2018, 3M submitted comments on the ATSDR proposal, noting that
there are major shortcomings with the current draft, especially with the MRLs, and that the ATSDR’s profile must reflect the best science and full weight of
evidence known about these chemicals.
Several state legislatures and state agencies have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards, groundwater values or drinking water
values for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS, and 3M has submitted various responsive comments. In September 2019, 3M and several other parties filed a
lawsuit in New Hampshire state court to enjoin new PFAS regulations in New Hampshire. In November 2019, the court issued a preliminary injunction
preventing the regulations from being enforced. New Hampshire has made a motion to appeal that decision with the State supreme court.
The Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing or other proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken
regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions.
Litigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama
As previously reported, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit against 3M, BFI Waste Management Systems of Alabama, and others in the
Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama (the “St. John” case), seeking property damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the
Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The St. John case was stayed through January 2020, pending ongoing mediation between the parties
involved in this case and another case discussed below. The parties have submitted a joint motion to extend the stay through April 2020. 
Two
 additional
putative class actions filed in the same court by certain residents in the vicinity of the Decatur plant seeking relief on similar grounds (the Chandler case and
the Stover case, respectively) are stayed pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St. John case.
In October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (Water Authority) filed an individual complaint against 3M Company, Dyneon,
L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint also includes representative plaintiffs who
brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property who use water provided by the Water Authority and 
five
local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the “Water Utilities”). The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive
damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’ chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in
Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment
processes utilized by the Water Authority. In April 2019, 3M and the Water Authority settled the lawsuit for $
35
 million, which will fund a new water
filtration system, with 3M indemnifying the Water Authority from liability resulting from the resolution of the currently pending and future lawsuits against
the Water Authority alleging liability or damages related to 3M PFAS. The putative class claims brought by the representative plaintiffs remain, and a
motion for class certification is currently pending.
In June 2016, the Tennessee Riverkeeper, Inc. (Riverkeeper), a non-profit corporation, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama against 3M; BFI Waste Systems of Alabama; the City of Decatur, Alabama; and the Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur, Morgan County,
Alabama. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in connection with the disposal of certain PFAS
through their ownership and operation of their respective sites. The complaint further alleges such practices may present an imminent and substantial
endangerment to health and/or the environment and that Riverkeeper has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants’ failure
to abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief. This case has been stayed through April
2020, pending ongoing mediation between the parties in conjunction with the St. John case.
In August 2016, a group of over 
200
 plaintiffs filed a putative class action against West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water
Authority), 3M, Dyneon, Daikin, BFI, and the City of Decatur in state court in Lawrence County, Alabama (the “Billings” case). Plaintiffs are residents of
Lawrence, Morgan and other counties who are or have been customers of the Water Authority. They contend defendants have released PFAS that
contaminate the Tennessee River and, in turn, their drinking water, causing damage to their health and properties. In January 2017, the court in the St. John
case, discussed above, stayed this litigation pending resolution of the St. John case.
In January 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, and Daikin America in Lawrence and Morgan Counties, Alabama (the
“Owens” case). The plaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who receive their
Table of Contents
116
water from the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority). They assert common law claims for negligence, nuisance,
trespass, wantonness, and battery, and they seek injunctive relief and punitive damages. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate
manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and
surface water of their sites, resulting in discharges into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water
supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. The
court denied a motion by co-defendant Daikin to stay this case pending resolution of the St. John case, and the case is progressing through discovery.
In November 2017, a putative class action (the “King” case) was filed against 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, Daikin America, and the West Morgan-East
Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs are residents of
Lawrence and Morgan County, Alabama who receive their water from the Water Authority and seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, compensatory and
punitive damages for their alleged personal injuries. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in
Decatur that have released and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in
discharges into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water supplied by the Water Authority to the
plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. In November 2019, the King plaintiffs
amended their complaint to withdraw all class allegations, dismiss the Water Authority as a defendant, and add 
24
 new individual plaintiffs (for a total of 
59
plaintiffs).
In March 2018, an individual plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama raising allegations and claims
substantially similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs in the King case. This case was dismissed without prejudice when the plaintiffs joined a previously
pending case.
In January 2018, certain property owners in Trinity, Alabama filed a lawsuit against 3M, Dyneon, and 
three
 unnamed defendants in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs assert claims for negligence, strict liability, trespass, nuisance, wanton and reckless conduct, and citizen
suit claims for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. They allege these claims arise from the defendants’ contamination of their
property by disposal of PFAS in a landfill located on their property. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages and a court order directing the
defendants to remediate all PFAS contamination on their property. In September 2018, the case was dismissed by stipulation of the parties.
In July 2019, 3M announced that it had initiated an investigation into the possible presence of PFAS in 
three
 closed municipal landfills in Decatur that
accepted waste from 3M’s Decatur plant and other companies in the 1960s through the 1980s. 3M is working with local and state entities as it conducts its
investigation and will report the results and recommended remedial action, if any, to those entities and the public.
Litigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Minnesota
In July 2016, the City of Lake Elmo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against 3M alleging that the City suffered
damages from drinking water supplies contaminated with PFAS, including costs to construct alternative sources of drinking water. In April 2019, 3M and
the City of Lake Elmo agreed to settle the lawsuit for less than $
5
 million.
State Attorneys General Litigation related to PFAS
Minnesota.
 In December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M seeking
damages and injunctive relief with respect to the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state of
Minnesota (the “NRD Lawsuit”). In February 2018, 3M and the State of Minnesota reached a resolution of the NRD Lawsuit. Under the terms of the
settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $
850
 million grant to the State for a special “3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.” This Fund, which is
administered by the State, will enable projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to
residents and enhancing groundwater recharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as
fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $
897
 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the
first quarter of 2018 associated with the resolution of this matter.

New York.
 The State of New York, by its Attorney General, has filed 
four
 lawsuits (in June 2018, February 2019, July 2019, and November 2019) against
3M and other defendants seeking to recover the costs incurred in responding to PFAS contamination allegedly caused by Aqueous Film Forming Foam
(AFFF) manufactured by 3M and others. Each of the 
four
 suits was filed in Albany County Supreme Court before being removed to federal court, and each
has been transferred to the multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding for AFFF cases, which is discussed further below. The state is seeking compensatory
and punitive damages, and injunctive and equitable relief in the form of a monetary fund for the State’s reasonably expected future damages, and/or
requiring defendants to perform investigative and remedial work.
Ohio
.
 In December 2018, the State of Ohio, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County, Ohio against 3M, Tyco
Fire Products LP, Chemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Angus Fire Armour Corp., seeking injunctive relief and
compensatory and punitive damages for remediation costs and alleged injury to Ohio natural resources from AFFF manufacturers. This case was removed
to federal court and transferred to the MDL.
New Jersey.
 
In March 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General filed 
two
 actions against 3M, DuPont, and Chemours on behalf of the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), the NJDEP’s commissioner, and the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund regarding alleged discharges
at 
two
 DuPont facilities in Pennsville, New Jersey (Salem County) and Parlin, New Jersey (Middlesex County). 3M is included as a defendant in both cases
because it allegedly supplied PFOA to DuPont for use at the facilities at issue. Both cases expressly seek to have the defendants pay all costs necessary to
investigate, remediate, assess, and restore the affected natural resources of New Jersey. DuPont removed these cases to federal court. In August 2019, the
court stayed all proceedings in these actions pending a ruling on NJDEP’s motions to remand the cases to state court.
In May 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General and NJDEP filed a lawsuit against 3M, DuPont, and 
six
 other companies, alleging natural resource damages
from AFFF products and seeking damages, including punitive damages, and associated fees. This case was removed to federal court and transferred to the
AFFF MDL.
New Hampshire.
 In May 2019, the New Hampshire Attorney General filed 
two
 lawsuits alleging contamination of the state’s drinking water supplies and
other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. The first lawsuit was filed against 3M and 
seven
 co-defendants, alleging PFAS contamination resulting from
the use of AFFF products at several sites around the state. This case was removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. The second suit asserts
PFAS contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M, DuPont, and Chemours as defendants. This suit remains in state court in early stages of
litigation; 3M’s motion to dismiss remains pending.
Vermont.
 In June 2019, the Vermont Attorney General filed 
two
 lawsuits alleging contamination of the state’s drinking water supplies and other natural
resources by PFAS chemicals. The first lawsuit was filed against 3M and 
ten
 co-defendants, alleging PFAS contamination resulting from the use of AFFF
products at several sites around the state. This case was removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. The second suit asserts PFAS
contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M and several entities related to DuPont and Chemours as defendants. This suit remains in state court in
early stages of litigation; 3M’s motion to dismiss remains pending.
Michigan.
 In May 2019, the Michigan Attorney General issued a request for proposal seeking outside legal expertise in pursuing claims against
manufacturers, distributors, and other parties related to PFAS. In January 2020, the Michigan Attorney General filed a lawsuit in state court against 3M,
Dyneon, DuPont, Chemours and others seeking injunctive and equitable relief and damages for alleged injury to Michigan public natural resources and its
residents relating to PFAS.
Guam.
 In September 2019, the Attorney General of Guam filed a lawsuit against 3M and other defendants relating to contamination of the territory’s
drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS, allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF products at several sites around the island. This
lawsuit has been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL.
Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.
 In December 2019, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory,
filed a lawsuit against 3M and other defendants relating to contamination of the territory’s drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS,
allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF products.
In addition to the above state attorneys general actions, the Company is in discussions with several other state attorneys general and responding to
information and other requests relating to PFAS matters.

Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Environmental Litigation
3M manufactured and marketed AFFF for use in firefighting at airports and military bases from approximately 1963 to 2002. As of December 31, 2019,
150
 putative class action and other lawsuits have been filed against 3M (along with other defendants) in various state and federal courts where current or
former airports, military bases, or fire training facilities are or were located. As previously noted, some of these cases have been brought by state or territory
attorneys general. In these cases, plaintiffs typically allege that certain PFAS used in AFFF contaminated the soil and groundwater where AFFF was used
and seek damages for loss of use and enjoyment of properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, remediation costs, and in some cases,
personal injury and funds for medical monitoring. The United States, the U.S. Department of Defense and several companies have been sued along with
3M, including but not limited to Ansul Co. (acquired by Tyco, Inc.), Angus Fire, Buckeye Fire Protection Co., Chemguard, Chemours, DuPont, National
Foam, Inc., and United Technologies Corp.
In December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all AFFF cases pending in federal courts
to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. Additional AFFF cases
continue to be transferred into the MDL as they are filed or removed to federal court. As of December 31, 2019, there were 
147
 cases in the MDL, 
142
 of
which name 3M as a defendant. The parties in the MDL are currently in the process of conducting discovery.
In June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed 
eight
 AFFF cases against 3M and other
defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that
allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF
products containing long-chain PFAS. 
Two
 of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. 
Five
 cases remain
pending in state courts where they are in early stages of litigation, after Valero dismissed its Ohio state court action without prejudice in October 2019.
In September 2019, an individual plaintiff filed an AFFF lawsuit against 3M, together with the State of Alaska, Chemguard, Tyco Fire Equipment Co.,
DuPont, Chemours and other co-defendants, in state court in Alaska. Plaintiff in this case seeks property damages and medical monitoring on behalf of a
putative class. Also in September 2019, 3M was named a defendant, together with Tyco Fire Products, Chemguard, Buckeye Fire Protection and other co-
defendants, in an AFFF action filed by individual plaintiffs in state court of New York. Plaintiffs in the New York case seek damages for alleged property
damage and personal injuries, as well as injunctive relief in the form of medical monitoring and property testing and remediation.
Other PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation
3M manufactured and sold products containing various PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served
with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M’s customers’ improper
disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to
warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various
injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs.
Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal
Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc., Georgia-Pacific LLC, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., Chemours Co., and
various carpet manufacturers.
In New York, 3M is defending 
47
 individual cases and 
one
 putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and
four
 additional cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (Saint-Gobain), Honeywell International Inc. and
E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (DuPont). The plaintiffs allege that 3M manufactured and sold PFOA that was used for manufacturing purposes at Saint-
Gobain’s and Honeywell’s facilities located in the Village of Hoosick Falls and the Town of Hoosick. The plaintiffs claim that the drinking water around
Hoosick Falls became contaminated with unsafe levels of PFOA due to the activities of the defendants and allege that they suffered bodily injury due to the
ingestion and inhalation of PFOA. The plaintiffs seek unstated compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. In
addition, 3M is defending 
eight
 cases filed by Nassau County drinking water providers in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The
plaintiffs in these cases allege that 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants
Table of Contents
119
are responsible for the contamination of plaintiffs’ water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. These cases are in the preliminary stages of
 
litigation.
In Michigan, 
one
 consolidated putative class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine
World Wide (Wolverine) and other defendants. The action arises from Wolverine’s allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M
Scotchgard, related to Wolverine’s shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that
chemicals from 3M’s product contaminated the environment and drinking water sources after disposal. In addition to the consolidated federal court putative
class action, as of December 31, 2019, 3M has been named as a defendant in approximately 
257
 private individual actions in Michigan state court based on
similar allegations. These cases are coordinated for pre-trial purposes. 
Four
 of these cases were selected for bellwether trials in 2020, with the first trial
scheduled in March 2020. In January 2020, the court issued the first round of dispositive motion rulings related to the first 
two
 bellwether cases, including
dismissing the second bellwether case entirely and dismissing certain plaintiffs’ medical monitoring, risk of future disease, and granting summary judgment
to the defendants on 
one
 plaintiff’s cholesterol injury claims.
Wolverine also filed a third-party complaint against 3M in a suit by the State of Michigan and intervenor townships that seeks to compel Wolverine to
investigate and address contamination associated with its historic disposal activity. 3M filed an answer and counterclaims to Wolverine’s third-party
complaint in June 2019. In September and October 2019, the parties (including 3M as third-party defendant) engaged in mediation. In December 2019, the
State of Michigan, the intervening townships, and Wolverine announced that they had tentatively resolved the State and townships’ claims against
Wolverine in exchange for a $
70
 million payment and certain future remediation measures by Wolverine. 3M and Wolverine continue to engage in
productive settlement discussions.
3M is also a defendant, together with Georgia-Pacific as co-defendant, in a putative class action in federal court in Michigan brought by residents of
Parchment, who allege that the municipal drinking water is contaminated from waste generated by a paper mill owned by Georgia-Pacific’s corporate
predecessor. Defendants have moved to dismiss certain claims in the complaint, and the parties have begun discovery on the remaining claims.
In Alabama and Georgia, 3M is defending 
four
 state court cases, including 
three
 brought by municipal water utilities, relating to 3M’s sale of PFAS-
containing products to carpet manufacturers in Georgia. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFAS into
the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River, including Rome, Georgia
and Centre and Gadsden, Alabama. The 
three
 water utility cases remain in the early stages of litigation. 
One
 state court case was brought by individuals
asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of
Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. This case has been removed to federal court where it remains in early stages of litigation.
In Delaware, 3M is defending 
one
 putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their water supply resulting from the
operations of local metal plating facilities. Plaintiffs allege that 3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont, Chemours, and the metal platers
have also been named as defendants. This case has been removed from state court to federal court, and plaintiffs have filed a motion to remand to state
court. 3M has also filed a motion to dismiss.
In Maine, 3M was defending 
one
 individual action in state court relating to contamination of drinking water and dairy farm operations by PFAS from
wastewater sludge. In October 2019, the plaintiffs filed a notice voluntarily dismissing their case without prejudice.
In New Jersey, 3M is defending an action brought in federal court by Middlesex Water Company, alleging PFAS contamination of its water wells. 3M’s
motion to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL was denied. 3M has moved to dismiss the complaint, and the case is currently in the early stages of discovery.
In addition, 3M is defending a case brought in state court by multiple individuals with private drinking water wells near Dupont and Solvay facilities that
were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. Plaintiffs seek medical monitoring and damages. This case has been removed to federal court, where it remains
in early stages. On a separate matter, 3M was dismissed without prejudice from a class action that was previously pending in federal court in New Jersey,
relating to the DuPont Chambers Works plant.
In October 2018, 3M and other defendants, including DuPont and Chemours, were named in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio brought by the named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to PFAS chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purporting
to represent a putative class of all U.S. individuals with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood.
Table of Contents
120
The plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and conspiracy and seeks injunctive relief, including an order “establishing an independent panel of
scientists” to evaluate PFAS. 3M and other entities jointly filed a motion to dismiss in February 2019. In September 2019, the court denied the defendants’
motion to dismiss. In February 2020, the court denied 3M’s motion to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL.
Other PFAS-related Matters
In July 2019, the Company received a written request from the Subcommittee on Environment of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, U.S. House of
Representatives, seeking certain documents and information relating to the Company’s manufacturing and distribution of PFAS products. In September
2019, a 3M representative testified before and responded to questions from the Subcommittee on Environment with respect to PFAS and the Company’s
environmental stewardship initiatives. The Company continues to cooperate with the Subcommittee.
The Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (the “2009 TSCA consent order”) for
the manufacture and use of 
two
 perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at its Decatur, Alabama site that does not permit release of these materials into
“the waters of the United States.” In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that
these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company
voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management
(ADEM). During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the
processes and by treating all air emissions. These processes have been back on-line and in operation since July 2019. The Company continues to cooperate
with the EPA and ADEM in their investigations and will work with the regulatory authorities to demonstrate compliance with the release restrictions.
The Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to the terms of a Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by ADEM. The NPDES permit requires the Company to report on a monthly and quarterly basis the quality and
quantity of pollutants discharged to the Tennessee River. In June 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included
incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM.
As part of ongoing work with the EPA and ADEM to address compliance matters at the Decatur facility, the Company discovered it had not fully
characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM and announced that it
had elected to temporarily idle certain other manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur. The Company is reviewing its operations at the plant, has installed
wastewater treatment controls, has restarted certain processes, and is working to re-start the remaining idled processes in compliance with regulatory
requirements and Company policies and procedures.
In December 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama for documents
related to, among other matters, the Company’s compliance with the 2009 TSCA consent order and unpermitted discharges to the Tennessee River. The
Company is cooperating with this inquiry and will produce documents in response to the subpoena.
In addition, as part of its ongoing evaluation of regulatory compliance at its Cordova, Illinois facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized
its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cordova facility. In November 2019, the Company disclosed this matter to the EPA, and in January 2020
disclosed this matter to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA). The Company continues to work with the EPA and IEPA to address the
discharge from the Cordova facility.
The Company is also reviewing operations at its other plants with similar manufacturing processes, such as those in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, to ensure
those operations are in compliance with applicable environmental regulatory requirements and Company policies and procedures.
The Company will continue to work with relevant state and federal agencies as it conducts these reviews.
The Company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters or what potential actions may be taken by the regulatory
agencies.

Securities Litigation
In July 2019, Heavy & General Laborers’ Locals 472 & 172 Welfare Fund filed a putative securities class action against 3M Company, its former Chairman
and CEO, current Chairman and CEO, and current CFO in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2019, an individual plaintiff
filed a similar putative securities class action in the same district. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements regarding 3M's
exposure to liability associated with PFAS, and bring claims for damages under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5
against all defendants, and under Section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 against the individual defendants. In October 2019, the court
consolidated the securities class actions and appointed a group of lead plaintiffs. The suit is in the early stages of litigation.
In October 2019, a follow-on derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and
former executives and directors. In November and December 2019, 
two
 additional derivative lawsuits were filed in a Minnesota state court. The derivative
lawsuits rely on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. Plaintiffs have agreed to stay these cases pending a ruling
on a motion to dismiss the securities class action.
Other Environmental Litigation
In July 2018, the Company, along with more than 
120
 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the
cleaning up of approximately 
eight
 miles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to
design and pay the estimated $
165
 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing 
eight
 chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The
complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Company’s involvement in the case relates to its past use of 
two
commercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the
case remains to be determined.
For environmental matters and litigation described above, unless otherwise stated, no liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those
matters is not probable and estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time. The Company’s environmental
liabilities and insurance receivables are described below.
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
The Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and
estimable based on experience and developments in those matters. During the first quarter of 2019, the EPA issued its PFAS Action Plan and the Company
settled the litigation with the Water Authority (both matters are described in more detail above). The Company completed a comprehensive review with the
assistance of environmental consultants and other experts regarding environmental matters and litigation related to historical PFAS manufacturing
operations in Minnesota, Alabama, Gendorf Germany, and at 
four
 former landfills in Alabama. As a result of these developments and of that review, the
Company increased its accrual for “other environmental liabilities” by $
235
 million pre-tax (including the settlement with the Water Authority) in the first
quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, 3M updated its evaluation of certain customer-related litigation based on continued, productive
settlement discussions with multiple parties. As previously disclosed, 3M has been engaged in mediation and resolution negotiations in multiple cases. In
addition, during the fourth quarter, the Company updated its assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to its historical PFAS manufacturing
operations and expanded its evaluation of other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS-containing materials and locations at which they were disposed.
As a result of these actions during the fourth quarter the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $
214
 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had
recorded liabilities of $
445
 million for “other environmental liabilities.” The accruals represent the Company’s best estimate of the probable loss. The
Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had recorded liabilities of $
19
 million for estimated non-PFAS related “environmental remediation” costs to clean
up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to
each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable,
generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of
environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number,
participation level and financial
Table of Contents
122
viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts
recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of
remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 
20 years
.
It is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of
applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments
may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the
environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific
compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and
evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of
other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental
liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including
required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot
estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.
The Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other
environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to
the environmental matters and litigation was $
33
 million. The Company increased its receivable for insurance recoveries by $
25
 million in the first quarter
of 2019. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or
avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and
(iv) the scope of the insurers’ purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.
Product Liability Litigation
As of December 31, 2019, the Company was a named defendant in 
nine
 lawsuits in the United States involving 
12
 plaintiffs (compared to approximately
5,015
 plaintiffs at December 31, 2018) and 
one
 Canadian punitive class action with a single named plaintiff, alleging that the Bair Hugger™ patient
warming system caused a surgical site infection.
As previously disclosed, 3M had been a named defendant in lawsuits in federal courts involving over 
5,000
 plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claim they underwent
various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient
warming system. The plaintiffs seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties,
failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various
state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts.
The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of
Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding. In July 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs’ causation experts, and
granted summary judgment for 3M in all cases pending at that time in the MDL. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. Plaintiffs have also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3M in the first bellwether trial in the MDL and appealed the dismissal of another
bellwether case.
Among the 
nine
 remaining lawsuits in the United States, 
eight
 are in the MDL court. Of the 
eight
 cases in the MDL, 
four
 cases were removed from a
Missouri state court. 
Three
 of those 
four
 were dismissed with the July 2019 MDL summary judgment decision referenced above. Plaintiffs, however, have
filed motions to remand all 
four
 Missouri cases to state court. All 
eight
 remaining lawsuits in the MDL court have been stayed pending the appeal of the
summary judgment decision. The ninth case is 
one
 the Company has been defending in Hidalgo County, Texas, which combines Bair Hugger product
liability claims with medical malpractice claims. In August 2019, the U.S. District Court managing the MDL enjoined the individual plaintiff from pursuing
his claims in Texas state court because he had previously filed and dismissed a claim in the MDL. That plaintiff has appealed the order to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Texas state court has stayed the entire case while the appeal is pending.
Table of Contents
123
As previously disclosed, 3M had been named a defendant in 
61
 cases in Minnesota state court. In January 2018, the Minnesota state court excluded
plaintiffs’ experts and granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment on general causation. Plaintiffs appealed that ruling and the state court’s punitive
damages ruling. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the Minnesota state court orders in their entirety and the Minnesota Supreme Court denied
plaintiffs’ petition for review. Final dismissal was entered in April 2019, effectively ending the Minnesota state court cases.
 
In June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent
various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient
warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the
MDL.
No liability has been recorded for the Bair Hugger™ litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this
time.
In September 2011, 3M Oral Care launched Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM dental restorative material. The product was originally indicated for inlay, onlay,
veneer, and crown applications. In June 2015, 3M Oral Care voluntarily removed crown applications from the product’s instructions for use, following
reports from dentists of patients’ crowns debonding, requiring additional treatment. The product remains on the market for other applications. 3M
communicated with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as regulators outside the United States. 3M also informed customers and distributors of
its action, offered to accept return of unused materials and provide refunds. In May 2018, 3M reached a preliminary settlement for an amount that did not
have a material impact to the Company of the lawsuit pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota that sought certification of a class of
dentists in the United States and its territories. In September 2019, the court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement.
Aearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms – Version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these
earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. In December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the
San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M’s Dual-Ended Combat
Arms earplugs – Version 2. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks various
damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages. As of December 31, 2019, the Company is a named defendant in
approximately 
2,531
 lawsuits (including 
14
 putative class actions) in various state and federal courts that purport to represent approximately 
11,318
individual claimants making similar allegations. In April 2019, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted motions to transfer and
consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida to be managed in a multi-district litigation
(MDL) proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. The court conducted a case management conference in June 2019 on a discovery plan and
scheduling. Discovery is underway. No liability has been recorded for these matters because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable
and estimable at this time.
For product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is not material to the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in
excess of the established accruals at this time.
Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation
In October 2019, 3M acquired Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries, including Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. As previously disclosed in the
SEC filings by KCI entities, in 2009, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Inspector General. In 2011, following the completion of the government’s review and its decision declining to intervene in 
two
 qui tam actions described
further below, the qui tam relator-plaintiffs’ pleadings were unsealed.
The government inquiry followed 
two
 qui tam actions filed in 2008 by 
two
 former employees against Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc.
(collectively, the “KCI defendants”) under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaints contain allegations that the
KCI Defendants violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting false or fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs by billing for V.A.C.
®
Therapy in a manner that was not consistent with the Local Coverage Determinations issued by the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative
Contractors and seek monetary damages. 
One
 complaint (the “Godecke case”) also contains allegations that the KCI Defendants retaliated against the
relator-plaintiff for alleged whistle-blowing behavior.
Table of Contents
124
In October 2016, the KCI Defendants filed counterclaims in the Godecke case, asserting breach of contract and conversion. In August 2017, the fraud claim
of the Godecke case was dismissed. In January 2018, the district court stayed the retaliation claim and the KCI Defendants' counterclaims pending the
relator-plaintiff’s appeal. In September 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded the case to the district court for further
proceedings. During a January 2020 status conference, the district court ordered a stay of the proceedings until April 2020. In June 2019, following
discovery, the district court in the second case (the “Hartpence case”) entered summary judgment in the KCI Defendants’ favor on all of the relator-
plaintiff’s claims. The plaintiff then filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which is pending. No liability has been recorded for
these matters because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.
Compliance Matter
The Company, through its internal processes, discovered certain travel activities and related funding and record keeping issues raising concerns, arising
from marketing efforts by certain business groups based in China. The Company initiated an internal investigation to determine whether the expenditures
may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other potentially applicable anti-corruption laws. The Company has retained outside
counsel and a forensic accounting firm to assist with the investigation. In July 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed this investigation to both the
Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission and is cooperating with both agencies. The Company cannot predict at this time the
outcome of its investigation or what potential actions may be taken by the Department of Justice or Securities and Exchange Commission.
NOTE 17. Leases
The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and related standards (collectively ASC 842, 
Leases
), which replaced previous lease accounting guidance, on
January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. 3M elected the transition method expedient which allows entities to initially apply the
requirements by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. As a result of electing this
transition method, prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative net impact of adopting ASC 842, the January 1, 2019 balance of retained
earnings was increased by $
14
 million, primarily relating to previously deferred gains from sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, adoption of the new
standard resulted in the recording of right of use 
assets
 and associated lease liabilities of $
0.8
 billion each as of January 1, 2019. The Company’s accounting
for finance leases (previously called capital leases) remains substantially unchanged. ASC 842 did not have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated income
statement. 3M elected the 
package
 of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within ASC 842, which includes not reassessing lease
classification of existing leases. The Company did not elect the 
hindsight
 practical expedient.

in a leased facility. 3M has the following primary capital leases:
●
In 2003, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately

NOTE 18. Stock-Based Compensation
The 3M 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 
123,965,000
 shares of 3M common stock pursuant to awards granted
under the plan. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining shares available for
grant under the LTIP Program are 
22
 million and there were approximately 
6,700
 participants with outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock
units.
The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of
individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on
the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense
recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at age 
55
 and after having completed 
ten years
 of service.
This retiree-eligible population represents 
37
 percent of the annual grant’s stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation
expense is recognized in the first quarter.
In addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. The Company
issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and
are considered immaterial by the Company.
Beginning in 2016, as a result of the Company’s application of ASU No. 2016-09, 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
, certain
excess tax benefits at the time of exercise (for an option) or upon vesting (for restricted stock units) are recognized as income tax benefits in the statement
of income. These amounts totaled $
89
 million, $
100
 million, and $
228
 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are reflected in the “income tax
benefits” line within the stock-based compensation table below.
Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance shares and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following table. Capitalized stock-
based compensation amounts were not material.

Stock options generally vest over a period from 
one
 to 
three years
 with the expiration date at 
10 years
 from date of grant. As of December 31, 2019, there
was $
62
 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 
20 months
. For options outstanding at December 31, 2019, the weighted-average
remaining contractual life was 
64 months
 and the aggregate intrinsic value was $
1.1
 billion. For options exercisable at December 31, 2019, the weighted-
average remaining contractual life was 
54 months
 and the aggregate intrinsic value was $
1.1
 billion.
The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $
433
 million, $
469
 million and $
703
 million, respectively. Cash
received from options exercised during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $
375
 million, $
316
 million and $
585
 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax
benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $
91
 million, $
99
 million and $
238
million, respectively.
For the primary annual stock option grant, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
and the assumptions that follow.

Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. For the 2019 annual grant date, the
Company estimated the expected volatility based upon the following three volatilities of 3M stock: the median of the term of the expected life rolling
volatility; the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility; and the implied volatility on the grant date. The expected term assumption is
based on the weighted average of historical grants.

As of December 31, 2019, there was $
72
 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted
stock units. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 
22 months
. The total fair value of restricted
stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $
144
 million, $
155
 million and $
136
 million,
respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units for 2019,
2018 and 2017 was $
28
 million, $
29
 million and $
45
 million, respectively.
Restricted stock units granted generally vest 
three years
 following the grant date assuming continued employment. Dividend equivalents equal to the
dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on these restricted stock units during the vesting period, although 
no
dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends are paid out in cash at the vest date
on restricted stock units. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is 
no
 impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average
restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Performance Shares
Instead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The 2019 performance
criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and earnings per share growth) were
selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that
could actually be delivered at the end of the 
three-year
 performance period may be anywhere from 
0
% to 
200
% of each performance share granted,
depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. When granted, these performance shares are awarded at 
100
% of the
estimated number of shares at the end of the 
three-year
 performance period and are reflected under “Granted” in the table below. Non-substantive vesting
requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over 
one
 or 
three years
 depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The
performance share grants accrue dividends, therefore the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to
dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is
complete are included in computation of diluted earnings per share.

to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 
85
% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the
beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.
The weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $
27.14
, $

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information
3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M
manages its operations in 
four
 business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M’s 
four
 business
segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient
sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial
intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated
independently, would report the operating income information shown. The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to other
expense (income), which is not allocated to business segments. Further information about which is included in Note 6.
Effective in the second quarter of 2019, to enable the Company to better serve global customers and markets, the Company made the following changes to
its business segments:
Realignment of the Company’s business segments from 
five
 to 
four
 
The Company realigned its former 
five
 business segments into 
four
: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.
Existing divisions were largely realigned to this new structure. In addition, certain retail auto care product lines formerly in the Automotive Aftermarket
Division (now within the Safety and Industrial business segment) were moved to the Construction and Home Improvement Division (within the Consumer
business segment). Also, product lines relating to the refrigeration filtration business, formerly included in the Separation and Purification Sciences
Division (now within the Health Care business segment) were moved to Other Safety and Industrial (within the Safety and Industrial business segment). 3M
business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. Dual credit, which is
Table of Contents
131
based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country, was reduced as a result
of the closer alignment between customer account activity and their respective markets. The 
four
 business segments are as follows:
Safety and Industrial
: This segment includes businesses that serve the global industrial, electrical and safety markets. This business segment consists of
personal safety, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, closure and masking systems, electrical markets, automotive aftermarket, and roofing granules.
This segment also includes the Communication Markets Division (which was substantially sold in 2018) and the refrigeration filtration product lines
(within Other Safety and Industrial).
Transportation and Electronics:
 This segment includes businesses that serve global transportation and electronic original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
customers. This business segment consists of electronics (display materials and systems, electronic materials solutions), automotive and aerospace,
commercial solutions, advanced materials, and transportation safety.
Health Care
: This business segment serves the global healthcare industry and includes medical solutions, oral care, separation and purification sciences,
health information systems, drug delivery systems, and food safety.
Consumer
: This business serves global consumers and consists of home improvement, stationery and office supplies, home care, and consumer health care.
This segment also includes, within the Construction and Home Improvement Division, certain retail auto care product lines.
In addition, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following
changes, effective in the first quarter of 2019, and other revisions impacting business segment reporting:
Continued alignment of customer account activity
●
As part of 3M’s regular customer-focus initiatives, the Company realigned certain customer account activity (“sales district”) to correlate with the
primary divisional product offerings in various countries and reduce complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. This
largely impacted the amount of dual credit certain business segments receive as a result of sales district attribution. 3M business segment reporting
measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment
provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country.
Creation of Closure and Masking Systems Division and Medical Solutions Division
●
3M created the Closure and Masking Systems Division, which combines the masking tape, packaging tape and personal care portfolios formerly
within Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division in the former Industrial business segment into a separate division also within the former Industrial
business segment. 3M created the Medical Solutions Division in the Health Care business segment, which combines the former Critical and Chronic
Care Division and Infection Prevention Division (which were also both within the Health Care business segment).
Additional actions impacting business segment reporting
●
The business associated with certain safety products sold through retail channels in the Asia Pacific region was realigned from the Personal Safety
Division within the former Safety and Graphics business segment to the Construction and Home Improvement Division within the Consumer
business segment. In addition, certain previously non-allocated costs related to manufacturing and technology of centrally managed material
resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated are now reflected as being allocated to the business segments.
The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.

Corporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative
gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain
under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments.
Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer
of all of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is
subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates
each of its 
four
 business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth.
As a result, 3M reflects additional (“dual”) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect to the
particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division
level. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and
Electronics business
Table of Contents
133
segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular
customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales
district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that
would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled
“Elimination of Dual Credit,” such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.
Geographic Information
Geographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and
expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made.

 per diluted share occurred in the fourth quarter. In the second quarter of
2019, the Company recorded a non-operating charge related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary, which reduced net income by $
162
million, or $
0.28
 per diluted share.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges related to the previously disclosed resolution of the State of
Minnesota Natural Resource Damages (NRD) lawsuit, which reduced net income by $
710
 million, or $
1.16
 per diluted share. Refer to Note 16 for
additional details. Additionally, the first quarter of 2018 was impacted by a measurement period adjustment related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (TCJA), which reduced net income by $
217
 million, or $
0.36
 per diluted share. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company’s ongoing IRS examination under the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) and new guidance released under
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a charge that reduced net income by $
60
 million, or $
0.11
 per diluted share. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of
2018, the Company finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a reversal of previously recorded tax expense that increased net income by $
41
 million, or
$
0.07
 per diluted share. On a combined basis, these items, including the impacts detailed above for the first quarter of 2018, reduced net income by $
946
million, or $
1.57
 per diluted share in 2018.

Item 9A. 
Controls
 and Procedures.
a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
b. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 
31, 2019, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
 
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 excluded M*Modal and
 
Acelity, which were acquired by the Company in February 2019 and October 2019, respectively. The total assets and total net sales of M*Modal and Acelity
 
collectively represent 2 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of  December 31, 2019. Companies
 
are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the year of acquisition while integrating the
 
acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
 
December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
 
included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
 
2019.
c. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
The Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain
financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a
worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.
The Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the
United States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,
this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for
effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the
implementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
 
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
 
The following description of our Common Stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by
reference to our Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), each of which are
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. We encourage you to read our Certificate of
Incorporation, our Bylaws and the applicable provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law for additional information. 
 
 
General
 
We are authorized to 
issue
 up to 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock without par value.
 
Voting Rights
 
Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders.
 
Dividends
 
Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive ratably
such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose.
 
Rights Upon Liquidation
 
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably
in all assets remaining 
after
 payment of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then
outstanding.
 
Preemptive or Conversion Rights
 
The holders of our common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights.  There are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to the common stock.
 
Preferred Stock
 
The board of directors has the authority, without action by the stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series and to
designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each series, which may be greater than the rights of the common stock.  It is not possible to state the
actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock upon the rights of holders of the common stock until the board of directors determines the
specific rights of the holders of such preferred stock.  However, the effects might include, among other things:
 
·
                  
restricting dividends on the common stock,
 
·
                  
diluting the voting power of the common stock,
 
·
                  
impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock, or
 
·
                  
delaying or preventing a change in control of us without further action by the stockholders.
 
No shares of preferred stock are outstanding, and we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.
 
Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware Law
 
Some provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover
practices and inadequate takeover bids.  These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our
board.  We believe that these provisions give our board the flexibility to exercise its fiduciary duties in a manner consistent with the interests of our
shareholders.
 
·
                  
STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS.  Under our bylaws, the board of directors or the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the
secretary (with the concurrence of a majority of the board) may call special meetings of stockholders; in addition, record holders of 25% or
more of the total 3M shares entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before a special meeting may also cause the meeting to be
held, but, if the Company’s board of directors determines in good faith that the business specified in the stockholders’ request will be included
in an upcoming annual meeting of stockholders within 90 days after the request, the special meeting will not be held.
 
·
                  
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS.  Our bylaws establish
advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than
nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors.
 
·
                  
DELAWARE LAW.  We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-
held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the
date the person became an interested stockholder, unless the “business combination” or the transaction in which the person became an
interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner.  Generally, a “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other
transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder.  Generally, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with
affiliates and associates, owns or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own, 15% or more of a
corporation’s voting stock.  The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in
advance by the board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of
common stock held by stockholders.
 
·
                  
ELIMINATION OF STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT.  Our Certificate of Incorporation eliminates the right of
stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting.
 
·
                  
ELIMINATION OF CUMULATIVE VOTING.  Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting in the
election of directors.
 
·
                  
UNDESIGNATED PREFERRED STOCK.  The authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the board of directors to
issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us.  These and
other provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of us.
 
 
Transfer Agent and Registrar
 
The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is EQ Shareowner Services.
 
Exchange Listing
 
Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, our primary exchange, under the symbol “MMM.” Our common stock is also listed on the
Chicago Stock Exchange under the same symbol.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE 2026 NOTES
 
Interest
 
The 2026 notes mature on November 9, 2026 and accrue interest at a rate per year equal to 1.500%.  Interest on the 2026 notes accrued from the
last interest payment date on which interest was paid or duly provided for, or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from their date of ongoing
issuance.  Interest on the 2026 notes is payable annually in arrears on November 9 of each year.
 
Interest on the 2026 notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual
number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 2026 notes (on the date of original issuance (November 12, 2014), if no
interest has been paid on the 2026 notes), to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. 
 
If any interest payment date, the maturity date for the notes or earlier date of redemption falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required
payment will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for
the period from and after that interest payment date, that maturity date or that date of redemption, as the case may be.  For purposes of the 2026 notes,
“Business Day” means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institution in The City of New York or London
are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and (2) on which the TARGET2 system, or any successor thereto, is open.
 
Optional Redemption
The 2026 notes are redeemable, in whole but not in part at our option, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the
principal amount of such 2026 notes or (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption)
discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (based on the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365 (or, if any of those days elapsed fall in a
leap year, the sum of (x) the number of those days falling in a leap year divided by 366 and (y) the number of those days falling in a non-leap year divided
by 365)) at the Reference Dealer Rate (as defined below), plus in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.
        For the purposes of this "Optional Redemption" section,
        "Business Day" means, in relation to any place, a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments in that place.
        "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Dealer (as defined below).
        "Reference Dealer" means any of Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities plc or their
respective successors.
        "Reference Dealer Rate" means with respect to the Reference Dealer and any redemption date, the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three
decimal places, 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield (as calculated by the Reference Dealer) on the 2026 notes, if they were
to be purchased at such price on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such
Business Day of the Reference Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Reference Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such
Business Day as determined by the Reference Dealer.
        "Reference Bond" means, in relation to the Reference Dealer Rate, at the discretion of the Reference Dealer, an European government bond whose
maturity is closest to the maturity of the 2026 notes, or such other European government bond as the Reference Dealer, may, with the advice of three
brokers of, or market makers in, European government bonds selected by the Reference Dealer, determine to be appropriate for determining the Reference
Dealer Rate.
        Notice of any redemption will be given to the holders of the 2026 notes at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date. Unless
we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the 2026 notes called for redemption.
        The 2026 notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturity if certain events occur involving United States taxation. If any of these special tax
events do occur, the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including,
the date fixed for redemption. See "—Redemption for Tax Reasons."
Payment of Additional Interest
        We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest to a noteholder that is a United States Alien (as defined
below) such amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment on the 2026 notes after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or
future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided for in the 2026 notes to be then due and payable. However, we
will not be required to make any payment of additional interest for or on account of:
(a)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former
connection between such holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor or beneficiary of, or a person holding a power over, such holder, if such
holder is an estate or a trust, or a member or shareholder of such holder, if such holder is a partnership or corporation) and the United
States, including, without limitation, such holder (or such
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, person holding a power, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident or treated as a
resident thereof or being or having been engaged in trade or business or present therein or having or having had a permanent
establishment therein, or (ii) the presentation by the holder of a note for payment more than 15 days after the date on which such payment
became due and payable or on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
 
(b)

Federal income tax;
 
(d)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on a
note;
 
 
(e)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be deducted or withheld by any paying agent from any payment on a
note, if such payment can be made without such deduction or withholding by any other paying agent;
 
(f)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the holder's failure to comply with any
applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity or
connection with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of a note if, without regard to any tax treaty, such compliance is
required by statute or regulation of the United States as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;
 
 
(g)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the holder (i) owning or having owned, directly or indirectly,
actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company entitled to vote,
(ii) receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the United States Internal Revenue Code or (iii) being a controlled foreign
corporation with respect to the United States that is related to the Company by actual or constructive stock ownership;
 
(h)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed on a payment pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the United
States Internal Revenue Code (FATCA), any Treasury regulations and official interpretations thereof, and any regulations or official
law, agreement or interpretations thereof implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto; or
 
(i)
any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) (g) and (h);
nor shall such additional interest be paid with respect to any payment on a note to a holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial
owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not
have been entitled to the additional interest had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of the 2026 notes.  
        For purposes of the foregoing, the holding of or the receipt of any payment with respect to a note shall not constitute a connection between the holder
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or a person having power over, such holder if such holder is an estate, a trust, a
partnership or a corporation) and the United States.
        The term "United States Alien" means any person who, for United States Federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien
individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership one or more of the
members of which is, for United States Federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a nonresident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary
of a foreign estate or trust.
Redemption for Tax Reasons
        If, in the written opinion of independent counsel chosen by the Company, there is a substantial probability that the Company has or will become
obligated to pay additional interest on the 2026 notes as described above under the heading "—Payment of Additional Interest", as a result of any of the
following events occurring on or after November 12, 2014 (a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or any change in official position
regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, (b) any action taken by a taxing authority of the United States or any political
subdivision thereof or therein affecting taxation, which action is generally applied or is taken with respect to the Company, (c) a decision rendered by a
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, whether or not such decision was rendered with respect to
the Company, (d) a private letter ruling or technical advice memorandum issued by the National Office of the United States Internal Revenue Service on
substantially the same facts as those affecting the Company or (e) any change, amendment, application, interpretation or execution of the laws of the United
States (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) shall have been officially proposed, which change, amendment, action, application,
interpretation or execution would have effect after November 12, 2014 and the Company determines that such obligation cannot be avoided by the use of
reasonable measures then available to the Company, then the Company may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the
holders for the time being of the notes, redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100%. of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest
date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such additional interest if a payment in respect to the notes were due on such date and, at the time
such notification of redemption is given, such obligation to pay such additional interest remains in effect. Prior to the publication of any notice of
redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee (i) a certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such
redemption and that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company to so redeem have occurred and (ii) an opinion of independent counsel chosen by
the Company to the effect that there is a substantial probability that the Company has or will become obligated to pay additional interest on the notes.
CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE 2020 NOTES, THE 2023 NOTES AND THE 2030 NOTES
 
The 2020 Notes
        The 2020 notes bear interest at a rate equivalent to the 3-month EURIBOR (as defined below) (the "Base Rate") plus 0.23% per year; provided,
however, that the minimum interest rate shall be zero. The 2020 notes bear interest from their date of original issuance (May 20, 2015) or from the
immediately preceding interest payment date to which interest has been paid. Interest on the 2020 notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 15,
May 15, August 15 and November 15, (the "Floating Rate Interest Payment Date"). The interest rate on the 2020 notes will be reset quarterly on
February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15. The interest rate on the 2020 notes will be determined on the second TARGET business day preceding
the interest reset date (a "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"). Interest on a Floating Rate Interest Payment Date will be paid to the persons, or
"holders," in whose names the 2020 notes are registered on the security register at the close of business on the regular record date. The regular record date
will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding the related Floating Rate Interest Payment Date. Interest on the
2020 notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated.
        The 2020 notes bear interest at a base rate equal to the interest rate for deposits in euros designated as "EURIBOR" and sponsored jointly by the
European Banking Federation and ACI—the Financial Market Association (or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling
and publishing that rate) on a EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, and will be determined in accordance with the following provisions:
·
EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euros having a maturity of three months beginning on such interest reset date, as that rate
appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the relevant EURIBOR Interest Determination Date.
 
·
If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Page EURIBOR01, EURIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at
approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the relevant EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, at which deposits of the following kind
are offered to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market by the principal Euro-zone office of each of four major banks in that market
selected by us: euro deposits having a maturity of three months and in a principal amount of not less than €1,000,000 that is representative
for a single transaction in such market at such time. The Paying and Calculation Agent will request the principal Euro-zone office of each of
these banks to provide a quotation in writing of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided in writing, EURIBOR for such EURIBOR
Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards) of such quotations.
 
·
If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR for the relevant EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the
arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading Euro-Zone banks quoted in writing, at approximately 11:00 A.M.,
Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in the Euro-Zone selected by us: loans of euros having
a maturity of three months and in a principal amount of not less than €1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market
at such time.
 
·
If fewer than three banks selected by us are quoting as described above, EURIBOR shall be the EURIBOR in effect on such EURIBOR
Interest Determination Date.
        If any Floating Rate Interest Payment Date, maturity date or earlier date of redemption falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment
will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the
period from and after that Floating Rate Interest Payment Date, that maturity date or that date of redemption, as the case may be. For purposes of the notes,
"Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or London
are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real Time Gross Settlement
Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, is open.
The 2023 Notes
        The 2023 notes bear interest at 0.950% per year from May 20, 2015 or from the immediately preceding interest payment date to which interest has
been paid. Interest on the 2023 notes is payable annually in arrears on May 15, commencing May 15, 2016 (the "2023 Interest Payment Date"). Interest on
a 2023 Interest Payment Date will be paid to the persons, or "holders," in whose names the 2023 notes are registered on the security register at the close of
business on the regular record date. The regular record date for the 2023 notes will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day,
immediately preceding the related 2023 Interest Payment Date. Interest on the 2023 notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the
period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 2023 notes (or
May 20, 2015, if no interest has been paid on the 2023 notes), to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is
referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.
        If any 2023 Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date for the 2023 notes or earlier date of redemption falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the
required payment will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so
payable for the period from and after that 2023 Interest Payment Date, that Maturity Date or that date of redemption, as the case may be. For purposes of
the 2023 notes, "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of
New York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and (2) on which the TARGET2 system, or any successor
thereto, is open.
The 2030 Notes
        The 2030 notes bear interest at 1.750% per year from May 20, 2015 or from the immediately preceding interest payment date to which interest has
been paid. Interest on the 2030 notes is payable annually in arrears on May 15, commencing May 15, 2016 (the "2030 Interest Payment Date"). Interest on
a 2030 Interest Payment Date will be paid to the persons, or "holders," in whose names the 2030 notes are registered on the security register at the close of
business on the regular record date. The regular record date for the 2030 notes will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day,
immediately preceding the related 2030 Interest Payment Date. Interest on the 2030 notes will be computed on the basis of the ACTUAL/ACTUAL
(ICMA) payment convention described above under "Description of Notes—2023 Notes."
        If any 2030 Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date for the 2030 notes or earlier date of redemption falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the
required payment will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so
payable for the period from and after that 2030 Interest Payment Date, that Maturity Date or that date of redemption, as the case may be. For purposes of
the 2030 notes, "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of
New York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and (2) on which the TARGET2 system, or any successor

Optional Redemption
        The 2023 notes and the 2030 notes are redeemable, in whole but not in part at our option, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of
(i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes of the applicable tranche or (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined below), the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of
the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (based on the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365 (or, if any of
those days elapsed fall in a leap year, the sum of (x) the number of those days falling in a leap year divided by 366 and (y) the number of those days falling
in a non-leap year divided by 365)) at the Reference Dealer Rate (as defined below), plus, in the case of the 2023 notes, 10 basis points, and in the case of
the 2030 notes, 15 basis points, plus in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.
        For the purposes of this "Optional Redemption" section,
        "Business Day" means, in relation to any place, a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments in that place.
        "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Dealer (as defined below).
        "Reference Dealer" means any of Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch or their respective
successors.
        "Reference Dealer Rate" means with respect to the Reference Dealer and any redemption date, the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three
decimal places, 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield (as calculated by the Reference Dealer) on the notes to be redeemed, if
they were to be purchased at such price on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on
such Business Day of the Reference Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Reference Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such
Business Day as determined by the Reference Dealer.
        "Reference Bond" means, in relation to the Reference Dealer Rate, at the discretion of the Reference Dealer, an European government bond whose
maturity is closest to the maturity of the notes to be redeemed, or such other European government bond as the Reference Dealer, may, with the advice of
three brokers of, or market makers in, European government bonds selected by the Reference Dealer, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Reference Dealer Rate.
        Notice of any redemption will be given to the Noteholders at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date. Unless we default in
payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the 2023 notes and the 2030 notes called for redemption.
        The notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturity if certain events occur involving United States taxation. If any of these special tax events do
occur, the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date
fixed for redemption. See "—Redemption for Tax Reasons."
Payment of Additional Interest

withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature imposed upon or as a result of such
payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided for in such note to be then due and payable. However, we will not be required to
make any payment of additional interest for or on account of:
(a)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former
connection between such holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor or beneficiary of, or a person holding a power over, such holder, if such
holder is an estate or a trust, or a member or shareholder of such holder, if such holder is a partnership or corporation) and the United
States, including, without limitation, such holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, person holding a power, member or

required by statute or regulation of the United States as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

Redemption for Tax Reasons
        If, in the written opinion of independent counsel chosen by the Company, there is a substantial probability that the Company has or will become
obligated to pay additional interest on 2020 notes, the 2023 notes or the 2030 notes the notes as described above under the heading "—Payment of
Additional Interest," as a result of any of the following events occurring on or after May 13, 2015 (a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any
regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or
any change in official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, (b) any action taken by a taxing authority of
the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein affecting taxation, which action is generally applied or is taken with respect to the Company,
(c) a decision rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, whether or not such decision
was rendered with respect to the Company, (d) a private letter ruling or technical advice memorandum issued by the National Office of the United States
Internal Revenue Service on substantially the same facts as those affecting the Company or (e) any change, amendment, application, interpretation or
execution of the laws of the United States (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) shall have been officially proposed, which change,
amendment, action, application, interpretation or execution would have effect after May 13, 2015 and the Company determines that such obligation cannot
be avoided by the use of reasonable measures then available to the Company, then the Company may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than
60 days' prior notice to the holders for the time being of the notes, redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100%. of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier
than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such additional interest if a payment in respect to the notes were due
on such date and, at the time such notification of redemption is given, such obligation to pay such additional interest remains in effect. Prior to the
publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee (i) a certificate stating that the Company is
entitled to effect such redemption and that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company to so redeem have occurred and (ii) an opinion of
independent counsel chosen by the Company to the effect that there is a substantial probability that the Company has or will become obligated to pay
additional interest on the notes.
CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE 2022 NOTES AND THE 2031 NOTES
The 2022 Notes
        The 2022 notes bear interest at 0.375% per year from May 31, 2016 or from the immediately preceding interest payment date to which interest has
been paid. Interest on the 2022 notes is payable annually in arrears on February 15, commencing February 15, 2017 (the "2022 Interest Payment Date").
Interest on a 2022 Interest Payment Date will be paid to the persons, or "holders," in whose names the 2022 notes are registered on the security register at
the close of business on the regular record date. The regular record date for the 2022 notes will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day,
immediately preceding the related 2022 Interest Payment Date. Interest on the 2022 notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the
period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 2022 notes (or
May 31, 2016, if no interest has been paid on the 2022 notes), to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is
referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.
        If any 2022 Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date for the 2022 notes or earlier date of redemption falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the
required payment will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so
payable for the period from and after that 2022 Interest Payment Date, that Maturity Date or that date of redemption, as the case may be. For purposes of
the 2022 notes, "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New
York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and (2) on which the TARGET2 system, or any successor thereto,
is open.
The 2031 Notes
        The 2031 notes bear interest at 1.500% per year from May 31, 2016 or from the immediately preceding interest payment date to which interest has
been paid. Interest on the 2031 notes is payable annually in arrears on June 2, commencing June 2, 2017 (the "2031
Interest Payment Date"). Interest on a 2031 Interest Payment Date will be paid to the persons, or "holders," in whose names the 2031 notes are registered on
the security register at the close of business on the regular record date. The regular record date for the 2031 notes will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether
or not a Business Day, immediately preceding the related 2031 Interest Payment Date. Interest on the 2031 notes will be computed on the basis of the
ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) payment convention described above under "Description of Notes—2022 Notes."
        If any 2031 Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date for the 2031 notes or earlier date of redemption falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the
required payment will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so
payable for the period from and after that 2031 Interest Payment Date, that Maturity Date or that date of redemption, as the case may be. For purposes of
the 2031 notes, "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New
York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and (2) on which the TARGET2 system, or any successor thereto,
is open.
Further Issuances
        We may, from time to time, without the consent of or notice to existing note holders, create and issue further notes having the same terms and
conditions as the notes of either tranche in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and, to the extent applicable, the first payment of interest.
Additional notes issued in this manner will be consolidated with and will form a single tranche of debt securities with the related previously outstanding
notes of the related tranche; 
provided
,  
however
, that the issuance of such additional notes will not be so consolidated for United States federal income tax
purposes unless such issuance constitutes a "qualified reopening" within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder.
Optional Redemption
        The notes of each tranche are redeemable, in whole but not in part at our option, at any time prior to November 15, 2021, in the case of the 2022 notes
(three months prior to the maturity date of such notes), and March 2, 2031 in the case of the 2031 notes (three months, prior to the maturity of such notes),
at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes of the applicable tranche or (ii) as determined by the Quotation
Agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of
such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (based on the actual number of days
elapsed divided by 365 (or, if any of those days elapsed fall in a leap year, the sum of (x) the number of those days falling in a leap year divided by 366 and
(y) the number of those days falling in a non-leap year divided by 365)) at the Reference Dealer Rate (as defined below), plus, in the case of the 2022 notes,
12.5 basis points, and in the case of the 2031 notes, 20 basis points, plus in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.
        In addition, at any time on or after November 15, 2021, in the case of the 2022 notes (three months prior to the maturity date of such notes), and
March 2, 2031 in the case of the 2031 notes (three months prior to the maturity date of such notes), the notes will be redeemable, in whole but not in part at
our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes of the applicable tranche plus accrued interest thereon to the date of
redemption.
        For the purposes of this "Optional Redemption" section,
        "Business Day" means, in relation to any place, a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments in that place.
        "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Dealer (as defined below) specified by us.
        "Reference Dealer" means any of Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch or their
respective successors.
        "Reference Dealer Rate" means with respect to the Reference Dealer and any redemption date, the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three
decimal places, 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield (as calculated by the Reference Dealer) on the notes to be redeemed, if
they were to be purchased at such price on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on
such Business Day of the Reference Bond on the basis of
the middle market price of the Reference Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Business Day as determined by the Reference Dealer.
        "Reference Bond" means, in relation to the Reference Dealer Rate, at the discretion of the Reference Dealer, an European government bond whose
maturity is closest to the maturity of the notes to be redeemed, or such other European government bond as the Reference Dealer, may, with the advice of
three brokers of, or market makers in, European government bonds selected by the Reference Dealer, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Reference Dealer Rate.
        Notice of any redemption will be given to the noteholders at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date. Unless we default in
payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the notes called for redemption.
        The notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturity if certain events occur involving United States taxation. If any of these special tax events do
occur, the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date
fixed for redemption. See "—Redemption for Tax Reasons."
Payment of Additional Interest
        We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest to a noteholder that is a United States Alien (as defined
below) such amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment on such note after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future
tax, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided for in such note to be then due and payable. However, we will
not be required to make any payment of additional interest for or on account of:
(a)
 any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former
connection between such holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor or beneficiary of, or a person holding a power over, such holder, if such
holder is an estate or a trust, or a member or shareholder of such holder, if such holder is a partnership or corporation) and the United States,
including, without limitation, such holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, person holding a power, member or shareholder) being or
having been a citizen or resident or treated as a resident thereof or being or having been engaged in trade or business or present therein or
having or having had a permanent establishment therein, or (ii) the presentation by the holder of a note for payment more than 15 days after
the date on which such payment became due and payable or on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
 
(b)
any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(c)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for such holder's past or present status as a
controlled foreign corporation, passive foreign investment company (including a qualified election fund) or foreign private foundation or
other tax exempt organization with respect to the United States or as a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal
income tax;
 
(d)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on a note
 
(e)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be deducted or withheld by any paying agent from any payment on a note, if
such payment can be made without such deduction or withholding by any other paying agent;
 
(f)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the holder's failure to comply with any
applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity or
connection with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of a note if, without regard to any tax treaty, such compliance is required
by statute or regulation of the United States as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental
charge;
 
(g)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the holder (i) owning or having owned, directly or indirectly,
actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company entitled to vote,
(ii) receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the United States Internal Revenue Code or (iii) being a controlled foreign
corporation with respect to the United States that is related to the Company by actual or constructive stock ownership;
 
(h)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed on a payment pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code (FATCA), any Treasury regulations and official interpretations thereof, and any regulations or official law,
agreement or interpretations thereof implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto; or
 
(i)
any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) (g) and (h);
nor shall such additional interest be paid with respect to any payment on a note to a holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial
owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not
have been entitled to the additional interest had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of such note.
        For purposes of the foregoing, the holding of or the receipt of any payment with respect to a note shall not constitute a connection between the holder
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or a person having power over, such holder if such holder is an estate, a trust, a
partnership or a corporation) and the United States.
        The term "United States Alien" means any person who, for United States Federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien
individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership one or more of the members of which is, for United States
federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a nonresident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust.
Redemption for Tax Reasons
        If, in the written opinion of independent counsel chosen by the Company, there is a substantial probability that the Company has or will become
obligated to pay additional interest on the notes as described above under the heading "—Payment of Additional Interest," as a result of any of the following
events occurring on or after May 23, 2016 (a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the
United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or any change in official position regarding the application
or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, (b) any action taken by a taxing authority of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or
therein affecting taxation, which action is generally applied or is taken with respect to the Company, (c) a decision rendered by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, whether or not such decision was rendered with respect to the Company,
(d) a private letter ruling or technical advice memorandum issued by the National Office of the United States Internal Revenue Service on substantially the
same facts as those affecting the Company or (e) any change, amendment, application, interpretation or execution of the laws of the United States (or any
regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) shall have been officially proposed, which change, amendment, action, application, interpretation or
execution would have effect after May 23, 2016 and the Company determines that such obligation cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures
then available to the Company, then the Company may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders for the time
being of the notes, redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if
any, to the date fixed for redemption, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Company would be obligated to pay such additional interest if a payment in respect to the notes were due on such date and, at the time such notification of
redemption is given, such obligation to pay such additional interest remains in effect. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this
paragraph, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee (i) a certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and that the conditions
precedent to the right of the Company to so redeem have occurred and (ii) an opinion of independent counsel chosen by the Company to the effect that
there is a substantial probability that the Company has or will become obligated to pay additional interest on the notes.
 
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS OF OUR INDENTURE APPLICABLE TO ALL NOTES
 
Events of Default
 
An event of default with respect to any of the notes will occur under the indenture if:
 
·
                  
we fail to pay interest on any debt security of that series for 30 days after the payment is due,
 
·
                  
we fail to pay the principal of or any premium on any debt security of that series when due,
 
·
                  
we fail to deposit any sinking fund payment when due on debt securities of that series,
 
·
                  
we fail to perform any other covenant in the indenture that applies to debt securities of that series for 90 days after we have received written
notice of the failure to perform in the manner specified in the indenture,
 
·
                  
we default under any Indebtedness for borrowed money, including other series of debt securities, or under any mortgage, lien or other similar
encumbrance, indenture or instrument, including the indenture, which secures any Indebtedness for borrowed money, and which results in
acceleration of the maturity of an outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness greater than $200 million, unless this acceleration is rescinded
(or the Indebtedness is discharged) within 10 days after we have received written notice of the default in the manner specified in the indenture,
 
·
                  
commencement of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, or
 
·
                  
any other event of default that may be specified for the debt securities of that series when that series is created occurs.  (Section 501)
 
If an event of default for any series of debt securities occurs and continues, the trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities of the series may declare the entire principal of all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately.  If such a
declaration occurs, the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series can, subject to the specific
payment conditions set forth in the indenture, rescind the declaration.  (Section 502)
 
The prospectus supplement relating to each series of debt securities which are original issue discount securities will describe the particular provisions that
relate to the acceleration of maturity of a portion of the principal amount of that series when an event of default occurs and continues.
 
An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of debt securities issued
under the indenture.  The indenture requires us to file a certificate with the trustee each year that states the nature of the default if any default exists under
the terms of the indenture.  (Section 1011) The trustee must transmit notice to the Holders of debt securities of any default, except that no such notice to
Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence of a default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in
the indenture, and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given to the Company by the trustee, or to the Company
and the trustee by Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series, written notice of such default or
breach.  (Section 602)
 
Other than its duties in the case of a default, a trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request, order or
direction of any Holders, unless the Holders offer the trustee reasonable indemnification.  (Sections 601, 603) If reasonable indemnification is provided,
then, subject to other rights of the trustee provided in the indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any
series may, with respect to the debt securities of that series, direct the time, method and place of:
 
·
                  
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or
 
·
                  
exercising any trust or power conferred upon the trustee.  (Sections 512, 603)
 
The Holder of a debt security of any series will have the right to begin any proceeding with respect to the indenture or for any remedy only if:
 
·
                  
the Holder has previously given the trustee written notice of a continuing event of default with respect to that series,
 
·
                  
the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made a written request of, and
offered reasonable indemnification to, the trustee to begin the proceeding,
 
·
                  
the trustee has not started the proceeding within 60 days after receiving the request, and
 
·
                  
the trustee has not received directions inconsistent with the request from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities of that series during those 60 days.  (Section 507)
 
However, the Holder of any debt security will have an absolute right to receive payment of principal of and any premium and interest on the debt security
when due and to institute suit to enforce this payment.  (Section 508)
 
Defeasance
 
Defeasance and Discharge.  
At the time that we establish a series of debt securities under the indenture, we can provide that the debt securities of that
series are subject to the defeasance and discharge provisions of the indenture.  If we so provide, we will be discharged from our obligations on the debt
securities of that series if we
deposit with the trustee, in trust, sufficient money or Government Obligations, as defined below, to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other
sums due on the debt securities of that series, such as sinking fund payments, on the dates these payments are due under the indenture and the terms of the
debt securities.  (Section 403) As used above, “ 
Government Obligations
 ” mean:
 
·
                  
securities of the same government which issued the currency in which the series of debt securities are denominated and/or in which interest is
payable, or
 
·
                  
securities of government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the government.  (Section 101)
 
In the event that we deposit funds in trust and discharge our obligations under a series of debt securities as described above, then:
 
·
                  
the indenture will no longer apply to the debt securities of that series, except for the obligations to compensate, reimburse and indemnify the
trustee, to register the transfer and exchange of debt securities, to replace lost, stolen or mutilated debt securities and to maintain paying
agencies and the trust funds; and
 
·
                  
Holders of debt securities of that series can only look to the trust fund for payment of principal, any premium and interest on the debt securities
of that series.  (Section 403)
 
Under federal income tax law, that deposit and discharge may be treated as an exchange of the related debt securities for an interest in the trust mentioned
above.  Each holder might be required to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between:
 
·
                  
the holder’s cost or other tax basis for the debt securities, and
 
·
                  
the value of the holder’s interest in the trust.
 
Holders might be required to include in income a share of the income, gain or loss of the trust, including gain or loss recognized in connection with any
substitution of collateral, as described in this section under the heading “—Substitution of Collateral” below.
 
 
Defeasance of Covenants and Events of Default.  
At the time that we establish a series of debt securities under the indenture, we can provide that the debt
securities of that series are subject to the covenant defeasance provisions of the indenture.  If we so provide and we make the deposit described in this
section under the heading “—Defeasance and Discharge” above:
 
·
                  
we will not have to comply with the following restrictive covenants contained in the indenture:  Consolidation, Merger or Sale or Lease of
Property as Entirety (Sections 801, 803, 804); Restrictions on Secured Debt (Section 1008); Maintenance of Properties (Section 1005);
Payment of Taxes and Other Claims (Section 1007); Restrictions on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions (Section 1009); Classification of
Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries (Section 1010); and any other covenant we designate when we establish the series of debt securities;
and
 
·
                  
we will not have to treat the events described in the fourth bullet point under the heading “—Events of Default” as they relate to the covenants
listed above that have been defeased and no longer are in effect and the events described in the fifth, sixth and seventh bullet points under the
heading “—Events of Default” as events of default under the indenture in connection with that series.
 
In the event of a defeasance, our obligations under the indenture and the debt securities, other than with respect to the covenants and the events of default
specifically referred to above, will remain in effect.  (Section 1501)
  
If we exercise our option not to comply with the covenants listed above and the debt securities of that series become immediately due and payable because
an event of default has occurred, other than as a result of an event of default specifically referred to above, the amount of money and/or Government
Obligations on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due on the debt securities of that
series, such as sinking fund payments, on the date the payments are due under the indenture and the terms of the debt securities, but may not be sufficient to
pay amounts due at the time of acceleration.  However, we would remain liable for the balance of the payments.  (Section 1501)
 
Substitution of Collateral.  
At the time that we establish a series of debt securities under the indenture, we can provide for our ability to, at any time,
withdraw any money or Government Obligations deposited pursuant to the defeasance provisions described above if we simultaneously substitute other
money and/or Government Obligations which would satisfy our payment obligations on the debt securities of that series pursuant to the defeasance
provisions applicable to those debt securities.  (Section 402)

such Participant’s target annual incentive compensation amount for such Plan Year (allocated among each of the applicable
performance metrics) by the payout percentage corresponding to the performance of the relevant business unit or the
Company for such Plan Year, as determined under the Plan’s payout formula described in Exhibit A hereto.    For those
Participants selected by the Plan Administrator, this amount may be adjusted up or down to reflect the individual performance
or circumstances of such Participant during such Plan Year (as determined by the Plan Administrator in its discretion).  The
performance of the Company and its business units for each Plan Year shall be determined by the Company in good faith,
subject to such adjustments as the Committee may approve in its discretion to recognize circumstances which it believes to
warrant special consideration.  Subject to any such adjustments approved by the Committee, the Company’s determination of
its performance and the performance of its business units for purposes of this Plan will be final, conclusive and binding on all
persons interested in the Plan.
6.
Payments of Annual Incentive.
All annual incentive compensation under this Plan shall be paid in the form of cash or in the form of shares of 3M stock,
restricted stock or restricted stock units delivered pursuant to the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan and/or its
successor (subject to such restrictions as shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion).  All annual incentive
payments for a Plan Year shall be completed no later than March 15 of the year following the end of such Plan Year.
7.
Plan Administration.
This Plan will be administered by the Plan Administrator; provided, however, that actions of the Plan Administrator with
respect to individuals who are not Section 16 Officers shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the Committee.  The
Plan Administrator will have full power and authority to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules, forms or
procedures as she deems
2
necessary for the proper administration of the Plan, and to take any other action as she deems necessary or advisable in
connection with the Plan.  With respect to Participants who live in or are subject to taxation in one or more countries other
than the United States, the Plan Administrator may modify the provisions or operation of the Plan to enable it to comply with
the provisions of applicable laws or regulations or to accommodate the applicable tax rules and laws.  Any decision made,
action taken or interpretation made by the Plan Administrator that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan will be
final, conclusive and binding on all persons interested in the Plan.
8.
Amendments.
The Committee may at any time amend, modify or terminate this Plan, in whole or in part. 
9.
Rights of Participants.
Nothing in this Plan or the fact that a person has received or become eligible to receive annual incentive compensation
hereunder shall be deemed to give such person any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or to interfere with the
right of the Company to discipline or terminate the employment of such person at any time for any reason whatsoever.  No
person shall have any claim or right to receive annual incentive compensation under this Plan, except as provided in
accordance with the provisions of this Plan and as approved by the Plan Administrator.    Unless otherwise specifically
determined by the Company, the annual incentive compensation earned under this Plan will not be deemed a part of any
Participant’s compensation for purposes of determining such Participant’s payments or benefits under any Company benefit
plan, severance program or severance pay law of any country.  This Plan will be unfunded.  The Company will not have any
obligation to set aside funds or segregate assets to ensure the payment of any annual incentive compensation earned
hereunder.  This Plan will not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person.
10.
Changes in Employment Status.
If a Participant’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than death or Retirement, participation in this
Plan will end and any annual incentive compensation that would otherwise have been payable to such Participant for the Plan
Year in which such termination occurs shall be cancelled (unless the Plan Administrator determines, in his, her or its
discretion, that the Plan should pay all or a portion of such annual incentive compensation despite such termination).  A
Participant who participates in the Plan for only part of a Plan Year (whether due to being newly hired, transferred to a new
position, a  job reclassification,  a leave of absence, a termination of employment or any other reason) may receive prorated
annual incentive compensation for such Plan Year, as determined by the Plan Administrator in his, her or its discretion.  A
Participant who participates in the Plan for a full Plan Year but who experiences one or more changes in positions or business
units during such Plan Year will be entitled to receive adjusted annual incentive compensation for such Plan Year, based on
such prorations as shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in his, her or its discretion. The estate of a Participant who
dies during a Plan Year or after the end of a Plan Year but prior to receiving payment for such Plan Year shall be entitled to
receive either prorated annual incentive compensation or the full unreduced annual incentive compensation for such Plan
Year, as determined by the Plan Administrator in his, her or its discretion.  A Participant who Retires from employment with
the Company during a Plan Year or after the end of a Plan Year but prior to receiving payment for such Plan Year shall be
entitled to receive either prorated annual incentive
3
compensation or the full unreduced annual incentive compensation for such Plan Year, as determined by the Plan
Administrator in his, her or its discretion.
11.
Clawback Provisions.
The gross amount of all payments actually or constructively received by a Participant under the Plan will be subject to
recoupment by the Company to the extent required to comply with applicable laws, the rules of any securities exchange or
automated quotation system on which the shares of the Company’s common stock are then listed, quoted or traded, or any
policy of the Company providing for the reimbursement of incentive compensation.
12.
Withholding.
All payments of annual incentive compensation made pursuant to this Plan will be subject to withholding for all applicable
taxes and contributions required by law to be withheld therefrom.
13.
No Assignment.
No right or interest of a Participant under this Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or subject to the claims of any creditor
or to any liens.
14.
Successors.
All obligations of 3M under this Plan with respect to the payment of annual incentive compensation will be binding upon any
successor to 3M, regardless of the reason or circumstances for such succession (whether by reason of merger, consolidation or
the purchase of substantially all of the business and assets of 3M).
15.
Validity.
In the event any provision of this Plan should be determined to be illegal or invalid for any reason, it shall not affect the
remaining provisions of the Plan which shall remain in effect as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included
herein.
16.
Governing Law.
The provisions of this Plan shall be governed by, and interpreted and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware,  disregarding the choice-of-law principles thereof.

3M EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN
SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION
Effective Date:  February 3, 2020
I.
Introduction
The purpose and intent of this 3M Executive Severance Plan (“Plan”) is to provide separation benefits to certain eligible employees of 3M Company
(“3M”) or an affiliate of 3M participating in the Plan (each, a “Participating Employer”) who are involuntarily discharged from employment other than for
Misconduct or who voluntarily terminate employment for Good Reason.  
This Plan does not provide separation benefits for individuals discharged
from employment for Misconduct, for individuals who voluntarily terminate employment without Good Reason or for individuals whose
employment is terminated by the Company pursuant to a mandatory retirement policy adopted by the board of directors of 3M (the “Board”).
This is the summary plan description (“SPD” or “Summary”) for the Plan.  It describes the terms of the Plan as in effect for individuals whose termination
of employment and Benefits Approval Date (as defined in Section ​II.A below) occur on or after the effective date specified above.  This Summary, together
with any separate amendments and other documents, is also the official plan document for the Plan.
To fully understand your benefits, it is important that you read this entire Summary carefully and understand it and your responsibilities.  If you elect to
participate, one of your responsibilities is to timely provide an executed General Release of All Claims in a form provided by a Participating Employer
(“Release”).  Failure to follow the terms of the Plan or satisfy any Plan requirements can result in loss of eligibility or delay, reduction or termination of
benefits.  You should keep this Summary for future reference.
Depending on your individual situation, you may be eligible for other types of employee benefits and/or retirement benefits following termination of
employment under other employee benefit and/or retirement plans.  Consult the plan documents for those other plans for a description of those other
benefits.
You will notice certain terms and/or phrases are capitalized throughout this Summary. These terms and/or phrases are important, and you should remember
them. The capitalized terms and phrases are either defined in the Summary or in the other document to which they relate.
Neither the receipt of this Summary nor its use of the term “you” indicates that you are eligible to participate in the Plan or receive benefits under the
Plan.  Only those individuals who satisfy the eligibility requirements and other criteria contained in the Plan are eligible to participate in the Plan.
The information in this Summary may not be relied on as tax advice for any purpose.  3M does not guarantee any specific tax consequences.  Ultimately, it
is your responsibility to determine the tax treatment of the payments and benefits provided under this Plan.  For information on how applicable tax law may
apply to your personal situation, consult your own qualified tax advisor.
Neither the terms of the Plan nor the benefits provided under the Plan shall be a term of employment of any individual. This Summary and the Plan shall not
be deemed an employment contract.  Participation in the Plan does not constitute a guarantee of employment or alter the “at-will” nature of your
employment.
3M hereby advises and encourages you to speak with an attorney regarding the provisions in this Summary and the Release. 
II.
Eligibility and Required Documents
A.
 
Persons Who Are Eligible
Except as described below in Section ​II.B, you are eligible to participate in this Plan only if:
·
you are classified by a Participating Employer as a regular, U.S.
 
employee of such Participating Employer and a common law employee for
employment tax purposes;
·
you are an employee at the job grade L2 level (or equivalent) or above;
·
your employment with your Participating Employer is involuntarily terminated by the Participating Employer (other than for Misconduct or
pursuant to a mandatory retirement policy adopted by the Board) or you voluntarily terminate your employment with your Participating
Employer for Good Reason, in each case, on or after the Effective Date, and your eligibility for severance benefits under this Plan (subject to all
other eligibility requirements) 
 
has been reviewed and confirmed by: (i) the compensation committee of the Board, if you are the Chief Executive
Officer of 3M; (ii) the Chief Executive Officer of 3M, if you are the Senior Vice President, Human Resources; and (iii) the Senior Vice
President, Human Resources, if clauses (i) and (ii) are inapplicable to you (provided, however, that the Senior Vice President, Human
Resources, may specify one or more alternate approvers for individuals covered by this clause (iii)).  References in this Summary to an
individual’s “Benefits Approval Date” mean the date on which the approval required in accordance with this provision is obtained with respect to
such individual;
·
you sign and return the Release by the latest of: (i) your separation date; (ii) the date that is 45 days after the date that you receive a copy of this
Summary and the Release; or (iii) the date that is specified in writing by an authorized representative of a Participating Employer;
·
you do not rescind the Release, and the Release becomes effective, irrevocable and enforceable; and
·
you separate employment on the date determined by 3M (other than for voluntary terminations for Good Reason).  
3M has discretion to
determine your actual separation date and to change your separation date (other than for voluntary terminations for Good Reason)
.
The classification of an individual by a Participating Employer is final, conclusive and binding for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate in this Plan and shall be made solely in the discretion of the Participating Employer.  No reclassification or determination of a
person’s status with a Participating Employer, for any reason, without regard to whether it is initiated by a court, governmental agency or
otherwise and without regard to whether or not the Participating Employer agrees to such reclassification or determination, shall make the
person retroactively or prospectively eligible for benefits.  However, the Participating Employer, in its sole discretion, may reclassify a
person as benefits eligible on a prospective basis.  Any uncertainty regarding an individual’s classification will be resolved by excluding the
person from eligibility.
Employees who satisfy all of the Plan’s eligibility requirements and receive benefits under the Plan are referred to as “Plan Participants” throughout this
Summary.
B.
 
Persons Who Are Ineligible
Even if you otherwise meet the eligibility requirements above, you are not eligible to receive benefits under this Plan if:
·
you cease to work prior to the date that your services are no longer required by 3M (other than for voluntary terminations for Good Reason);
·
you provide notice of your intent to terminate employment with 3M (including by reason of retirement, but excluding any good faith notice of
intent to voluntarily resign for Good Reason);
·
you are an employee of a 3M affiliate that is not a Participating Employer;
·
you are employed by a Participating Employer established outside of the United States and you do not have a primary work location in the
United States at the time you receive notice of termination or, if applicable, at the time you provide a good faith notice of intent to voluntarily
resign for Good Reason;
·
you are an employee below the job grade L2 level (or equivalent);
·
you are classified or treated by a Participating Employer as a leased employee, independent contractor, contingent worker, service worker,
consultant, contract worker, agency worker, freelance worker, shared employee or a person other than a common law employee, regardless of
your actual legal status;
·
your compensation is not reported on a Form W-2 issued by a Participating Employer;
·
you are covered by a contract or other written agreement that provides that you are not eligible for benefits under the Plan;
·
you are on long-term disability or other inactive employment status;
·
you are on a leave of absence (other than an inactive leave) or short-term disability, unless you return to work, separate employment and sign the
Release by the date required by 3M and satisfy all other eligibility requirements of this Plan;
·
you are discharged for Misconduct, as determined by 3M;
·
your employment by a Participating Employer is terminated as a direct result of a merger, acquisition, sale, spin-off or other divestiture,
involving a business, line of business, business unit, or other identifiable business group of 3M or a 3M affiliate that does not result in a Change
in Control of 3M, except and to the extent that 3M, in its sole discretion, declares certain such employees eligible (3M reserves the right to
declare certain such employees eligible while excluding other such employees); provided that you must satisfy all other eligibility requirements
of this Plan;
·
you are eligible for a separation-related payment or benefits under any applicable law, plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding of any
nature in exchange for a release of, or the termination of, any employment-related claims you may have against your Participating Employer; or
·
you are offered and accept another position within 3M or a 3M affiliate prior to your separation date.
C.
Required Documents – Release
You must sign and return the Release, and the Release must become effective, irrevocable and enforceable, in order to be eligible to receive the
payments and benefits described in Section ​III.C  (Severance Pay), Section ​III.D  (VIP Vesting), Section ​III.E  (Stock Options and SARs), Section ​III.F
 (Restricted Stock Units), Section ​III.G  (Performance Shares), and Section ​III.H  (Outplacement Benefits). You have at least 45 days from receipt to
sign and return the Release, but the Release cannot be signed before your separation date.  This means that your deadline for signing and returning the
Release will be the latest of: (i) your separation date; (ii) the date that is 45 days after the date that you receive a copy of this Summary and the Release;
or (iii) the date that is specified in writing by an authorized representative of a Participating Employer.  If your separation date occurs before the 45
 day
(or such later date as may be authorized for you), you may use the entire period to consider whether to sign the Release, or you may voluntarily sign the
documents on or after your separation date but before the deadline to return the Release has passed.  The completed and signed Release should be sent
to:  3M Human Resources – Transitions Administration, 3M Center, 224-2W-15, St. Paul, MN 55144.
D.
Certain Definitions
For purposes of this Plan, the following definitions have the following meanings:
·
“Change in Control” has the same meaning as such term is defined in the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2016 LTIP”) or
any successor thereto.
·
“Good Reason” means, with respect to a voluntary termination: (i) if the voluntary termination occurs within 18 months
 
following a Change in
Control of 3M (each such period, a “CIC Window Period”), (a) a material diminution in your position, authority, duties or responsibilities as in
effect immediately prior to the Change in Control of 3M, (b) a material diminution in your base salary or annual planned cash compensation, or
(c) a material change in the geographic location at which you are required to perform services for your Participating Employer; or (ii) if the
voluntary termination occurs at any time other than during a CIC Window Period, (a) a material diminution in your base salary or annual planned
cash compensation
 
 without your consent, other than an across-the-board reduction that applies to all comparable positions, or (b) a change in
excess of 100 miles in the primary work location at which you are required to perform services for your Participating Employer without your
consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination (other than a termination that occurs within 18 months following a Change in Control of
3M) will not be treated as a voluntary termination for Good Reason for purposes of this Plan unless you provide written notice to 3M of the
existence of the circumstances providing grounds for termination for Good Reason within 30 days of the initial existence of such grounds and 3M
has had at least 30 days from the date on which such notice is provided to cure such circumstances. If you do not terminate your employment for
Good Reason within 60 days after the first occurrence of the applicable grounds, then you will be deemed to have waived your right to terminate
for Good Reason with respect to such grounds.
·
“Misconduct” means (i) your willful failure to substantially perform your duties (other than a failure resulting from your disability); (ii) your
willful failure to carry out, or comply with any lawful and reasonable directive of the Board or your immediate supervisor; (iii) the occurrence of
any act or omission by you that could reasonably be expected to result in (or has resulted in) your conviction, plea of no contest, plea of nolo
contendere, or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony or indictable offense or crime involving moral turpitude; (iv) your
commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty against 3M or any of its subsidiaries or
th
affiliates or any of their officers, directors, employees, customers, suppliers, insurers or agents; (v) your material breach of any material provision
of any written agreement with 3M or any subsidiary; (vi) any action (or inaction) by you that 3M reasonably determines constitutes gross
negligence or misconduct in the performance of your duties and responsibilities; or (vii) any other intentional misconduct by you that significantly
affects the business or affairs of 3M or any subsidiary in an adverse manner.
III.
Provisions Applicable to Plan Participants
A.
Future Service with 3M
If you become a Plan Participant, you may not apply for or accept employment with, or provide services to, 3M or any 3M affiliate in any
capacity (including, but not limited to, as a regular or temporary employee, consultant, independent contractor, or contract worker) for a
period of six months following your separation date. 
B.
Final Paycheck
Regardless of whether you become a Plan Participant, your final pay will be paid to you separately from any severance or retirement payment you may
receive. 
C.
 
Severance Pay
If you become a Plan Participant, you will receive severance pay at the time and in the amount set
forth in the Schedule provided to you and applicable to your position; provided, however, that your
right to severance pay will cease in the event you become reemployed by 3M.  Severance pay does not
qualify for voluntary deductions (
e.g.
, General Employees Stock Purchase Plan, VIP) and is subject to
all applicable Federal (including FICA), state, and/or local taxes in effect at the time of payment,
as well as all legally required withholdings (
e.g.
, tax levy, garnishment).
 
 
D.
 
 
VIP Vesting
If (1) you are employed by a Participating Employer that participates in the VIP, (2) you are a participant in the VIP, and (3) you become a Plan
Participant, then your Company Contribution Account will be fully vested even if you do not have the required years of vesting service as of your
separation date.
E.
 
Stock Options and SARs
 
If you become a Plan Participant, each outstanding vested option and stock appreciation right (“SAR”) issued to you under the 3M 2008 Long
‑
Term
Incentive Plan, the 2016 LTIP or any successor thereto (collectively, the “LTIP”) will remain outstanding and will not terminate 90 days after your
termination of employment solely as a result of your separation from 3M.   The remaining terms and conditions of your stock options and SARs will
continue to apply, including, without limitation and if applicable, the terms and conditions providing for the termination of your stock options or SARs
in the event of your violation of any applicable non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality obligations. In no event will your stock options or
SARs remain exercisable beyond the expiration of their maximum term.  Unless otherwise provided pursuant to the existing terms and conditions of the
applicable plan under which the stock option or SAR was granted and the applicable award agreement (see Section 
​IV
 below), any stock options or
SARs that are unvested as of your termination of employment will be forfeited in accordance with their terms. 
F.
 
Restricted Stock Units
If you become a Plan Participant, a portion of each annual restricted stock unit award issued to you under the LTIP that remains unvested at the time of
your termination of employment will vest on an accelerated basis.  The number of additional restricted stock units that vest will be determined by
multiplying the total number of restricted stock units subject to each vesting tranche of your award by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the
number of whole years of employment service you have completed since the award’s grant date and the denominator of which will be the number of
years of employment service required to vest in the restricted stock units subject to that tranche pursuant to the otherwise applicable service-based
vesting schedule.  If you previously vested in one or more restricted stock units subject to the award, the number of restricted stock units that vest on an
accelerated basis will be reduced on a one-for-one basis by the number of previously vested restricted stock units.  The Shares underlying the restricted
stock units that vest pursuant to this Section ​III.F will be issued as soon as administratively practicable following the date on which your release
becomes effective and irrevocable (but in any event no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which your termination of
employment occurs) or, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, at such time as the shares otherwise would
have been issued in accordance with the terms of your award.  In no event will any restricted stock unit awards granted to you for recognition, retention
or other special purposes be subject to the special
accelerated vesting provisions of this Section ​III.F.    Unless otherwise provided pursuant to the existing terms and conditions of the applicable plan
under which the restricted stock units were granted and the applicable award agreement (see Section ​IV below), any restricted stock units that are
unvested as of your termination of employment will be forfeited in accordance with their terms.
G.
 
Performance Shares
If you become a Plan Participant, each outstanding performance share issued to you under the LTIP will vest in accordance with the applicable vesting
schedule and will not be forfeited solely as a result of your separation from 3M, provided that the target number of performance shares with respect to
any award shall be prorated based on the number of whole calendar months you worked during the applicable performance period and the performance
shares that may vest will be subject to actual performance results and paid at the same time as for other then-active LTIP participants.
H.
 
Outplacement Benefits
If you become a Plan Participant, you will be eligible to receive reasonable outplacement services, as determined by 3M in accordance with its
outplacement services policy in effect as of the date of your termination of employment.
 
IV.
 
Impact on Other Company Plans, Programs and Arrangements
Unless otherwise provided herein, the terms and conditions of each benefit plan, program or arrangement in which you participate as of the
date of your termination of employment will govern with respect to the effect of your termination of employment under such plan, program or
arrangement.  In some cases, you may be eligible to receive additional benefits under such other plans, programs or arrangements whether
or not you become a Plan Participant.  For example, outstanding equity awards issued to you under the LTIP (including performance share
awards) may continue to vest and/or, if applicable, remain exercisable beyond the standard post-termination exercise period (but in no event
beyond the expiration date of such option) if your termination of employment qualifies as a “retirement” for purposes of the relevant award or
you experience a qualifying termination of employment following a change in control.  For further information on the consequences of your
employment status change, as well as the definition of “retirement” for purposes of your outstanding equity awards, please refer to the
resource list included in your severance packet for contact information.
V.
Claims Procedure
If you believe you are entitled to benefits, or you disagree with a decision regarding your benefits, you should file a claim with the Plan
Administrator in accordance with the Plan’s claim procedures. If you do not file a claim or follow the claim procedures, you are giving up
important legal rights.  Before commencing legal action to recover benefits, or to enforce or clarify rights, you must completely exhaust the
Plan’s claim procedures.
A.
How to File a Claim. 
To make a claim, you must file a written statement with the Plan Administrator.  You should include the facts and arguments that you want
considered in deciding your claim.  The Plan Administrator must receive actual delivery of your written claim within 60 days after the date
you knew or reasonably should have known of the facts behind your claim or, if earlier, the date of your separation.
Within 90 days of the date the Plan Administrator receives your claim, you will receive either a notice of the decision or a notice describing
the need for additional time (up to 90 additional days) to reach a decision.  If the Plan Administrator notifies you that it needs additional
time, the notice will describe the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which it expects to reach a decision.  If the
Plan Administrator denies your claim, in whole or in part, you will receive a notice specifying the reasons, the Plan provisions on which it is
based, a description of additional material (if any) needed to perfect the claim, your right to file a civil action under section 502(a) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), if your claim is denied upon review, and it will also explain your
right to request a review.
B.
How to File an Appeal. 
If the Plan Administrator denies your claim, you must file a written request to have the denial reviewed. Your request should include the
facts and arguments that you want considered in the review.  The Plan Administrator must receive actual delivery of your written request
for review within 60 days after the date that you received notice that your claim was denied.  You may submit written comments,
documents, records, and other information relating to your claim.  Upon request you are entitled to receive free of charge reasonable
access to and copies of the relevant documents, records, and information used in the claims process.
Within 60 days after the date the Plan Administrator receives your request for review, you will receive either a notice of the decision or a
notice describing the need for additional time (up to 60 additional days) to reach a decision.  If the Plan Administrator notifies you that it
needs additional time, the notice will describe the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which it expects to reach
a decision.  If the Plan Administrator affirms the denial of your claim, in whole or in part, you will receive a notice specifying the reasons,
the Plan provisions on which it is based, notice that upon request you are entitled to receive free of charge reasonable access to and
copies of the relevant documents, records, and information used in the claims process, and your right to file a civil action under section
502(a) of ERISA.
If the Plan Administrator determines it needs further information to complete its review of your denied claim, you will receive either a
written or electronic notice describing the additional information necessary to make the decision.  You will then have 60 days from the date
you receive the notice requesting additional information to provide the requested information to the Plan Administrator.  The time between
the date the Plan Administrator sends its request to you and the date the Plan Administrator receives the requested additional information
from you does not count against the 60-day period in which the Plan Administrator has to decide your claim on review.  If special
circumstances exist, this period may be further extended.
C.
Deadline to Commence a Lawsuit.
If you wish to bring a lawsuit over your claim, you must file your claim within the required time, complete the entire claim procedures,
receive a denial from the Plan Administrator after you request a review, and commence that suit within 30 months after you knew or
reasonably should have known of the facts behind your claim or, if earlier, within 6 months after the claim procedures are completed.
VI.
Important Plan Information
A.
Plan Administrator
The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary power and authority to:
·
control and manage the operation of the Plan;
·
prescribe applicable Plan procedures;
·
make all decisions and determinations with respect to the Plan; and
·
interpret and apply the terms of the Plan. 
This discretionary power and authority includes, without limitation:
·
determining all factual and legal questions;
·
interpreting any ambiguous or unclear terms in the Plan and the underlying documents;
·
deciding eligibility for coverage and eligibility for benefits; and
·
establishing rules to carry out administration of the Plan. 
All determinations, interpretations, rules and decisions of the Plan Administrator will be made, in its sole discretion, and will be final,
conclusive and binding as to all parties.  In any legal action, all explicit and all implicit determinations by the Plan Administrator shall be
afforded the maximum deference permitted by law.  The Plan Administrator may delegate all or a portion of its powers, authority,
responsibilities, discretion and rights under the Plan to an individual, entity or committee.  Any delegation may allow further delegation by
the individual, entity or committee to whom the delegation has been made.
The Plan Administrator reserves the right to correct any errors, defects, inconsistencies and omissions that may occur in the administration
of the Plan as the Plan Administrator, in its discretion, determines appropriate. This includes reducing or eliminating benefits under the
Plan, and such correction shall be final, conclusive and binding all persons.  Subject to any delegation of authority, the Plan Administrator
shall be the named fiduciary for the purposes of ERISA.
B.
Enforceable Release Required; Repayment.
If all or any portion of the Release is held to be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, or you commit an act of
Misconduct, 3M will have the right (but not the obligation) to (i) declare the Release void in its entirety, (ii) cease
providing any payment or benefit otherwise owing to you under the Plan and (iii) require you to repay any and all cash severance
previously paid to you under the terms of the Plan to the extent permitted by applicable law.
C.
Amendment or Termination of Plan
3M reserves the right to modify, amend and terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time and in any respect and for any reason and
either prospectively or retroactively or both.  3M's right to modify, amend or terminate the Plan includes, without limitation:
·
changes in the eligibility requirements;
·
cost-sharing and funding arrangements; and
·
benefits provided and termination of all or a portion of the coverage provided under the Plan.
No oral statements or representations can amend the Plan.  3M makes no promise to continue the Plan or the benefits offered under the
Plan in the future, and individuals have no vested right to the Plan or the benefits offered under the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or termination of the Plan that would reduce benefits or eliminate one or more participant’s
eligibility may take effect if adopted during the period beginning 6 months prior to a Change in Control of 3M or 18 months following a
Change in Control of 3M without the written consent of the participant(s) whose benefits or eligibility would be reduced or eliminated.
D.
Funding
Benefits provided under the Plan are paid out of the general assets of 3M.
    
An individual does not, by virtue of participating in the Plan, have any
interest in any specific asset or assets of 3M.  With respect to benefits funded out of 3M’s general assets, an individual’s rights shall be solely those of an
unsecured general creditor of 3M.
E.
Governing Law
The Plan shall be construed in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code; and, to the extent not preempted by Federal law, in
accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.  Any litigation commenced or arising in connection with the Plan shall be commenced and venued
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.
F.
 
Section 409A of the Code
The payments and benefits provided under this Plan are intended to be exempt, to the greatest extent possible, from the requirements of section 409A of
the Code, and this Plan will be construed and implemented accordingly.  To the extent a payment or benefit provided under this Plan is not so exempt,
this Plan and the payments and benefits to be provided hereunder are intended to, and will be construed and implemented so as to, comply in all respects
with the applicable provisions of section 409A of the Code.  Any right to receive installment payments under this Plan shall be treated as a right to
receive a series of separate payments. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you are a “specified employee” (as determined by 3M in accordance with section 409A of the Code)
as of the date of your “separation from service” (as determined by 3M in accordance with section 409A of the Code), and if any payment, benefit or
reimbursement to be paid or provided under the Plan to you both (i) constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of and subject to section
409A of the Code and (ii) cannot be paid or provided in a manner otherwise provided herein without subjecting you to additional tax, interest and/or
penalties under section 409A of the Code, then any such payment, benefit or reimbursement that is otherwise payable during the first six (6) months
following your separation from service shall be paid or provided to you in a lump sum on the earlier of (x) your death and (y) the first business day of the
seventh month immediately following your separation from service.
3M makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under the Plan comply with section 409A of the Code and in no event shall 3M be
liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Plan Participant on account of noncompliance
with section 409A of the Code. To the extent required by section 409A of the Code, any payments to be made to a Plan Participant upon his or her
termination of employment shall only be made upon such Plan Participant's separation from service.
G.
Recovery of Overpayment; Recoupment
If a benefit payment to you or on your behalf exceeds for any reason the benefit amount you are entitled to receive in accordance with the terms of the
Plan, the Plan Administrator has the right to require the return of the overpayment on request, and upon request you must immediately refund the
overpayment as well as help the Plan Administrator obtain the refund of the overpayment from another person or entity.
The Plan Administrator’s right to recover overpayments applies regardless of the cause, nature or source of the overpayments, and includes any
overpayment resulting from retroactive awards received from any source, fraud or any error made in processing your claim.  The Plan Administrator also
has the right, at its option and to the extent consistent with section 409A of the Code, to recover the overpayment by reducing or offsetting against any
future benefit payments.  Such rights do not affect any other right of recovery the Plan Administrator may have with respect to such overpayment.  In
addition, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to obtain the overpayment by any other method permitted by the law.  The Plan Administrator will
determine, in its sole discretion, the method by which the repayment of the overpayment shall be made.  Failure to repay an overpayment and cooperate
with the Plan Administrator in collecting an overpayment may result in loss of coverage under the Plan.
In addition, any benefit payment under the Plan will be subject to recoupment by 3M to the extent required to comply with applicable law or 3M’s
clawback policy, as in effect at the time your employment is terminated.
H.
Assignment Prohibited
You shall not have the right to transfer any interest, benefit, right or claim you may have under this Plan, including a claim for benefits, for breach of
fiduciary duty, to receive documents or information, to file a lawsuit, or any other claim or right you may have under this Plan to any party.  Nor shall
you have the power to anticipate, alienate, assign, sell, transfer, pledge or encumber the same.
The Plan shall not recognize an assignment of any interest, benefit, right or claim you may have under this Plan, either in whole or in part.  Any attempt
to assign any interest, benefit, right or claim under this Plan shall be void and non-enforceable.
Benefits under this Plan shall not be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution following judgment or other legal process.  Except as may be
required by law, your benefits and rights under the Plan are not subject to the claims of your creditors.
I.
 
Section 280G
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any other plan, arrangement or agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments or benefits received
or to be received by you (including, without limitation, any payment or benefits received in connection with a Change in Control or your termination of
employment, whether pursuant to the terms of this Plan or any other plan, arrangement, or agreement, or otherwise) (all such payments collectively
referred to herein as the “280G Payments”) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of section 280G of the Code and would, but for this
Section ​VI.I, be subject to the excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then prior to making the 280G Payments, a
calculation shall be made comparing (i) the Net Benefit (as defined below) to you of the 280G Payments after payment of the Excise Tax to (ii) the Net
Benefit to you if the 280G Payments are limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax.  If the amount calculated under clause
(i) above is less than the amount under clause (ii) above, the 280G Payments will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion
of the 280G Payments is subject to the Excise Tax. For purposes of this Section VI.I, “Net Benefit” shall mean the present value of the 280G Payments
net of all Federal, state, local, and foreign income, employment, and excise taxes. Any reduction made pursuant to this Section VI.I shall be made in a
manner determined by 3M that is consistent with the requirements of section 409A of the Code.  If two economically equivalent amounts are subject to
reduction but are payable at different times, the amounts shall be reduced (but not below zero) on a pro rata basis.
    
All calculations and determinations
under this Section ​VI.I shall be made by an independent accounting firm or independent tax advisor appointed by 3M (the “Tax Advisor”) whose
determinations shall be conclusive and binding on 3M and you for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations and determinations required by
this Section ​VI.I, the Tax Advisor may rely on reasonable, good faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of section 280G and
section 4999 of the Code. 3M and you shall furnish the Tax Advisor with such information and documents as the Tax Advisor may reasonably request in
order to make its determinations under this Section ​VI.I.  3M shall bear all costs the Tax Advisor may reasonably incur in connection with its services.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Statement of Rights
About your ERISA Rights
As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA.  ERISA provides that all Plan participants will be entitled to
the information as described in this section.
Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits
.  ERISA provides that all Plan participants will be entitled to:
·
Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator’s office and at other specified locations, such as work sites, all documents governing the
Plan, including insurance contracts, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of
Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) at:
Public Disclosure Room
Employee Benefits Security Administration
U.S. Department of Labor
200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20210.
·
Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan, including insurance
contracts and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description (“SPD”).  The Plan Administrator
may make a reasonable charge for the copies.
·
Receive a summary of the Plan’s annual financial report.  The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy
of this summary annual report.
Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries
.  In addition to creating rights for Plan participants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible
for the operation of the employee benefit plan.  The people who operate your Plan, called “fiduciaries” of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in
the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries.  No one, including your employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise
discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.
Enforce Your Rights
.  If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain
copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.
Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.  For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report
from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to
provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the
control of the Administrator.  If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court
after exhausting the Plan’s claim and appeal procedure. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan’s money, or if you are discriminated
against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court.  If you file suit
against the Plan, the court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to
pay these costs and fees.  If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.
Assistance with Your Questions
.  If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.  If you have any questions
about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should
contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA), U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the
Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries
Employee Benefits Security Administration
U.S. Department of Labor
200 Constitution Avenue N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20210.
You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by:
·
Contacting the publications hotline of the EBSA at (866) 444-3272;
·
Logging on to the Internet at dol.gov/ebsa; or
·
Contacting the EBSA field office nearest you.
 
Schedule A to the 3M Executive Severance Plan
Severance Pay for the Chief Executive Officer
If you become a Plan Participant by signing the Release and satisfying all other eligibility requirements, you will receive the severance
payments described below.
1.
Continued payment of the annual base salary you otherwise would have earned if you remained employed through the date that
is twenty-four (24) months following your separation date (the “Severance Period Expiration Date”), payable in accordance with
3M’s regular payroll practices, with the first such payment commencing sixty (60) days following your separation date, subject
to Section ​VI.F of the Plan.
1.
Continued payment of all Annual Incentive Plan payments that you otherwise would have been entitled to receive if you
remained employed by 3M through the Severance Period Expiration Date.  In the event the Severance Period Expiration Date
occurs prior to the completion of an Annual Incentive Plan measurement year, you will receive a prorated amount for such year
based on the number of calendar days in such year preceding the Severance Period Expiration Date.  The amount of each Annual
Incentive Plan payment (or prorated payment) to which you may become entitled will be calculated in accordance with the terms
of the Annual Incentive Plan based on actual results for the relevant Annual Incentive Plan measurement year.  For purposes of
calculating such payments, your performance rating for the year of termination shall be the final performance rating shown for
you in 3M’s human resources management system on the last day of the applicable measurement year (or, if no such
performance rating is assigned to you for such year, a performance rating of “fully meets expectations” or equivalent) and for
each year thereafter, if any, your performance rating shall be a rating of “fully meets expectations” or equivalent.  Each Annual
Incentive Plan payment (or prorated payment) will be distributed to you no later than March 15 of the year following the relevant
Annual Incentive Plan measurement year.
Note:  If you participate in the Annual Incentive Plan
 
and you retire (within the meaning of the Annual Incentive Plan), you may be
eligible to receive a prorated amount of the Annual Incentive Plan payment that otherwise would have been payable to you for the
year of your retirement, regardless of whether you become a Plan Participant.  The prorated amount for which you may be eligible,
however, would be calculated based on the number of days worked prior to your separation date (i.e., without regard to the
additional period between your separation date and the Severance Period Expiration Date).
In calculating the benefits described above, your annual base salary and target Annual Incentive Plan payment will be your annual base
salary and target Annual Incentive Plan payment as in effect on your separation date (or if you voluntarily terminate for Good Reason as a
result of a material diminution in your base salary or annual planned cash compensation, your annual base salary and target Annual
Incentive Plan payment as in effect immediately prior to any such material diminution). 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the cash payments and benefits provided to you pursuant to items 1 and 2 of this Schedule
shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis but not below $0, any payments you may otherwise become entitled to under your applicable
Employee Agreement, provided that such reduction shall be applied consistent with section 409A of the Code.
 
 
Schedule B to the 3M Executive Severance Plan
Severance Pay for Corporation Operations Committee Members (other than the Chief Executive Officer)
If you become a Plan Participant by signing the Release and satisfying all other eligibility requirements, you will receive the severance
payments described below.
1.
Continued payment of the annual base salary you otherwise would have earned if you remained employed through the date that
is eighteen (18) months following your separation date (the “Severance Period Expiration Date”), payable in accordance with
3M’s regular payroll practices, with the first such payment commencing sixty (60) days following your separation date, subject
to Section ​VI.F of the Plan.
2.
Continued payment of all Annual Incentive Plan payments that you otherwise would have been entitled to receive if you
remained employed by 3M through the Severance Period Expiration Date.  In the event the Severance Period Expiration Date
occurs prior to the completion of an Annual Incentive Plan measurement year, you will receive a prorated amount for such year
based on the number of calendar days in such year preceding the Severance Period Expiration Date.  The amount of each Annual
Incentive Plan payment (or prorated payment) to which you may become entitled will be calculated in accordance with the terms
of the Annual Incentive Plan based on actual results for the relevant Annual Incentive Plan measurement year.  For purposes of
calculating such payments, your performance rating for the year of termination shall be the final performance rating shown for
you in 3M’s human resources management system on the last day of the applicable measurement year (or, if no such
performance rating is assigned to you for such year, a performance rating of “fully meets expectations” or equivalent) and for
each year thereafter, if any, your performance rating shall be a rating of “fully meets expectations” or equivalent.  Each Annual
Incentive Plan payment (or prorated payment) will be distributed to you no later than March 15 of the year following the relevant
Annual Incentive Plan measurement year.
Note:  If you participate in the Annual Incentive Plan
 
and you retire (within the meaning of the Annual Incentive Plan), you may be
eligible to receive a prorated amount of the Annual Incentive Plan payment that otherwise would have been payable to you for the
year of your retirement, regardless of whether you become a Plan Participant.  The prorated amount for which you may be eligible,
however, would be calculated based on the number of days worked prior to your separation date (i.e., without regard to the
additional period between your separation date and the Severance Period Expiration Date).
In calculating the benefits described above, your annual base salary and target Annual Incentive Plan payment will be your annual base
salary and target Annual Incentive Plan payment as in effect on your separation date (or if you voluntarily terminate for Good Reason as a
result of a material diminution in your base salary or annual planned cash compensation, your annual base salary and target Annual
Incentive Plan payment as in effect immediately prior to any such material diminution). 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the cash payments and benefits provided to you pursuant to items 1 and 2 of this Schedule
shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis but not below $0, any payments you may otherwise become entitled to under your applicable
Employee Agreement, provided that such reduction shall be applied consistent with section 409A of the Code.
