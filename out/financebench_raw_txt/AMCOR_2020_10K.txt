PART I
Item 1. - Business
The Company
        Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a holding company originally incorporated un der the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July
2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company , Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and be came a public limited company
incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.
Bemis Company, Inc. Merger
        On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. (" Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products, pursuant to  the definitive merger agreement (the
"Agreement") between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6, 2018. Unde r the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor s hares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor
shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument ("CDI") for each sh are of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of t he transaction, the Amcor shares were
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and tra ded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "AMCR" and the CDI's re presenting our shares on the
Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") are traded under the symbol "AMC."  In addition, Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares  were delisted from the NYSE.
        
Business Strategy
Strategy
        Our strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differen tiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global pac kaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are
determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the enviro nment.
Focused portfolio
        Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:
• A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,
• good industry structure,
• attractive relative growth, and
• multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and o ther competitive advantages.
        These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesse s we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty carto ns, and closures.
Differentiated capabilities
        " The Amcor Way" describes the capabilities deployed consistentl y across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Ta lent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership,
Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.
Shareholder value creation
        Through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabiliti es we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently creat e superior customer value. The defensive nature of
our end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relative ly low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time value creati on has been strong and consistent through paying dividends
and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end ma rkets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareho lders via share buybacks.

Segment Information
        Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," estab lishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financi al statements. In applying the criteria set
forth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flex ible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons,
and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a ra nge of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin Am erica, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to
Note 20, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial sta tements for financial information about reporting segments.
Flexibles Segment
        The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packag ing globally. With approximately 40,000 employees at 181 principal m anufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2020, the
Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic , aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2020, Fle xibles accounted for approximately 78% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.
Rigid Packaging Segment
        The Rigid Packaging Segment manufacturers rigid packaging containe rs and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2020, the Rigid Pa ckaging Segment employed approximately 6,000
employees at 50 principal manufacturing facilities in 11 countries.  In fiscal year 2020, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 22% of th e Company’s consolidated net sales.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition
        Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but prima rily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America,
Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service  to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is su pported by product development engineers, design
technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service o rganization.
        We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020. Sales to PepsiCo, and it s subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1% and 11.0%
of our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Business arrang ements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contrac ts in disparate locations and any change in these
business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time.
         The major markets in which we sell our products historically have be en, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition inclu de service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors
include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc ., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, Internat ional Paper
Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Hol dings Inc., Sonoco Products Company and WestRock Company, and a variety of pri vately held companies.
        We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the marke ts in which we serve; however, due to the diversity of our business, our prec ise competitive position in these markets is not
reasonably determinable.
Backlog
        Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to busi ness volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain invent ory levels that provide a reasonable balance between
obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly  fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a
significant factor in the industries in which we operate.
Raw Materials
        Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and ch emicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchase d from a variety of global industry sources, and we are
not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While t emporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw
material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currentl y, raw materials are readily available but pricing may fluctuate.
7
Intellectual Property
        We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and other count ry patents and patent applications that relate to our products, man ufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a
number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States a nd in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as  trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks
collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss o f any single patent or license alone would not have a material advers e effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our
reporting segments. Patents, patent applications and license agreeme nts will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accorda nce with their terms or otherwise.
Sustainability, Innovation and Environmental Laws and Regulations
        We believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made b y Amcor. Packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products , and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of
products. It extends shelf life and reduces food
and other product loss across a range of distribution channels. Consumers wa nt cost effective, convenient and easy to use packaging which also ha s an end of life solution to reduce waste. We believe
responsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consu mer participation.
        Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as b eing integral to our success. In January 2018, we became the first global  packaging company pledging to develop all of our
packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increa se our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater re cycling of packaging around the world.
        We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have th ousands of active patents. We collaborate with customers, suppliers,  and innovators to create industry-leading solutions, and
with stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste colle ction, sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the enviro nmental implications of their packaging. We are uniquely
positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. Addressing the need for and increasing th e supply of responsible packaging is one of the
most important growth opportunities for Amcor.
        Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad e nvironmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These l aws and regulations pertain to the discharge of
certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as vari ous other protections of the environment. We believe that
we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental la ws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Heal th, and Safety Management System and regular audits of
those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certai nty that we will not in the future, incur liability, with respect to noncompl iance with environmental laws and regulations due to
contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (incl uding contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or t he off-site disposal of regulated materials,
which could be material. In addition, these laws and regulations are cons tantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes . Refer to Note 19, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for informatio n about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the va rious laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A.
"Risk Factors".
Employees
        As of June 30, 2020, we employed approximately 47,000 people worldwide, with approximately 42% of those employees being covered by collecti ve bargaining agreements. Our relations with
employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfac tory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor dispute s during the past three years. For more on collective
bargaining and labor disputes, see "Item 1A - Risk Factors."
Seasonal Factors
        The business of each of the reporting segments is not seasonal to any material extent.
Research and Development
        Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to c onsolidated financial statements for information about our research and dev elopment expenditures and policies.

Item 1A. - Risk Factors
        The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Ann ual Report on Form 10-K, or in other filings by the Company with the Securiti es and Exchange Commission, could
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial position, re sults of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or, that we presently believe are not material, could also
affect our business operations and financial results.
Strategic Risks
Changes in Consumer Demand — We are exposed to changes in consumer  demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industr ies.
        Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sa les made by our customers to consumers. Consequently, changes in con sumer preferences for products in the industries that
we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered , whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, envi ronmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result
in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescenc e of some of our existing products. Although we have adopted certain strat egies designed to mitigate the impact of declining
sales, there is no guarantee that such strategies will be succe ssful or will offset a decline in demand. Furthermore, any new products tha t we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to
many factors, including our inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develo p products that meet consumer demand in a timely
and cost-effective manner.
        Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in inc reased demand for other products we produce. However, to the extent changing pre ferences are not offset by demand
for new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences could have an a dverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and resu lts of operations.
Key Customers and Customer Consolidation — The loss of key cus tomers, a reduction in their production requirements or consolida tion among key customers could have a significant adverse
impact on our sales revenue and profitability.
        Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success, parti cularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply c hoices available to customers. From time to time, a
single customer, depending on the current status and volumes of a n umber of separate contracts in disparate locations, may account for 10%  or more of our revenue. Sales to our largest customer
accounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019  and 2018. We did not have sales to a single customer that exceede d 10% of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other
customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in these fiscal  periods.
        Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain b usiness units. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any si gnificant reduction in their production
requirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements  with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit.
        There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future  seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors, cha nge to alternative forms of packaging, begin
manufacturing their packaging products in-house or seek to renew the ir business with us on terms less favorable than before.
        Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer rela tionships could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow,  financial condition and results of operations, which
effect may be material.
        In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired c ompanies with similar or complementary product lines. This conso lidation has increased the concentration of our business
with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pre ssure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total  volume of products purchased or the elimination of a
price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acqu ired. While we have generally been successful at managing customer c onsolidations, increased pricing pressures from our
customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operat ions.
Competition — We face significant competition in the industries a nd regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our bus iness.
        We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas , each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures and competitiv e behavior. We regularly bid for new and continuing
business in the industries and regions in which
10
we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand. W e cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competit iveness.
        The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of busine ss on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our opera ting results. In addition, our competitors may
develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations tha t could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential cu stomers. No assurance can be given that the actions of
established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effe ct on our ability to implement our plans and on our business, cash flow , financial condition and results of operations.
Expanding Our Current Business — We may be unable to expand our curren t business effectively through either organic growth, including product in novation, or acquisitions.
        Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our exist ing operations, particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand rela tionships with customers in emerging markets, product
innovation, and expansion through acquisitions. However, we may not be ab le to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outsi de our control. Our ability to grow organically may be
limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locati ons in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth pla ns due to changing economic conditions, strategic
priorities or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on p roduct innovation, new product development and timely responses to c hanging consumer demands and preferences.
Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to c hanging consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potentia l, affect our competitive position and
adversely affect our business and results of operations.
        Additionally, over the past decade, we have pursued growth through ac quisitions, including our acquisition of Bemis in 2019. There can be n o assurance that we will be able to identify suitable
acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the rig ht participation strategy in the future, or to complete such acquisiti ons on acceptable terms or at all. Other companies in the
industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment a nd acquisition strategies to us, resulting in competition for a limit ed pool of potential acquisition targets. Due in part to that
competition, as well as the recent low interest rate environment, whi ch has made debt funding more appealing and accessible, price multip les for potential targets are currently higher than their
historical averages. If, as a result of these and other factors, we are unable  to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria  and close such transactions on acceptable terms, our potential
for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an a dverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting
expected financial benefits.
Integration — We may face challenges with integrating acquisi tions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition.
        We may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our ex isting operations. These challenges could include difficulty in  integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and
challenges with integrating the business cultures. In addition, the proce ss of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal bus iness operations.
        We generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savin gs and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions. For e xample, we expect the Bemis acquisition in 2019 will
generate estimated pre-tax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately $180 million from procurement, manufactu ring and general and administrative efficiencies. While
we are currently on track to achieve the targeted Bemis synergi es, we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realiz ed or current savings will be sustained. If we are not able to
successfully integrate our acquisitions and achieve the expected s ynergy cost savings, the anticipated benefits of the transaction m ay not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than
expected or involve more costs to do so.
Intellectual Property — Challenges to or the loss of our intellectual p roperty rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to c ompete effectively.
        Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to  protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed inte llectual property. We own a number of patents on
our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufact uring, and we own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and tra de name rights used in connection with the
packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products. We also rely on  trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology. W e attempt to protect and restrict access to our
intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the pat ent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which  we operate, as well as non-disclosure agreements.
However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information wi thout our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or b reach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with
us. Furthermore, many of
11
the countries in which we operate, particularly the emerging market s, do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights a s fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in
which we operate, such as the United States and the European Union. T he use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authoriza tion could reduce certain of our competitive
advantages, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business. Similarly, while we
have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesti ng that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights, there c an be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in
the future. If we were held liable for a claim of infringement, we could be required  to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain produc ts. Intellectual property litigation, which
could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of m anagement, may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary te chnology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of
the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprie tary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsu ccessful, we may not be able to obtain any
necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Failure to protect ou r patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have  an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial
condition and results of operations.
Operational Risks
Global Health Outbreaks — Our business and operations may be adver sely affected by the recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") out break or other similar outbreaks.
        Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by  outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the recent outbreak of the  coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China in
December 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, governmental autho rities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and c onstantly evolving measures to try to contain the
virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gathering s, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Measures provi ding for business shutdowns generally exclude
essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the es sential services. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our ope rations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing
essential services. However, we have experienced volatility in cust omer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could co ntinue to experience significant volatility in the demand
for our products in the future. We have also impaired an equity method inves tment by $25.6 million in the fourth quarter, in part, partially due to gen eral market declines associated with the
pandemic. See Note 7, "Equity Method Investments" of the notes to consol idated financial statements for further information regarding the impairmen t.
        The outbreak has in the past, and could in the future result in the temp orary closure of our facilities, the facilities of our suppliers, or other vend ors in our supply chain. In limited cases to date,
certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities, which has impacted their d emand, and we may continue to experience the volatility in
demand from temporary customer shutdowns. In addition, the coronavirus ha s significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and fina ncial markets of affected countries, including
negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of ca pital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The c oronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn,
such as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending, busi ness shutdowns, or economic recessions, which could negatively af fect demand for our customers’ products. Despite our efforts to
manage these impacts, the extent to which the coronavirus or other out breaks impact our business and operations, including our ability to s ecure financing at attractive rates, is unknown and the effect
could be material.
Global Operations — Challenging current and future global economic condi tions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our busines s operations and financial results.
        Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our p ackaging products, including packaged food, beverage, healthcare, personal  care, agribusiness, industrial, and
other consumer goods. As a result, general economic downturns in our key geograph ic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operatio ns and financial results. The current global
economic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployme nt in certain areas in which we operate, low economic growth and dif ficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and
related economic volatility in certain economies, are likely to c ontinue to put pressure on the global economy and our business. The CO VID-19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies.
        When challenging economic conditions exist, our customers may  delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payme nt or fail to pay us altogether. Suppliers may have
difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty gettin g our products to customers, which may affect our ability to meet customer d emands, and result in a loss of business. Weakened
global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins. All of these fact ors could have an adverse effect on our business,
cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effe ct may be material.
12
        Political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic c onditions in one or more markets in which we operate. For example, the Un ited Kingdom's exit from the European Union has
resulted in uncertainty regarding the long-term nature of the United King dom’s relationship with the European Union, causing significant volatil ity in global financial markets and altering the conduct
of market participants. Political developments such as this co uld potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers
and employees, and adversely impact profitability.
International Operations — Our international operations subject us t o various risks that could adversely affect our business operatio ns and financial results.
        We have operations throughout the world, including facilities loc ated in emerging markets. In fiscal year 2020, approximately 74% of our sale s revenue came from developed markets and 26%
came from emerging markets. We expect to continue to expand our ope rations in the future, particularly in the emerging markets.
        Management of global operations is extremely complex, particularly gi ven the often substantial differences in the cultural, political an d regulatory environments of the countries in which we
operate. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate, including Arge ntina, Brazil, China and India and other emerging markets, have underdevelo ped or developing legal, regulatory or
political systems, which are subject to dynamic change and civi l unrest.
        The profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by, am ong other things:
• changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes;
• changes in, or difficulties in interpreting and complying with, lo cal laws and regulations, including tax, labor, foreign investment and  foreign exchange control laws;
• nullification, modification or renegotiation of, or difficulties or del ays in enforcing, contracts with clients or joint venture partners that a re subject to local law;
• reversal of current political, judicial or administrative policies e ncouraging foreign investment or foreign trade, or relating to the use of loc al agents, representatives or partners in
the relevant jurisdictions;
• pandemics, such as COVID-19, impacting various regions of the world unequa lly; or
• changes in exchange rates and inflation, including hyperinflation,  which may be further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Further, sustained periods of legal, regulatory or political instabil ity in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adve rse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and
results of operations, which effect may be material.
        The international scope of our operations, which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to cert ain economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of
Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the Australian De partment of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other applicable national and s upranational organizations (collectively,
‘‘Sanctions’’), and operations in certain countries that are from time to time s ubject to Sanctions, also requires us to maintain internal processes a nd control procedures. Failure to do so could result in
breach by our employees of various laws and regulations, including those rela ting to money laundering, corruption, export control, fraud, bribery, insider trading, antitrust, competition and economic
sanctions, whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise . Any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition a nd result in reputational damage to our business,
which effect may be material.
Raw Materials — Price fluctuations or shortages in the availabil ity of raw materials, energy and other inputs could adversely affect our  business.
        As a manufacturer of packaging products, our sales and profitability are d ependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and o ther inputs, including energy. All of the raw
materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films, inks and solvents, aluminum and fiber-b ased carton board. Prices for these raw materials
are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control  due to factors such as changing economic conditions, pandemics  (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), currency and commodity price
fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather co nditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability , and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Increases in
costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results . Although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategie s, including by entering into contracts with certain customers
which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw materi al costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increas es in raw
13
material costs, there is no guarantee that we will be able to antici pate or mitigate commodity and input price movements, there may be d elays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw
material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against s uch movements could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financ ial condition and results of operations, which effect may
be material. 
Commercial Risks — We are subject to production, supply and other c ommercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may  be exacerbated in times of economic downturn.
        We face a number of commercial risks, including (i) operational disru ption, such as mechanical or technology failures or forced closures due to pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic),
each of which could, in turn, lead to production loss and/or increased cost s, (ii) shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and (iii) risks
associated with development projects (such as cost overruns and del ays). In addition, many of the geographic areas where our production is locat ed and where we conduct business may be affected by
natural disasters, including earthquakes, snowstorms, hurricanes, forest fi res and flooding. Any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities wou ld likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that
could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it e xperienced the downtime.
        Supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chain, including as a res ult of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occu r related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other natural
disasters, could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw mate rials, equipment and other supplies, and in turn, adversely impact ou r ability to supply products to our customers. Such
disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial res ults. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain
facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing and temporary  screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations. These measures may not be sufficient to
prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restricti ons, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively imp act our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution
or other business activities.
        Additionally, the insolvency of, or contractual default by, any of our c ustomers, suppliers and financial institutions, such as banks and i nsurance providers, may have a significant adverse effect
on our operations and financial condition. Such risks are exacerbated i n times of economic volatility (such as economic volatility ca used by the COVID-19 pandemic), either globally or in the
geographies and industries in which our customers operate. If a counterparty  defaults on a payment obligation to us, we may be unable to collect t he amounts owed and some or all of these
outstanding amounts may need to be written off. If a counterparty becomes i nsolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in conne ction with a particular project, we may need to find a
replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or, alternatively, fulfi ll those obligations ourself, which is likely to be more expensive. The oc currence of any of these risks, including any default by our
counterparties, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flo w, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may  be material and result in a competitive disadvantage.
Information technology — A failure or disruption in our information technology  systems could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, em ployee, vendor and other data and could
negatively affect our business.
        We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our informati on technology and control systems to securely manage operations and  various business functions, and on various
technologies to process, store and report information about our business, an d to interact with customers, vendors and employees around the world. In addi tion, our information systems increasingly
rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures. The se measures cover technical changes to our network security, organiza tion and governance changes as well as alignment of third
party vendors on market standards. As with all large systems, our inform ation technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disrupti on, information loss or shutdown due to power outages,
failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, hardware failure s, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events, telecommun ications failures, user errors, unauthorized access
and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functiona lity.
        We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidentia l or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and sec urity laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to
protect such information, our facilities and systems and those of our cust omers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches , misplaced or lost data and programming
and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confident ial or personal data or information. Information system damages, disruptions , shutdowns or compromises could result in
production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors, los s of customers and business opportunities, violation of privacy laws a nd legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or
intervention, negative publicity resulting in reputational damage , reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs, any of which cou ld have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow,
financial condition and results
14
of operations, which affect may be material and result in a competiti ve disadvantage. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by em ploying a number of measures, our systems, networks,
products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and pe rsistent threats.
Attracting and retaining key personnel — If we are unable to attr act and retain key personnel, we may be adversely affected.
        Our continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to iden tify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key func tions and geographic areas. Losing the services of key
employees in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our o bjectives. There can be no assurance we will be able to recruit, train, ass imilate, motivate and retain employees in the future
who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture.
Operational hazards — We are subject to costs and liabilities re lated to current and future environmental and health and safety l aws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.
        We are required to comply with environmental and health and safety  laws, rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do bu siness. Many of our products come into contact with
the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products . Compliance with these laws and regulations can require
significant expenditure of financial and employee resources.
        In addition, changes to such laws, regulations and standards a re made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, mi ght, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in
the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an  increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plast ic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators
in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider bann ing or limiting certain packaging formats or materials. Additionally, in creased regulation of emissions linked to climate
change, including greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions and other climate -related regulations, could potentially increase the cost of our op erations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not
be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of fossil fuel  inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. How ever, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot
predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses t hat would be necessary for compliance.
        Federal, state, provincial, foreign and local environmental requirem ents relating to air, soil and water quality, handling, discharge, st orage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate
change are also significant factors in our business and changes to suc h requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operati ons. We may be found to have environmental liability for the
costs of remediating soil or water that is, or was, contaminated b y us or a third party at various facilities we own, used or operate (inclu ding facilities that may be acquired by us in the future). Legal
proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well a s mandated remediation programs, that require substantial, and in s ome instances, unplanned capital expenditure.
        The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may a dversely affect our business. A number of governmental bodies have introduce d, or are contemplating introducing, regulatory
change to address the impacts of climate change, which, where implem ented, may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results .
        We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, fines, pena lties and legal costs relating to environmental matters, and costs  relating to the damage of natural resources, lost property
values and toxic tort claims. Provisions are raised when it is considered  probable that we have some liability. However, because the extent of pot ential environmental damage, and the extent of our
liability for such damage, is usually difficult to assess and may o nly be ascertained over a long period of time, our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the
currently provisioned amount. Accordingly, additional charges could  be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and finan cial position, which may be material.
Labor disputes — We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, whic h could adversely affect our business.
        Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in rece nt years, there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disp utes in the future, including protests and strikes,
which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on ou r business and results of operation. Although we consider our relations wi th our employees to be good, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working rela tionship with our employees in the future.
15
Financial Risks
LIBOR Indexed Borrowings — The expected phase out of LIBOR could impact t he interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our  interest expense to increase.
        A substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a va riable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). In July 2017 , the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct
Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to p hase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction wit h the Alternative Reference Rates
Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial ins titutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Finan cing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by
short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.
        Certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist , we may need to renegotiate some financing
agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in det ermining the interest rate. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest
rate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be  available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchm ark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of
such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial co ndition, and results of operations.
Exchange Rates — We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk.
        We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk, both transactional a nd translational, which may negatively affect our financial performance. T ransactional foreign exchange exposures result from
exchange rate fluctuations, including in respect of the U.S. dollar, the Eu ro, and other currencies, including in Latin America, in which our costs are de nominated, which may affect our business input
costs and proceeds from product sales. Translational foreign exchange e xposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of ent ity functional currencies to U.S. dollars, consistent with
our reporting currency, and may affect the reported value of our assets and li abilities and our income and expenses. In particular, our translationa l exposure may be impacted by movements in the
exchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the U .S. dollar. The exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subj ect to further movement.
        Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidl y. For instance, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian Real have experien ced significant pressures as growth and other concerns,
including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have weighed on the Me xican and Brazilian economies, respectively. In addition, we have re cognized foreign exchange losses related to the
currency devaluation in Argentina and its designation as a highly infl ationary economy under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Poli cies" of the notes to consolidated financial
statements for further information regarding highly inflationary accoun ting.
        To the extent currency devaluation continues across our business , we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dol lar-denominated input costs across our business, which
would adversely impact our margins and profitability. As such, we ma y be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations c ould have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow,
financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be mate rial.
Interest rates — An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.
        Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and ha ve an adverse impact on results of operations. Accordingly, increases in s hort-term interest rates will directly impact the amount
of interest we pay. Refer to Note 13, "Debt," of the notes to consolidated fi nancial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings and  interest rates.
Credit rating — A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our b orrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition an d results of operations.
        In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue co mmercial paper, drawdown bank loans and issue long-term bonds to me et our funding needs. Credit rating agencies rate
our debt securities on many factors, including our financial results, thei r view of the general outlook for our industry, and their view of the general outlook  for the global economy. Actions taken by
the rating agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the  current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade . If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, or
place us on a watch list, the impacts could include reduced acces s to the commercial paper market, an increase in the cost of our borrowing s or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or an
increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the ca pital markets.
16
Refer to "Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Con dition and Results of Operations," "Liquidity and Capital Reso urces," for more information on our credit rating profile.
Hedging — Failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations  in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively im pact our results of operations.
        We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with  borrowing on a floating-rate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in fo reign exchange rates. Our board of directors has
approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates. T he level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time an d we may elect to change our hedging policy at any
time. If our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate ri sk and foreign exchange rate risks, if we are under-hedged or if a hedge provi der defaults on their obligations under hedging
arrangements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, cas h flow, financial condition and results of operations.
Goodwill and other intangible assets — A significant write-down of g oodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse  effect on our reported results of operations and net
worth.
        As of June 30, 2020, we had $7.3 billion of goodwill and other intangible  assets. We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using t he business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current acco unting standards. These methods include the use of a
discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future ca sh flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, ex pected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill
and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cas h charge against results of operations to write down these assets fo r the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes
in our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pan demic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or
intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced ne t operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge wou ld have a material adverse effect on our reported results of
operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangible  assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate. See "Item 7. - Ma nagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations," "Critical Accounting Estimate s and Judgments," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Internal Controls — If we fail to maintain an effective system of interna l control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to a ccurately report our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confi dence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
        As a newly listed NYSE public company in 2019, we elected the transi tion period for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. S ection 404 requires us to furnish a report by
management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal con trol over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclos ure of any material weaknesses identified by our
management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weak ness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal cont rol that results in more than a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial state ments will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation
from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectivene ss of our internal control over financial reporting. However, during our tran sition period, we were exempt from Section 404
compliance until we filed our second Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fisc al year ended June 30, 2020 (which is this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
        Amcor Limited was required to comply with reporting obligations in Australia including the preparation of its financial statemen ts under Australian Accounting Standards ("AAS") as adopted by
the Australian Accounting Standards Board and other relevant companies la w. Amcor Limited was not required to comply with U.S. GAAP. Following t he consummation of the Bemis acquisition, we
now prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting duri ng the conversion of our historical AAS
financial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropria te level of experience in technical accounting
in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. W e have fully remediated this material weakness as of the end of fiscal year 2020, see "Item 9A, Controls and
Procedures," for further information.
        We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficie ncies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal control s over the period end financial reporting process. Specifically,
we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that co nflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems  used in the preparation and reporting of financial information.
17
        We are currently in the process of remediating the second material weakn ess through a process to (i) develop and implement additional controls a nd procedures to reduce the number of
segregation of duties conflicts within key IT systems, which includes t he implementation of new security roles and the automation of se gregation of duties monitoring where practical, (ii) design and
implement additional compensating controls where necessary and (ii i) develop training on segregation of duties. Given that we operate many ERP sy stems globally, this effort has targeted the largest
locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expand ed to other locations in fiscal 2021. We believe that these enhan ced resources and processes, including the implementation of
new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the second mate rial weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered re mediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period
of time and we have concluded, through testing, that these controls a re designed and operating effectively.
        Failure to remediate the material weakness described above at a ll or within our expected timeframe, or any newly identified material weakn esses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a
misstatement of our financial results, lead to a loss of investor confide nce and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock .
Insurance — Our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insu rance company, may not provide adequate protection against al l of the risks we face.
        We seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures t hrough the purchase of insurance. A significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with third-
party re-insurers. Our policies with such third-party re-insurers cover propert y damage and business interruption, public and products liability and dire ctors' and officers' liability. Although we believe
the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry pra ctice, they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no gu arantee that any claims made under such policies will
ultimately be paid.
        Additionally, we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a capti ve insurance company, Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd, which is located in Singa pore. Our captive insurance company collects
annual premiums from our business groups, and assumes specific risks re lating to property damage, business interruption and liability clai ms. The captive insurance company may be required to
make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captive's reserve s, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financia l condition and results of operations.
Legal and Compliance Risks
Litigation — Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely a ffect our business operations and financial performance.
        We are, and in the future will likely become, involved in lawsuits , regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings aris ing out of the ordinary course of our business. Given
our global footprint, we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regul atory environment. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regul atory inquiries, and governmental and other legal
proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible ou tcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse j udgments or settlements, either of which could require
substantial payments. In addition, actions we have taken or may tak e, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19  pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation
against us. Refer to "Item 3. - Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report o n Form 10-K.
Environmental, health, and safety regulations — Changing governme nt regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters may adver sely affect our company.
        Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passe d and anticipated in response to concerns about Greenhouse Gas emissions a nd climate change. We are a manufacturing entity that
utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products . Increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in hig her costs for us in the form of higher raw material
cost, as well as energy and freight costs. It is possible that certain m aterials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. We  could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring
and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits. Additionally, a siz able portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and b everage packaging, both highly regulated
markets. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Patents and proprietary technology — Our success is dependent on o ur ability to develop and successfully introduce new products an d to develop, acquire and retain intellectual property rights.
        Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rel y on intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and  trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and
licensing arrangements, to establish our
18
proprietary rights. If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, our c ompetitive position may suffer. Our pending patent applications , and our pending trademark registration
applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the  validity or scope of our patents or trademarks. In addition, our patents, trade marks and other intellectual property rights may not
provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may need to s pend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights. O ur competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect
infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at al l. Competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intel lectual property rights or by developing non-infringing
competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries whic h could make it easier for competitors to capture market share
and could result in lost revenues.
Risks Relating to Being a Jersey, Channel Islands Company Listing Ordina ry Shares
Our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of Jersey, Channel Isl ands, which may not provide the level of legal certainty and tran sparency afforded by incorporation in a U.S. jurisdiction
and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other U.S. corporations.
        We are organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British cro wn dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy,  France. Jersey is not a member of the European
Union. Jersey, Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is lar gely based on English corporate law principles. The rights of holde rs of our ordinary shares are governed by Jersey law, including
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and by the Amcor Articles of As sociation, as may be amended from time to time. These rights differ in som e respects from the rights of other
shareholders in corporations incorporated in the United States. Further, t here can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect
investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principl es in the U.S., which could adversely affect the rights of investors.
U.S. shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against  us.
        A significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States and several of our directors and officers are citizens or resid ents of jurisdictions outside of the United States. As a
result, it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a cla im within the United States upon those non-U.S. directors and officers, or to e nforce judgments realized in the United States.
        Judgments of U.S. courts may not be directly enforceable outside o f the U.S. and the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts outside of the U.S., inclu ding those in Australia and Jersey, may be
subject to limitations. Investors may also have difficulties pursu ing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the  U.S., including Australia and Jersey, for liabilities under the
securities laws of the U.S. Additionally, our Articles of Association provid e that while the Royal Court of Jersey will have non-exclusive juris diction over actions brought against us, the Royal Court
of Jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder a ctions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers , actions arising out of Companies (Jersey) Law
1991, as amended, or actions asserting a claim against our directors  or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The exclusive forum p rovision would not prevent derivative shareholder
actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being  raised in a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from asserting juris diction over such claims. However, there is
uncertainty whether a U.S. or Jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum prov ision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claim s.

Overview
        Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packa ging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care,  and other products.  Amcor works with
leading companies around the world to protect their products and the peop le who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains th rough a range of flexible and rigid packaging,
specialty cartons, closures, and services. The company is focused on maki ng packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusab le, and made using an increasing amount of recycled
content. During fiscal year 2020, approximately 47,000 Amcor employees  generated $12.5 billion in sales from operations that spanned approxima tely 231 locations in over 40 countries. 
Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented
Impact of COVID-19
        The 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") has introduced a period of unprece dented uncertainty and challenge. Amcor’s operations have been l argely recognized as 'essential' by governments
and authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chai ns for critical food and healthcare products. Our scale and global footpri nt has enabled us to collaborate with customers and
suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to se rvice our customers. In dealing with the exceptional challenges pos ed by COVID-19, we have established three guiding principles
focusing on the health and safety of our employees, keeping our operations runni ng and contributing to relief efforts in our communities.
Health and Safety
        Our commitment to the health and safety of its employees remai ns our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation o f global and regional response teams that
maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage t he situation, restrictions on company travel, quarantine protocols for emp loyees who may have had exposure or have symptoms,
frequent disinfecting of Amcor locations and other measures designed to he lp protect employees, customers and suppliers. We expect to continu e these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is
adequately contained for our business.
Operations and Supply Chain
        To support our business partners, we have instituted business c ontinuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which add ress infection prevention measures, incident response,
return to work protocols and supply chain risks. We have experienced mini mal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deem ed as providing essential services. However, we have
experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second hal f of fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant vola tility in the demand for our products in the future. For instance,
in April, our Rigid Packaging Segment sales volumes in North America and La tin America were adversely impacted as a result of a decrease in foot traffi c in the convenience and on-the-go channels.
Our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated cl osure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expe ct that our operations will remain operational given the
essential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to con tain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that signific ant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic, including
temporary closures of our facilities.
        We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply ch ain to date and continue to monitor the risk of customer, raw mat erial and other supply chain disruptions.
Contributions to Our Communities
        To support our local communities, we launched a global progra m to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by donating food and healthcare packaging products and by funding local community
initiatives to improve access to healthcare, education or food and  other essential products.
Looking Ahead
        We believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of the  COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot reasonably estimate the durat ion and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact
on the global economy and our operations and financial results. The ult imate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across
the supply chain, the duration of social distancing measures and o ther government imposed restrictions and the nature and pace of macroeco nomic recovery in key global economies.

The Acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc.
        On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstandi ng shares of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexibl e packaging products based in the United
States, for the purchase price of $5.2 billion in an all-stock transacti on. In connection with the Bemis transaction, we assumed $1.4 billion of debt.
2019 Bemis Integration Plan
        In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, we initiated restructuri ng activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and opt imizing the combined organization. As previously
announced, we continue to target realizing approximately $180 million o f pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and adm inistrative savings by the end of fiscal year
2022.
        Our total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are e xpected to be approximately $200 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integra tion Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring
and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90  million in employee related expenses, $25 million in
fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 mi llion in restructuring related expenses. We estimate that approxima tely $150 million of the $200 million total integration
costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2 020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were
payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Be mis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporat e and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year
2022.
        Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restruc turing activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration cos ts
are not linked to restructuring. We believe the disclosure of restructuring  related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemi s Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs
relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to rep lace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipa ted loss on sale of closed facilities.
Other Restructuring Plans
        On August 21, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Pac kaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint.
The Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headco unt reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization a nd productivity improvements as well as overhead cost
reductions.
        Our total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main co mponent being the cost to exit manufacturing
facilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has bee n increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal y ear 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash impairments.
We estimate that approximately $70 million of the $110 million t otal costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fis cal year 2020 were $23.6 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging
Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021.
        On June 9, 2016, we announced a major initiative ("2016 Flexibles Re structuring Plan") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growt h in the Flexibles segment. This initiative was
designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization withi n developed markets through footprint optimization to better ali gn capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the cost
base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity,  particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to  market.
        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, we had closed eight  manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facili ties. Our total pre-tax restructuring costs were $230.8
million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 m illion in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other co sts, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment
and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million  of the $230.8 million in total program costs resulted in cash expenditures . Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4 million.
The Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019.
26
Impairment in Equity Method Investment
        Due to impairment indicators present for the years ended June 30, 202 0, 2019 and 2018, we performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value  of its investment in AMVIG Holdings
Limited ("AMVIG") at the end of each period, including interim periods, to  the fair value of the investment, which was determined based on AMVIG's qu oted share price. We recorded impairment
charges in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $25.6 million, $14.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, as the fair value of the investment was below its carrying value. Refer to Note 7, "Equity
Method Investments" for more information about our equity method investme nts.
Highly Inflationary Accounting
        We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a func tional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine e conomy was designated as highly inflationary for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting  the financial results of our Argentinean subsidiaries with a functi onal currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional
currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. The transition to highl y inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact of $27.7 mill ion and $30.2 million that was reflected on the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectivel y.

profit of the total Company with a full year of Bemis’ results having bee n included compared to three weeks in fiscal year 2019.
        The effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2020 reduced relative to 20 19 mainly due to the decrease in non-deductible transaction costs rel ated to the acquisition of Bemis. The current year
effective tax rate is reflective of a greater proportion of the business i n the U.S. as a result of the Bemis acquisition.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
        This Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to financial measures that have not b een prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally ac cepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP"): adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") fro m continuing operations, adjusted net income from continuing operation s, and net debt. These non-GAAP financial
measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These mea sures exclude the impact of significant tax reform, certain amounts rela ted to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates,
acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equi pment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation and the write-down o f equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses
on sales of significant property and divestitures, certain litigati on matters, pension settlements and certain acquisition-related exp enses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses,
professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory , order backlog, intangible amortization, and changes in the fair value of d eferred acquisition payments.
        This adjusted information should not be construed as an alterna tive to results determined under U.S. GAAP. Management of the Company uses the n on-GAAP measures to evaluate operating
performance and believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to en able investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of current  and historical performance of the Company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
        We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by ope rating activities, commercial paper, borrowings from banks and procee ds from issuances of debt and equity. We
periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in l ight of market conditions, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, expec ted future cash flows, potential funding requirements for
debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost o f capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the i mpact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of
access to funding sources.
        Based on our current and expected cash flow from operating activities and available cash, we believe our cash flows provided by operating activi ties, together with borrowings available under
our credit facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity t o fund our operations, capital expenditures and other commitments, inclu ding dividends, into the foreseeable future.
Overview
Year Ended June 30,
(in millions) 2020 2019 Change 2020 vs. 2019
Cash flow from operating activities $ 1,384.2 $ 776.1 608.1 
Cash flow from investing activities 37.9 10.2 27.7 
Cash flow from financing activities (1,236.4) (764.9) (471.5)
Cash Flow Overview
        Cash Flow from Operating Activities
        Net cash inflows provided by operating activities increased by $608.1 mi llion, or 78.4%, to $1,384.2 million for fiscal year 2020, from $776.1 million fo r fiscal year 2019. This increase was
primarily due to impacts from the Bemis acquisition.
        Cash Flow from Investing Activities
        Net cash inflows provided by investing activities increased by $27.7 million, or 271.6%, to $37.9 million for fiscal year 2020, from a $10.2 millio n inflow for fiscal year 2019. This increase was
primarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the EC Remedy related to the Bemis acquisition as compared to the U.S. Remedy in the fiscal  year 2019, partially offset by higher capital expenditures
as a result of the Bemis acquisition.
        Capital expenditures were $399.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an in crease of $67.3 million compared to $332.2 million for fiscal year 2019. The inc rease in capital expenditures was primarily
due to the increased capital spending following the Bemis acquisit ion.
        Cash Flow from Financing Activities
        Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by $471.5 m illion, or 61.6%, to $1,236.4 million for fiscal year 2020, from a $764.9 million  outflow for fiscal year 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the $500 million on-market share buy-back program, partially  offset by net inflows from long and short-term debt sources.
Net Debt
        We borrow money from financial institutions and debt investors in the form  of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes and commercia l paper. We have a mixture of fixed
and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further fl exibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings.
        Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 mon ths and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term  nature of the borrowings, except where we
have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt be yond 12 months. The current portion of the long-term debt consists of debt  amounts repayable within a year after the balance
sheet date.
35
        Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to  negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebte dness we can incur to a range between 7.5% to
15.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions a nd variations by facility. In addition, the bank debt facilities and U.S. p rivate placement debt require us to comply with certain financial
covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios. The negativ e pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the re lated debt agreements. As of June 30, 2020, we are in
compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilit ies and U.S. private placement debt.
        Our net debt as of both June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 was $5.5 billion.
Available Financing
        As of June 30, 2020, we had undrawn credit facilities available in t he amount of $1.8 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund w orking capital, growth capital expenditures and
refinancing obligations and are provided to us by five separate bank syndi cates. On September 25, 2019 and December 15, 2019, we canceled $250.0 mil lion and $100.0 million, respectively, of the
$750.0 million term loan facility.
        During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company extended the maturit y of a 364-day syndicated facility by an additional six months to Octo ber 2020 and reduced the facility size from
$1,050.0 million to $840 million. This facility was canceled on June  29, 2020 following the issuance of a $500.0 million 10 year senior unsecu red note on June 19, 2020 and a €500.0 million 7 year
senior unsecured note on June 23, 2020.
        As of June 30, 2020, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of $4.2 billion, of which $2.4 billion had been drawn (inclus ive of amounts drawn under commercial paper
programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilitie s). Our senior facilities mature between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, with an  option to extend.
Dividend Payments
        In fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid $761.1 million, $679.7 million a nd $526.8 million, respectively, in dividends.
Credit Rating
        Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investm ent grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to our
ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various tenors a nd from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European a nd U.S. debt capital markets and from global
financial institutions.
Share Repurchases
        On August 21, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an on-market buy-back of $500 m illion of ordinary shares and Chess Depositary Instruments ("CDIs"). Durin g the twelve months ended
June 30, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately $500.0 million, excl uding transaction costs, or 53.9 million shares. The shares repurchase d as part of the program were canceled upon
repurchase.
        We had cash outflows of $67.0 million, $20.2 million and $35.7 millio n for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2020, 2019  and 2018, respectively, as treasury shares
to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation aw ards and shares purchased for shareholder settlement in the fourth quarter o f fiscal year 2020. As of June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018,
we held treasury shares at cost of $67.0 million, $16.1 million and $10 .7 million, representing 6.7 million, 1.4 million and 0.9 million share s, respectively.

projected bank reference rates.
(3) We lease certain manufacturing sites, office space, warehouses, land, vehicles and equipment under operating leases. The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. Not included in the
above commitments are contingent rental payments which may arise as part of the rental increase indexed to the consumer price index or in the event that units produced by certain leased assets exceed a
predetermined production capacity.
(4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
        Other than as described under "Contractual Obligations" as of Ju ne 30, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet contractual obligations  or other commitments.
Liquidity Risk and Outlook
        In 2020, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. However, our access was temporarily restricted in March both in the U.S. and Euro pe due to
the impact from COVID-19 on financial markets. We refinanced these maturit ies with drawings under our committed bank facilities. As a precautio nary measure to maximize liquidity, in March
2020, we also extended our 364-day syndicated facility by an additional si x months to October 2020 while reducing the facility size from $1,050.0 mi llion to $840.0 million. This facility was
canceled on June 29, 2020 following the issuance of a $500.0 million 1 0-year senior unsecured note on June 19, 2020 and a €500.0 million 7-year seni or unsecured note on June 23, 2020. The
Company also filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement on June 10, 2020, which enabled the Company to issue the two notes in June 2020 an d will enable the Company to issue debt securities in
the future when market conditions are favorable and on a timely basis .
        Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter di fficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities. We manage our liquidity risk
centrally and such management involves maintaining available fund ing and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committe d credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our
business, we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure th rough the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured note s, commercial paper and factoring. The following
guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:
• maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;
• regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing and financing activiti es;
• generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets ;
• maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable i ndependent rating agency;
• managing credit risk related to financial assets;
37
• monitoring the duration of long-term debt;
• only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions;  and
• to the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term d ebt facilities.
        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $1,976.5 mil lion and $221.2 million, respectively, was drawn under our commercial pa per programs. However, such programs
are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities w ith maturities in April 2022 ($750.0 million), April 2023 ($1.5 billion) a nd April 2024 ($1.5 billion), with an option to extend, under
which we had $1.8 billion in unused capacity remaining as of June 30, 20 20.
        We expect long-term future funding needs to primarily relate to refina ncing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturi ng as outlined above and to finance our growth capital
expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed. W e expect to continue to fund our long-term business needs on the same ba sis as in the past, i.e., partially through the cash flow
provided by operating activities available to the business and man agement of the capital of the business, in particular through issuan ce of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis. We
decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions  individually based on, among other factors, the return on investment aft er related financing costs and the payback period of
required upfront cash investments in light of our mid-term liquidity plannin g covering a period of four years post the current financial year. Our lo ng-term access to liquidity depends on both our
results of operations and on the availability of funding in financial m arkets.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments
        Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results  of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, wh ich have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimate s and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liab ilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of ex penses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate ou r estimates and judgments, including those related to
retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, equity method inve stments and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance s. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assump tions or conditions.
        We believe the following are critical accounting estimates u sed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
• the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and li abilities;
• valuation of intangible assets and goodwill;
• calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions;
• calculation of equity method investments; and
• calculation of acquisition fair values.
Considerations Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
        The impact that the recent COVID-19 pandemic will have on our conso lidated operations is uncertain. While the overall impact on o ur operations to date has not been material, we have
experienced volatility in customer order patterns. We have considere d the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in our critical ac counting estimates and judgements as of June 30, 2020 and
will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on our bus iness and consolidated results of operations.
Pension Costs
        Approximately 50% of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entran ts and future accruals. The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portio n of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United Sta tes, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2020 was $9.9 million, com pared to pension cost of $12.5 million in fiscal year 2019 and $7.7 mil lion in fiscal year 2018. We expect pension expense
before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2021 to be approximately $1 2.7 million. 
        For our sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that ma nagement make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate  of return on plan assets, discount rates used to
determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary  inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. We believe that  the accounting estimates related to
38
our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are  highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performan ce of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions
and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is bas ed on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the  time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends
performed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantiall y from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.
        The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the pro jected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the cons olidated balance sheet as an asset, in the case of an
overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. Th e gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded
as a component of other comprehensive income. Pension plan liabi lities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires rem easurement, based on updated assumptions and information
about the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial ga ins and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are  amortized on a straight-line basis from the date
recognized over the average remaining service period of active particip ants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inact ive participants. The service costs related to defined
benefits are included in operating income. The other components of net be nefit cost are presented in the consolidated statement of income s eparately from the service cost component and outside
operating income.
        We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the presen t value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at  each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond
yield curve, derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputabl e third-party indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate
bonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rat e. For Mexico, Poland and Turkey, a corporate bond credit spread has been add ed to the government bond yields. Additionally,
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future long-term return assumptio n for each individual asset class. A single long-term
return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan's tar get asset allocation.
Pension Assumptions Sensitivity Analysis
        The following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal y ear 2021 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate  and the expected long-term rate of return on assets.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill
        Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price o ver the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. Good will is not amortized but is instead tested annually or
when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occ urred. Our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for pot ential impairment. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting
unit, which is defined as an operating segment, at the time of each acquis ition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit. We have si x reporting units, of which five are included in our
Flexibles Segment. The other reporting unit that is also a reporting s egment is Rigid Packaging.
        Goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate  an impairment may have occurred during
the year. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair val ue, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between  the carrying value and estimated fair value of the
reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount o f the carrying value of goodwill.
        In performing our impairment analysis, we may elect to first assess  qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is ne cessary. If we determine that a quantitative test is necessary, or
elect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative tes t, we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using inco me approaches. The most
39
significant assumptions used in the determination of the estima ted fair value of the reporting units are the estimated net sales an d earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, discount
rate and terminal values.
        Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests a re considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consol idated balance sheet and the judgment required in
determining fair value amounts, including undiscounted projected future c ash flows. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be te sted more frequently for impairment than annually.
Factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings, adv erse equity market conditions, and other external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in the need for more frequent
assessments.
        Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relat ionships, technology, trademarks and software and are amortized using the  straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,
which range from one to 20 years. We review these intangible assets for impai rment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest  that the remaining value is not recoverable. The
test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, mo st of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates. These estimates and projections require judgments as to
future events, conditions, and amounts of future cash flows.
Deferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions
        We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application o f complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The determi nation of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of
whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more  likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the  tax return will be sustained on tax audit, including resolution of
related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The recognized tax b enefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely tha n not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. Significant
estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions a nd related income tax expense and benefit. Additionally, we are als o required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax
assets against future sources of taxable income which might result i n the need for a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, including operat ing loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we
do not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all availa ble evidence. Significant judgments and estimates, including e xpected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the
feasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in determining t he need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. If actu al results differ from these estimates or there are future
changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates, we may need to adjust valua tion allowances or tax liabilities, which could have a material im pact on our consolidated financial position and results of
operations.
Equity Accounted Investments
        Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which we believe we  exercise significant influence over operating and financial polici es, are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost an d is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee  after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid. The
assessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is  other-than-temporary and the amount of such other-than-temporary decl ine requires significant estimates.
        We review our investment in affiliated companies for impairmen t whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying  amount may not be recoverable. For example, we tested our
investment in AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") for impairment at March 31, 2020 give n that the quoted share price had experienced a significant decline i n the month of March associated with
general market declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of March, we c oncluded that the decline was temporary, and the investment was not impaired given our intention to hold the
investment. However, the quoted share price did not recover in our fiscal fourth quarter and we determined that the investment was impaired as  of June 30, 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of
$25.6 million. We also recorded impairment charges of our AMVIG investment of $14.0 million in fiscal year 2019 and $36.5 million in fiscal year 2018.
Acquisitions
        We record acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterpri se using the purchase method of accounting. We recognize the identi fiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-
controlling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of th e date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the con sideration transferred, also measured at fair value, over the
net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acq uired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting  requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions,
especially with respect to intangible assets.
40
        We use all available information to estimate fair values a nd typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair v alue determination for significant acquisitions. The fair value
measurements are based on available historical information and on exp ectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspect ive of marketplace participants. Critical estimates in valuing
intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected cas h flows from customer relationships, acquired developed technology, corpo rate trade name and brand names; the period of time we expect
to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.
        In estimating the future cash flows, we consider demand, competition, oth er economic factors and actuarial assumptions for defined benefit pl ans. We utilize common valuation techniques such
as discounted cash flows and market approaches, including the relief-from -royalty method to value acquired developed technology, trade names and brand names. Customer relationships are valued
using the cost approach or an income approach such as the excess earning s method. We believe our estimates to be based on assumptions tha t are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and
unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimate s, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
        In connection with a given business acquisition, we may identify pre-a cquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend o ur review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition
contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain suf ficient information to assess whether we include these contingenci es as part of the fair value estimates acquired and liabilities
assumed and, if so, to determine the estimated amounts.
        In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allo wances assumed in a business combination are initially esti mated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quart erly
based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisit ion date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being rec orded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period.
        We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an a cquired company separately from the business acquisition. A liabil ity for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is
recognized and measured at fair value in the consolidated stateme nt of income in the period in which the liability is incurred. We refl ect acquired operations that we intend to dispose of as
discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income and as  assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet.

Item 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Overview
        Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial ri sks. Our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on Amcor's financial
performance. From time to time, we enter into various derivative financi al instruments such as foreign exchange contracts, commodity fixed pric e swaps (on behalf of customers) and interest rate
swaps to manage these risks. Our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegate d authorities, which provide guidelines for control,
counterparty risk and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments a re designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements i n foreign exchange rates, raw material prices and to fixed
and variable interest rates, but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statem ent volatility. However, we do not trade in
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In addition , we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respe ctive legal entity's functional currency to economically
hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our non U.S. subsidiari es, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may incre ase income statement volatility.
        There have been no material changes in the risks described below , other than increased volatility in connection with the COVID-19 pande mic, for the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 related to
interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, raw material and commodity pric e risk and credit risk.
Interest Rate Risk
        Our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintain ing a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global inte rest rates and, where appropriate, hedging floating
interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of int erest rate swaps.
        A hypothetical but reasonably possible increase of 1% in the floatin g rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both , derivative and non-derivative instruments denominated in
U.S. dollars, the currency with the largest interest rate sensitivity, o utstanding as of June 30, 2020, would have resulted in an adverse impact on i ncome before income taxes and equity in income
(loss) of affiliated companies of $17.1 million for the year ended June 30,  2020.
Foreign Exchange Risk
        We operate in over 40 countries across the world.
        For the year ended June 30, 2020, a hypothetical but reasonably possi ble adverse change of 1% in the underlying average foreign currency excha nge rate for the Euro would have resulted in an
adverse impact on our net sales of $22.3 million.
        During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, 49% and 36% of our net sales, respectiv ely, were effectively generated in U.S. dollar functional currency entiti es. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, 18% and
24% of net sales, respectively, were generated in Euro functional curre ncy entities with the remaining 33% and 40% of net sales, respecti vely, being generated in entities with functional currencies
other than U.S. dollars and Euros. The impact of translating Euro and other n on-U.S. dollar net sales and operating expenses into U.S. dollar for reportin g purposes will vary depending on the
movement of those currencies from period to period.
Raw Material and Commodity Price Risk
        The primary raw materials for our products are resins, film, aluminum, and liquids. We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing o f our products and are exposed to commodity
price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price risk.
        Changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities, incl uding resins, film, aluminum, inks, solvents, adhesives and liquids  and other raw materials, may result in a temporary or
permanent reduction in income before income taxes and equity in income  (loss) of affiliated companies depending on the level of recovery by mate rial type. The level of recovery depends both on the
type of material and the market in which we operate. Across our busines s, we have a number of contractual provisions that allow for passing on o f raw material price fluctuations to customers within
predefined periods.
        A hypothetical but reasonably possible 1% increase on average pric es for resins, film, aluminum and liquids, not passed on to the custome r by way of a price adjustment, would have resulted in
an increase in cost of sales and hence an
42
adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income  (loss) of affiliated companies for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 of $56.9 milli on and $41.4 million, respectively.
Credit Risk
        Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its con tractual obligations, resulting in financial loss. We are exposed to cre dit risk arising from financing activities including
deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments, as well as from over-th e-counter raw material and commodity related derivative
instruments.
        We manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions throu gh our counterparty risk policy, which provide guidelines on setting limit s to minimize the concentration of risks and
therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty fai lure and on dealing and settlement procedures. The investment of surpl us funds is made only with approved counterparties and
within credit limits assigned to each specific counterparty. Fin ancial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit  quality approved financial institutions. As of June 30, 2020 and
2019, we did not have a significant concentration of credit risk in rel ation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our hedging  and risk management activities.

Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amcor plc
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control ove r Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amc or plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the two years i n the period ended June 30, 2020, including the related notes and schedu le of valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves
for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 listed in the index appe aring under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated fin ancial statements”). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, ba sed on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above pres ent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the C ompany as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period end ed June 30, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally acce pted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based o n criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework  (2013) issued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal con trol over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the desi gn and operating effectiveness of internal
controls over the period end reporting process. Specifically, management  did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflict ing duties were appropriately segregated within key IT
systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficienci es, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a  reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annu al
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described  in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered this material weakn ess in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests appli ed in our audit of the June 30, 2020 consolidated financial
statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Com pany’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion  on those consolidated financial statements.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements , the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2020.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated finan cial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over fin ancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in management's repo rt referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Compa ny’s consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit s. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Compa ny Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordanc e with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and  regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. T hose standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain re asonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether d ue to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reportin g was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consol idated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures incl uded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and di sclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluat ing the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. Our audit of internal
44
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of inte rnal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a materia l weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the as sessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we  considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor ting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process des igned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financ ial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accountin g principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting incl udes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairl y reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the co mpany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in a ccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of th e company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effe ct on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial re porting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any  evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proc edures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arisi ng from the current period audit of the consolidated financial stateme nts that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that  are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii ) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any wa y our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole , and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit m atter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Flexibles North America and Flexi bles Latin America Reporting Units within the Flexibles Segm ent
As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statem ents, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $5,339.3 mil lion at June 30, 2020, and the goodwill associated with the
Flexibles Segment was $4,369.1 million, which includes goodwill as sociated with the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin Americ a reporting units. Management conducts an impairment
analysis in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events and circums tances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Mana gement performed a quantitative assessment for
goodwill impairment, utilizing present value (discounted cash flow) me thods to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the carrying value  of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
management would recognize an impairment loss equal to the differen ce between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount
of the carrying value of goodwill. Management’s projected future cash flows for t he Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting u nits included significant judgments and
assumptions relating to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures  relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Flexibles Nort h America and Flexibles Latin America reporting
units within the Flexibles Segment is a critical audit matter a re that there was significant judgment by management when develo ping the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led
to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing  procedures to evaluate management’s projected future cash flows and significant assumptions, including revenue growth,
projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rate s. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with sp ecialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these
procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audi t evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financi al statements. These procedures included testing the
effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impa irment analysis, including controls over the valuation of the Flexib les North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units.
These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s  process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropria teness of the discounted cash flow models; testing the
completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the mo dels; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by manag ement, including
45
revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and dis count rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenu e growth, projected operating income growth, and
terminal values involved evaluating whether the assumptions use d by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performanc e of the reporting units, (ii) the consistency with
external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were c onsistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Profe ssionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used
to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow mode ls and certain significant assumptions, including the terminal values and discount rates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Note 1 - Business Description
        Amcor plc ("Amcor" or the "Company") is a holding company originally in corporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company in corporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick
of Jersey in July 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination wit h Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and became a public limited
company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. On June 1 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc (" Bemis"). The combination of Amcor and Bemis
has created a global packaging leader. See Note 4, "Acquisitions and Divest itures," for more information on the Bemis acquisition.
        The Company develops and produces a broad range of packaging products i ncluding flexible packaging, rigid packaging containers, specialty c artons, and closures. The Company employs
approximately 47,000 individuals and has 231 principal manufacturing facilities in more than 40 countries.

Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompa ny
transactions and balances have been eliminated. The consolidate d financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting princ iples generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP").
Business Combinations: The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which requi res separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from goodwill, at the acquisition
date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as t he excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-control ling interests in the acquiree over the net of the
acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities  assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the a cquisition date, the Company has the ability to
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assu med with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the m easurement period or final determination of the values of
assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any  subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement  of income.
Discontinued Operations Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect  the three plants in Europe acquired as part of the Bemis acquisiti on as a discontinued
operation in fiscal 2019 as the Company agreed to divest of these plant s as a condition of approval from the European Commission. See Note 5, "Di scontinued Operations," for more information on
discontinued operations. The plants were divested in the first quarter of fisc al 2020.
Estimates and Assumptions Required:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requ ires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidat ed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expens es during the reporting periods.
        These estimates are based on historical experience and various ass umptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Managem ent evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and
adjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change. As future ev ents and their impacts cannot be determined with precision, actual resu lts may differ from these estimates. In the opinion of
management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adju stments necessary to fairly present the results of the periods presente d.
        The impact that the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic will h ave on the Company's consolidated operations is uncertain. The Com pany has considered the potential impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic when developing the Company's estimates and judge ments as of June 30, 2020, and will continue to evaluate the extent of th e impact on the Company's business and
consolidated financial statements. The Company's accounting estimat es and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 and the ch ange could be material in future periods.
Translation of Foreign Currencies: The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currenc y of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally the local currency of such entity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the ent ity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the  transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies
other than the entity’s functional currency are remeasured at the exchange  rate as of the balance sheet date to the entity’s functional currency . Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to
short-term and long-term debt are recorded in other non-operating income (loss), n et, in the consolidated statement of income. The Company recorded suc h foreign currency transaction net loss of
$0.4 million, net gain of $1.1 million and net loss of $82.7 million duri ng the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All  other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of incom e. These foreign currency transaction net gains amounted to $21.4 milli on, $8.9 million and $1.0 million during the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
        Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the reporting currency of the Company are tran slated using average exchange rates in effect
during each year. Assets and liabilities of operations with a functi onal currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rat e as of the balance sheet date, while equity balances are
translated at historical rates. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a comp onent of shareholders’ equity.
Highly Inflationary Accounting:  A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumula tive inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a three-year pe riod. If a
country's economy is classified as highly inflationary, the finan cial statements of the foreign entity operating in that country mu st be remeasured to the functional currency of the parent. As of July 1,
2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for ac counting purposes. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine pe so as the functional currency for the Company's
subsidiaries in Argentina. The impact of
54
highly inflationary accounting was $27.7 million and $30.2 million for t he fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the cons olidated statement of income.
Revenue Recognition:  The Company generates revenue by providing its customers with flexible  and rigid packaging serving a variety of markets including food, consum er products and healthcare
end markets. The Company enters into a variety of agreements with custome rs, including quality agreements, pricing agreements and master supply ag reements which outline the terms under which
the Company does business with a specific customer. The Company also sells to some customers solely based on purchase orders. The Compan y has concluded for the vast majority of its revenues,
that its contracts with customers are either a purchase order or the combi nation of a purchase order with a master supply agreement. All revenue rec ognized in the consolidated statement of income is
considered to be revenue from contracts with customers.
        The Company typically satisfies the obligation to provide pa ckaging to customers at a point in time upon shipment when control is tra nsferred to customers. Revenue is recognized net of
allowances for returns and customer claims and any taxes collecte d from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authori ties. The Company does not have any material contract
assets or contract liabilities. The Company disaggregates reven ue based on geography. Disaggregation of revenue is presented in Note 20, "Segme nts".
Significant Judgments
        Determining whether products and services are considered distinct pe rformance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus  together may require significant judgment. The
Company identified potential performance obligations in its custom er master supply agreements and determined that none of them are capable  of being distinct as the customer can only benefit from
the supplied packaging. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it h as one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.
        The Company may provide variable consideration in several forms which are determined through its agreements with customers. The Company ca n offer prompt payment discounts, sales rebates
or other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other ince ntive payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performan ce metrics, including volume. The Company
accounts for variable consideration using the most likely amount me thod. The Company utilizes forecasted sales data and rebate percent ages specific to each customer agreement and updates its
judgment of the amounts to which the customer is entitled each  period.
        The Company enters into long term agreements with certain customers , under which it is obligated to make various up-front payments for which it ex pects to receive a benefit in excess of the
cost over the term of the contract. These up-front payments are deferred and refl ected in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current as sets on its consolidated balance sheet.
Contract incentives are typically recognized as a reduction to revenue  over the term of the customer agreement.
Practical Expedients
        The Company sells primarily through its direct sales force. Any externa l sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amorti zation period would be one year or less. External sales
commission expense is included in selling, general and administrati ve expense in the consolidated statement of income.
        The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fu lfillment costs. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are clas sified as a component of cost of products sold while amounts
billed to customers are classified as a component of net sales.
        The Company excluded from the measurement of the transaction pri ce all taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed  on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing
transaction and collected from the customer, including sales tax es, value added taxes, excise taxes and use taxes. Accordingly, the t ax amounts are not included in net sales.
        The Company does not adjust the promised consideration for the tim e value of money for contracts where the difference between the time of pay ment and performance is one year or less.
Research and Development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.
Restructuring Costs: Restructuring costs are recognized when the liability is incurred. The  Company calculates severance obligations based on its standa rd customary practices. Accordingly, the
Company records provisions for severance when probable and estimable and the Company has committed to the restructuring plan. In the absence of a  standard customary
55
practice or established local practice, liabilities for severance are re cognized when incurred. If fixed assets are to be disposed of as a result of the Company’s restructuring efforts, the assets are written
off when the Company commits to dispose of them and they are no longer in u se. Depreciation is accelerated on fixed assets for the period of time th e asset continues to be used until the asset ceases
to be used. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate equ ipment, are generally recorded as the cost is incurred or the service is p rovided. See Note 6, "Restructuring Plans," for more
information on the Company’s restructuring plans.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid temporary investments wi th a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalent s. Cash equivalents
include certificates of deposit that can be readily liquidated withou t penalty at the Company’s option. Cash equivalents are carried at c ost which approximates fair market value.
Trade Receivables, Net: Trade accounts receivable, net, are stated at the amount the Com pany expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for sales ret urns and the estimated losses resulting from
the inability of its customers to make required payments. When dete rmining the collectability of specific customer accounts, a number of fac tors are evaluated, including: customer creditworthiness,
past transaction history with the customer and changes in customer paym ent terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experi ence, current economic industry trends and a review of
the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when dete rmining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company has an  allowance for doubtful accounts of $35.3 million
and $34.4 million recorded at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in trade re ceivables, net, on the consolidated balance sheet. The current yea r expense to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts
is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the  consolidated statement of income.
        The Company enters into factoring arrangements from time to time t o sell trade receivables to third-party financial institutions. Sales of receivables are accounted for in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Co dification ("ASC") Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing ("ASC 860"). Agreem ents which result in true sales of the
transferred receivables, as defined in ASC 860, which occur when receivables a re transferred without recourse to the Company, are reflected as a reduction of trade receivables, net on the
consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the ca sh flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of c ash flows. Agreements that allow the Company to maintain
effective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qua lify as a true sale, as defined in ASC 860, are accounted for as secu red borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance
sheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expens es associated with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolida ted statement of income primarily as a reduction of net sales.
Factored receivables not qualifying as a true sale were accounted for as  secured borrowings. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, amounts factored recorded under trade receivables, net and short-term
debt, were zero and $152.7 million, respectively.
Inventories:  Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. Inventory values u sing the FIFO method of
accounting approximate replacement cost.
        Inventories are summarized at June 30, 2020 and 2019 as follows:
(in millions) 2020 2019
Raw materials and supplies $ 808.6 $ 864.6 
Work in process and finished goods 1,127.6 1,180.9 
Less: inventory reserves (104.3) (91.7)
Inventory, net $ 1,831.9  $ 1,953.8  
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net:  Property, plant and equipment ("PP&E"), net is carried at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment and includes expenditure s for new facilities and
equipment and those costs which substantially increase the useful li ves or capacity of existing PP&E. Cost of constructed assets includes c apitalized interest incurred during the construction period.
Maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economi c life are expensed as incurred.
        PP&E, including assets held under finance leases, is depreciat ed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives o f assets or, in the case of leasehold improvements and leased
assets, over the period of the lease or useful life of the asset, whicheve r is shorter, as described below. The Company periodically reviews thes e estimated useful lives and, when appropriate, changes
are made prospectively.
56
Leasehold land Over lease term
Land improvements Up to 30 years
Buildings Up to 45 years
Plant and equipment Up to 25 years
Finance leases Shorter of lease term or 5 - 25 years
        For tax purposes, the Company generally uses accelerated methods  of depreciation. The tax effect of the difference between book and tax depreciation has been provided for as deferred income
taxes.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets:  The Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily PP&E and certain ide ntifiable intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment when facts or circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recove rable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future  undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value
of the assets, the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair val ue. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted ca sh flows or external appraisals, as applicable.
        Impairment losses recognized in the consolidated statement of inco me were as follows:
Years ended June 30,
(in millions) 2020 2019 2018
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses $ 0.7 $ 47.7 $ 0. 4 
Restructuring and related expenses 20.8 27.4 4.0 
Total impairment losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income $ 21.5  $ 75.1  $ 4.4  
Leasing:  The Company has operating leases for certain manufacturing sites, offi ce space, warehouses, land, vehicles and equipment. Right-of-use lease  assets and lease liabilities are recognized at
the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term, which includes renewal periods t he Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company
reevaluates its leases on a regular basis to consider the economic a nd strategic incentives of exercising lease renewal options. Sh ort term leases with a term of twelve months or less, including
reasonably certain holding periods, are not recorded on the consolidate d balance sheet. As the Company's leases generally do not provide a n implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing
rate as of the commencement date to determine the present value of le ase payments. The Company recognizes expense for operating leases  on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the
consolidated statement of income. Certain leasing arrangements requ ire variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary fo r other reasons. Variable lease payments that do not
depend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measu rement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability and recognized a s expense in the period in which the obligation for the
payments occur.
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets  acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but in stead tested annually or whenever events and
circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year . Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are a reporti ng unit’s operating results significantly declining
relative to its operating plan or historical performance, and competi tive pressures and changes in the general markets in which it operate s. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global
impacts, the Company considered the potential for goodwill impairm ent of its reporting units in the third fiscal quarter of 2020. The review did not  indicate an impairment triggering event as of
March 31, 2020.
        All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as the  operating segment. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the  Company reassessed its segment reporting structure in
the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexi bles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles  Latin America. With this change, the Company has
six reporting units with goodwill that are assessed for potential impairm ent.
        In performing the required impairment tests, the Company has the option  to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill
impairment. If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more-li kely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carry ing value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The
Company's quantitative assessment utilizes present value (dis counted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting uni ts with goodwill. Determining fair value using discounted cash
flows requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in un derlying assumptions and market factors. Key assumptions relate t o revenue growth, projected
57
operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. If current expe ctations of future growth rates and margins are not met, or if market factors out side of Amcor’s control, such as factors
impacting the applicable discount rate, or economic or political  conditions in key markets, change significantly, then goodwill all ocated to one or more reporting units may be impaired.
        The Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourt h quarter of each year.
        A quantitative impairment analysis was performed in the fourth fisca l quarter for all reporting units for the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2018, whil e a qualitative analysis was performed for the
fiscal year ended 2019. The Company’s annual impairment analysis fo r all three fiscal years concluded that goodwill was not impaired. T he Company’s quantitative goodwill analysis in fiscal years
2020 and 2018 concluded that the fair values substantially exceeded t he carrying amounts for each reporting unit.
        Although no reporting units failed the assessments noted above in th e annual impairment analysis for 2020, during the time subsequent to t he annual evaluation, and at June 30, 2020, the
Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstan ces, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, had resulted in the lik elihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting
units may have been impaired. It is management's opinion that no s uch events have occurred.
Other Intangible Assets, Net:  Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite us eful lives are amortized against income using the straight-line meth od over their estimated useful lives,
with original periods ranging from one to 20 years. The straight-line meth od of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the  intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the
amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for impairme nt when facts and circumstances indicate carrying value
may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the ass ets are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows  or appraised values.
        Costs incurred to develop software programs to be used solely to meet th e Company's internal needs have been capitalized as computer softwa re within other intangible assets.
Fair Value Measurements:  The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial lia bilities reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the asse ts or paid to transfer the liabilities in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement dat e (exit price). The Company determines fair value based on a three-tie red fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of:
• Level 1: fair value measurements represent exchange-traded securitie s which are valued at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for ide ntical assets or liabilities that the
Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date;
• Level 2: fair value measurements are determined using input prices th at are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly obs ervable through corroboration with
observable market data; and
• Level 3: fair value measurements are determined using unobservable i nputs, such as internally developed pricing models for the asset or l iability due to little or no market activity
for the asset or liability.
Financial Instruments:  The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the consolidated  balance sheet at fair value. The impact on earnings from recognizing th e fair values of these
instruments depends on their intended use, their hedge designation and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging. Derivatives not designated as
hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through income. Dependi ng on the nature of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, c hanges in the fair value are either offset against the change
in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments t hrough earnings or recognized in shareholders’ equity through other comprehe nsive income until the hedged item is recognized.
Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any hedge  are recognized through earnings over the life of the hedging relationsh ip.
        See Note 11, "Derivative Instruments," for more information regarding speci fic derivative instruments included on the Company’s consolidated bal ance sheet, such as forward foreign currency
exchange contracts, currency swap contracts, and interest rate swap arran gements, among other derivative instruments.
Employee Benefit Plans:  The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans to which it make s contributions on behalf of employees. The expense under such pla ns was $63.5 million, $39.9
million and $39.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 an d 2018, respectively.
58
        The Company sponsors a number of defined benefit plans that provide  benefits to current and former employees. For the company-sponsored plans,  the relevant accounting guidance requires
that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term  rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the pre sent value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation
rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. The Company believes th at the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are cri tical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptib le to
change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actu arial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. Th e selection of assumptions is based on historical
trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuat ion, as well as independent studies of trends performed by the Company ’s actuaries. However, actual results may differ
substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.
        The Company recognizes the funded status of each defined benefit  pension plan in the consolidated balance sheet. Each overfunded  plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is
recognized as a liability. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annua lly, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on update d assumptions and information about the individuals
covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a strai ght-line basis from the date recognized over the
average remaining service period of active participants or over the avera ge life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. T he service costs related to defined benefits are included in
operating income. The other components of net benefit cost other than  service cost are recorded within other non-operating income (loss), net in the consolidated statement of income
Equity Method Investments: Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which the Company belie ves it exercises significant influence over operating and financial p olicies, are accounted for
using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment  is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor’s sha re of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of
acquisition and is adjusted for impairment whenever it is determine d that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other tha n temporary. The fair value of the investment then becomes the
new cost basis of the investment and it is not adjusted for subsequen t recoveries in fair value. Impairment losses have been recognized for t he Company's equity investment in AMVIG Holdings
Limited ("AMVIG") in the last three fiscal years. See Note 7, "Equity Me thod Investments," for more information regarding the Company's equity me thod investments.
Share-based Compensation:  Amcor has a variety of equity incentive plans. For employee awards with a serv ice or market condition, compensation expense is recognized over the ves ting period on
a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the es timated number of awards that are expected to vest. For awards with a perform ance condition, the Company must reassess
the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compen sation cost based on its probability assessment. The Company als o has cash-settled share-based compensation plans which are
accounted for as liabilities. Such share-based awards are remeasured t o fair value at each reporting period. The Company estimates forfeitures b ased on employee level, economic conditions, time
remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience.
Income Taxes:  The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for incom e taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences o f differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balanc e sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. In come tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported
in the consolidated financial statements. The provision for incom e tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently  payable because certain items of income and expense
included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in d ifferent time periods by taxing authorities.
        Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and ta x credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opin ion of management, it is more likely than not that
any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, fro m time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclo se uncertain tax positions for proposed adjustments from
various tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course  of business. In making these assessments, management must oft en analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions.
Accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement  attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement  of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, i f any, as tax expense in the tax provision. See Note 16, "Income Taxes,"  for more information on the Company's income
taxes.

Note 3 - New Accounting Guidance
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
        In March 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10762, " Financial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guarante ed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize  a
Registrant's Securities " that simplifies the disclosure requirements related to registere d securities under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The rule replaces the require ment to provide condensed
consolidating financial information with a requirement to present sum marized financial information of the issuers and guarantors in eithe r a note to the financial statements or in management's
discussion and analysis. The effective date of the amendment is Ja nuary 4, 2021 with earlier voluntary compliance permitted. The Company  elected to adopt the amended rules effective with our third
fiscal quarter of 2020 and has included the required disclosures as a comp onent of "Part II, Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
        In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued g uidance that requires the Company to disclose a description of the  Company’s accounting policy for releasing
income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income an d whether the Company elects to reclassify the stranded income tax ef fects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("The Act"), along
with information about other income tax effects that are reclassified. For all entities, the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning  after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Entities can choose whether to apply the amendments retro spectively to each period in which the effect of the Act is recogniz ed or to apply the amendments in the period of adoption.
This guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2019. The Company adopted the new guidance effective July 1, 2019 and did not elect th e optional reclassification as the impact was not
material.
        In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies existing g uidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the  economic effects of risk management activities in the
financial statements. For public business entities, the amendm ents in Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12 were effective for financ ial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Thi s guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2019 using the modi fied retrospective approach, with the exception of
presentation and disclosure guidance which is adopted prospective ly. Implementation of the standard did not have a material impact on  the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.
        In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that required lessees to put mos t leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their in come statements in a manner similar to past
accounting guidance. The guidance also eliminates the previo us real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sa le-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease execu tory costs
for all entities. Lease classification will determine how to recog nize lease-related revenue and expense. The Company adopted the new l ease standard at July 1, 2019 using a simplified transition
option that allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period  of adoption and therefore did not restate prior periods. The Company also  elected to adopt the package of practical expedients
which allows for existing operating leases to continue to be class ified as operating leases under the new guidance without reassessing whether the contracts contain a lease under the new guidance or
whether classification of the operating lease would be different under the  new standard. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight practi cal expedient but did adopt the practical expedient
pertaining to land easements which provides the option not to reas sess whether land easements not previously accounted for as leases unde r prior leasing guidance would be leases under the new
guidance.
        Adoption of the new leasing standard resulted in the following impa cts to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements as  of the adoption date: the establishment of a lease liability
of $590.5 million, including current portion, a corresponding right-of-use as set of $569.8 million, and the reclassification of approximately $58.2 m illion (net of tax) of deferred gains on sale
leaseback transactions.
        The complete impact of the changes made to the Company's conde nsed consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of the new l easing guidance were as follows:
60
($ in millions) June 30, 2019 Adjustments due to Adoption At July 1, 2019
Operating lease assets — 569.8 569.8 
Other current liabilities 1,044.9 54.3 1,099.2 
Operating lease liabilities — 506.8 506.8 
Deferred tax liabilities 1,011.7 18.7 1,030.4 
Other non-current liabilities 241.0 (68.2) 172.8 
Retained earnings 323.7 58.2 381.9 
        Due to the adoption of the guidance using the simplified transitio n option, there are no changes to the Company's previously reported resu lts prior to July 1, 2019. Lease expense is not expected
to change materially as a result of adoption of the new guidance. The C ompany changed its disclosures related to leasing beginning i n fiscal year 2020. Refer to Note 14, "Leases".
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
        In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires financial assets , or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to b e presented at the net amount expected to be collected
when finalized. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation accou nt that will be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financ ial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected
to be collected on the financial asset. This guidance affects lo ans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in lease s, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables and any ot her
financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contract ual right to receive cash. For public business entities, the amendm ents in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The  guidance will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2020 and will be  adopted using the modified retrospective
approach. The Company does not expect the standard to have a materi al impact on its consolidated financial statements.
        In December 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify the ac counting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and improving th e consistent application of U.S. GAAP in
other tax accounting areas. This guidance is effective for annual rep orting periods, and any interim periods within those annual perio ds, that begin after December 15, 2020 with early adoption
permitted. Accordingly, the guidance will be effective for the Compan y on July 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact th at this guidance will have on its financial statements and
related disclosures.
        In March 2020, the FASB issued optional expedients and exceptions t o ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform rela ted to contract modifications, hedging relationships,
and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBO R") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, subject to  meeting certain criteria. The Company is
currently evaluating whether to elect the adoption of this optional  guidance.
        The Company considers the applicability and impact of a ll ASUs issued by the FASB and SEC. The Company determined that all other ASUs not yet adopted to be either not applicable or are
expected to have minimal impact on the Company's consolidated fin ancial statements at this time.

Note 4 - Acquisitions and Divestitures
Year ended June 30, 2019
Bemis Company, Inc.
        On June 11, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc ("Bemis"), a global manufactu rer of flexible packaging products based in
the United States. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, dated as of Au gust 6, 2018, each outstanding share of Bemis common stock that was i ssued and outstanding upon completion of the
transaction was converted into the right to receive 5.1 ordinary shares of th e Company traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").
        The following table summarizes the fair value of consideration ex changed:
Bemis shares outstanding at June 11, 2019 (in millions) 91.7 
Share Exchange Ratio 5.1 
Price per Share (Based on Amcor’s closing share price on June 11, 2019) $ 11.18 
Total Equity Consideration $ 5,229.6 
        The acquisition of Bemis positioned the Company as a global lead er in consumer packaging with a comprehensive global footprint in flexib le packaging and greater scale in key regions of North
America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, along with industry-le ading research and development capabilities.
        The acquisition of Bemis was accounted for as a business combin ation in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," which required allocation of the purchase price to the estimated
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the tra nsaction. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assum ed as of the acquisition date were finalized upon completion of th e
measurement period in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. The allocation was subject to change within the measurement period, up to one year from  the acquisition date, as additional information
concerning final asset and liability valuations was obtained. The  measurement period adjustments resulted in a $229.9 million increas e to goodwill, which includes a $210.6 million decrease to
property, plant and equipment, a $99.0 million decrease to finite l ived intangible assets, a $184.1 million decrease to deferred tax liabi lities, a $97.9 million increase in other non-current liabilities,
along with other adjustments to assets held for sale and working capi tal.

Total liabilities assumed 2,983.9  
Net identifiable assets acquired 1,862.0  
Goodwill 3,367.6 
Net assets acquired $ 5,229.6  
        The following table details the identifiable intangible assets  acquired from Bemis, their fair values and estimated useful lives:

Customer relationships $ 1,650.0 15
Technology 110.0 7
Other 171.2 7
Total other intangible assets $ 1,931.2  
 
        The allocation of the purchase price resulted in $3,367.6 million of g oodwill for the Flexibles Segment, which is not tax deductible.  The goodwill on acquisition represents the future economic
benefit expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do  not qualify for separate recognition, including assembled workforce an d non-contractual relationships, as well as expected future
synergies.
        The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets a nd liabilities was based on significant inputs not observable in t he market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair
value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were det ermined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash  flows, appraisals and market comparables.
63
Divestitures
        Closing of the Bemis acquisition was conditional upon the receipt  of regulatory approvals, approval by both Amcor and Bemis shareholders, and s atisfaction of other customary conditions. In
order to satisfy certain regulatory approvals, the Company was required t o divest three of Bemis' medical packaging facilities locate d in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy") and three
Amcor medical packaging facilities in the United States ("U.S. Reme dy"). The U.S. Remedy was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 a nd the Company received $214.2 million
resulting in a gain of $159.1 million. The EC Remedy was completed d uring the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the Company received $397.1 million  and recorded a loss on the sale of $8.8 million
which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated foreign currenc y translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to e arnings from discontinued operations upon sale of
the EC Remedy.
        In addition, the Company sold an equity method investment acqui red through the Bemis acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 for proc eeds of $27.7 million. There was no gain on sale as
the investment was recorded at fair value upon acquisition. 
Unaudited Pro Forma Information
        The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared as if the a cquisition of Bemis and the sale of the EC Remedy and U.S. Remedy ha d occurred as of July 1, 2017. The unaudited

Note 5 - Discontinued Operations
        On February 11, 2019, the Company received approval from the European Commis sion ("EC") for the acquisition of Bemis. A condition of the approval was an agreement to divest three Bemis
medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Irel and ("EC Remedy"). Upon completion of the Bemis acquisition on June 1 1, 2019, the Company determined that the EC Remedy
met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, in acc ordance with ASC 205-20, "Discontinued Operations." The sale of the EC Re medy closed on August 8, 2019. The Company
recorded a loss on the sale of $8.8 million, which is the result of the rec lassification of accumulated foreign currency translation amounts from a ccumulated other comprehensive income to earnings
from discontinued operations upon sale of the EC Remedy.
        The assets and liabilities of the EC Remedy, which is within the Company's Flexibles Segment, are reflected as held for sale in the consol idated balance sheet at June 30, 2019. Assets and
liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded a t the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
        The following table summarizes the results of the EC Remedy, clas sified as discontinued operations, from June 11, 2019 until the sale  of the EC Remedy on August 8, 2019:

Note 6 - Restructuring Plans
2019 Bemis Integration Plan
        In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company initiat ed restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integ rating and optimizing the combined organization. As
previously announced, the Company continues to target realizing app roximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, suppl y chain, and general and administrative savings by the
end of fiscal year 2022.
        The Company's total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integra tion costs are expected to be approximately $200 million. The tota l 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of
restructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integra tion expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised  of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses,
$25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other re structuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. The C ompany estimates that approximately $150 million of the $200
million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, o f which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Ca sh payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of
which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and relat ed expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexible s segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed
by the end of fiscal year 2022.
        Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restruc turing activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration cos ts
are not linked to restructuring. The Company believes the disclosure  of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost  of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring
related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and inclu de costs to replace graphics and train new employees on relocated equi pment.
2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan
        On August 21, 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Ri gid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at re ducing structural costs and optimizing the
footprint. The Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities  and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimizat ion and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost
reductions.
        The Company's total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan  pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 mil lion with the main component being the cost to exit
manufacturing facilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth q uarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash
impairments. The Company estimates that approximately $65 to $70 mill ion of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures . Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million.
The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan is expected to be comple ted during fiscal year 2021.
2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan
        On June 9, 2016, the Company announced a major initiative ("2016 Flexib les Restructuring Plan") to optimize the cost base and drive earnin gs growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative
was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization  within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the
cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexit y, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to m arket.
        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, the Company has cl osed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certai n facilities. The Company's total pre-tax restructuring
costs were $230.8 million, with $166.7 million in employee termina tion costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to
dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. Approxim ately $166 million of the $230.8 million total costs resulted in  cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4
million. The Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal  year 2019.
Other Restructuring Plans
        The Company entered into other individually immaterial restruct uring plans ("Other Restructuring Plans"). The Company's restructuring cha rge related to these Plans was approximately $17.9
million, $18.8 million and $25.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2020 , 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Note 7 - Equity Method Investments
        Investments accounted for under the equity method generally include  all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significa nt influence, with usually not more than 50% voting
interest, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in i nvestments in affiliated companies. Investments in affiliated c ompanies as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 include an interest in AMVIG
Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") of 47.6% and other individually immaterial in vestments.
        AMVIG is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its quoted share price as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $0.18 (HKD 1.40) and $0.24 (HKD 1.85), respectiv ely. The value of Amcor's
investment in AMVIG based on its quoted share price as of June 30, 2020 and 2019  was $77.7 million and $104.8 million, respectively.
        During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company receiv ed dividends of $9.8 million, $8.2 million and $8.4 million, respectivel y, from AMVIG.
        The Company reviews its investment in affiliated companies  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicat e the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Due to
impairment indicators present in each of the years presented, the Com pany performed an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of its  investment in AMVIG to its fair value, which was
determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price. The fair value of the invest ment dropped below its carrying value during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and  2018, and therefore the Company recorded an
other-than-temporary impairment of $25.6 million, $14.0 million and $3 6.5 million, respectively, to bring the value of its investment to fair value. The impairment charge was included in equity in
income (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax, in the consolidated st atement of income.

Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements
        The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be rec eived to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an ord erly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exi t price).
        The Company's non-derivative financial instruments primarily includ e cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, sho rt-term debt and long-term debt. At June 30, 2020 and
2019, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-t erm debt, approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the se instruments.
        Fair value disclosures are classified based on the fair value hierarc hy. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," for information abo ut the Company's fair value hierarchy.
        The fair value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approxi mates its carrying value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt w ith fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if
available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current int erest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles.
        The carrying values and estimated fair values of long-term debt wit h fixed interest rates (excluding finance leases) were as follows:

Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a R ecurring Basis
        Additionally, the Company measures and records certain assets a nd liabilities, including derivative instruments and contingent p urchase consideration liabilities, at fair value.
        The following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments , which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the  fair value hierarchy:

        The fair value of the commodity contracts was determined using a dis counted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and o bserved market forward prices discounted at a currency-
specific rate. Forward exchange contract fair values were determined bas ed on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active ma rkets using inputs such as currency rates and forward points.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined using a discount ed cash flow method based on market-based swap yield curves, considerin g current interest rates.
        The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilit ies was determined for each arrangement individually. The fair value w as determined using the income approach with significant
inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions inclu de the discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achieve ment and probability adjusted financial projections. The expecte d
outcomes are recorded at net present value, which requires adjustmen t over the life for changes in risks and probabilities.
        The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the value of th e Company's Level 3 financial liabilities:

        The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is  included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities i n the consolidated balance sheet. The change in fair value of
the contingent purchase consideration liabilities, which was incl uded in other income, net is due to the passage of time and changes in t he probability of achievement used to develop the estimate.
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a N onrecurring Basis
        In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair val ue on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by U.S. GAAP.
The Company measures certain assets, including the Company’s equit y method investments, technology intangible assets, other intangib le assets and goodwill at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. The fair val ues of these assets are determined, when applicable, based on val uation techniques using the best information available, and
may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted  cash flow projections.
        The Company tests for impairment of its equity method investments  when impairment indicators are present. Impairment tests were performed by comparing the carrying value of the
Company’s investment in AMVIG at the end of each
73
period, including interim periods, to the fair value of the investmen t, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price which is cl assified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
        Based on the Company’s evaluation of AMVIG’s current financial con dition and the Company’s intent and ability to hold its investm ent in AMVIG to recover the carrying value, the Company
concluded that the decline in fair value was temporary at March 31, 2020, a nd therefore no impairment was recorded. However, the quoted share price did  not recover in the fiscal fourth quarter and
the Company determined that the investment was impaired as of Jun e 30, 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of $25.6 million. The Comp any also recorded impairment charges of our AMVIG
investment of $14.0 million in fiscal year 2019 and $36.5 million in fis cal year 2018.
        The Company tests indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment  when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. The
Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $31.1 million in the fiscal year 2019 to reduce the carrying value of an indefinite-lived t echnology intangible asset to its fair value. During fiscal
year 2020 and 2018, there were no indefinite-lived intangible impairment  charges recorded.

Note 11 - Derivative Instruments
        The Company periodically uses derivatives and other financial inst ruments to hedge exposures to interest rates, commodity and currency risk s. The Company does not hold or issue financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, the Company, at inception, formally desig nates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge
or a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, th e Company assesses and documents that its hedges have been and are ex pected to continue to be highly effective.
Interest Rate Risk
        The Company's policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitori ng global interest rates and, where appropriate, hedging
floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through various  interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, i nterest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and
interest rate locks.
        For interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value hedges, cha nges in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying  debt obligations are immediately recognized in
interest expense. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps tha t have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the a ccompanying consolidated statement of income under other
non-operating income (loss), net.
        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of the Company 's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $837.1 million and  $841.1 million, respectively.
        At June 30, 2020, the Company had a notional amount of $100 million  (equivalent to €89.0 million) cross-currency interest rate swaps outsta nding. The Company did not designate the swaps as
a hedging instrument and thus changes in fair value were immediatel y recognized in earnings.
        During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into six  Treasury lock agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate  changes relating to the highly probable issuance of
long-term debt. The total notional amount of the Treasury lock of $250. 0 million was designated as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated trans action and deemed these agreements to be highly
effective.
        The associated unsecured senior note was issued on June 19, 2020 , and the Company has settled these Treasury lock agreements with a  $19.8 million cash payment to the counterparties. The loss
associated with the settlement was recorded in accumulated other c omprehensive loss and will be amortized to interest expense over th e life of the unsecured senior notes, which is 10 years.
Foreign Currency Risk
        The Company manufactures and sells its products and finances opera tions in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exp osed to movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging program is to  manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange ra tes.
        To manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward c ontracts. Contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as c ash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in accumulated other comp rehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and reclassified into
earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same  period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect  earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in earnings over
the life of the hedging relationship in the same consolidated stateme nt of income line item as the underlying hedged item. Changes in th e fair value of forward contracts that have not been designated
as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolida ted statement of income.
        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of the outstanding forwa rd contracts was $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
        The Company manages its currency exposure related to the net ass ets of its foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant currency. Foreign currency gains and
losses from the remeasurement of external borrowings designated as net  investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in AOCI, to the ext ent that the hedge is effective. The ineffective
portion is immediately recognized in other non-operating income (loss),  net in the consolidated
75
statement of income. When a hedged net investment is disposed of, a pe rcentage of the cumulative amount recognized in AOCI in relation to the hedged net investment is recognized in the condensed
consolidated statement of income as part of the profit or loss on disposal .
        At the beginning of fiscal year 2020, the carrying value of commercia l paper issued which is designated as a net investment hedge was $67.0  million. During the three months ended December
31, 2019, the Company settled $67.0 million of U.S. commercial paper issue d by a non-U.S. entity, which was previously designated as a net investmen t hedge in its U.S. subsidiaries. The net
investment hedges recorded through the point of settlement are included  in AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings only upon the sale or liqui dation of the related subsidiaries. The Company did
not have any net investment hedges in place as of June 30, 2020.
Commodity Risk
        Certain raw materials used in the Company's production processes a re subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions,  political and economic variables and other unpredictable
factors. The Company's policy is to minimize exposure to price vol atility by passing through the commodity price risk to customers, including the use of fixed price swaps. The Company purchases
on behalf of customers fixed price commodity swaps to offset the exp osure of price volatility on the underlying sales contracts, these ins truments are cash closed out on maturity and the related cost
or benefit is passed through to customers. Information about commodity pri ce exposure is derived from supply forecasts submitted by customers and t hese exposures are hedged by a central treasury
unit. Changes in the fair value of commodity hedges are recognized in AOCI. T he cumulative amount of the hedge is recognized in the consolidated st atement of income when the forecast transaction
is realized.
        At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had the following outstanding commod ity contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted purchases:

        Where funded, the Company and, in some countries, the employees mak e cash contributions into the pension fund. In the case of unfunded plans, th e Company is responsible for benefit
payments as they fall due. Plan funding requirements are generally de termined by local regulation and/or best practice and differ between co untries. The local statutory funding positions are not
necessarily consistent with the funded status disclosed on the co nsolidated balance sheet. For any funded plans in deficit (as meas ured under local country guidelines), the Company agrees with the
trustees and plan fiduciaries to undertake suitable funding programs t o provide additional contributions over time in accordance with local  country requirements. Contributions to the Company's
defined benefit pension plans, not including unfunded plans, are expe cted to be $24.2 million over the next fiscal year.

on plan assets at each measurement date, the Company considers th e plan assets' historical returns, asset allocations, and the antic ipated future economic environment and long-term performance of
the asset classes. While appropriate consideration is given to re cent and historical investment performance, the assumption represe nts management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return .

Forward contracts to purchase own shares
        The Company's employee share plans require the delivery of shares  to employees in the future when rights vest or vested options are exerci sed. The Company currently acquires shares on the
open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercisi ng commitments. This exposes the Company to market price risk.
        To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forw ard contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of June 30, 2020, the C ompany has entered into forward contracts
that mature in June 2021 to purchase 2.0 million shares at an average  price of $10.68. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding forward contra cts for 1.0 million shares at a price of $11.00
that matured in June 2020.
        The forward contracts to purchase the Company's own shares are classifi ed as a current liability. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fa ir value of the shares at inception. The carrying
value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based o n the present value of the cost required to settle the contract.

        Amcor operates in over forty different jurisdictions with a wide range of st atutory tax rates. The tax expense from operating in non-UK jurisdictions i n excess of the UK statutory tax rate is
included in the line "Foreign tax rate differential" in the above tax rate reconciliation table. For fiscal year 2020, the Company's effective t ax rate was 22.6% as compared to the effective tax rates of
28.4% and 16.4% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fiscal  year 2020 foreign tax rate differential reflects a benefit related to Swiss  tax law changes, which was mostly offset by current
period tax charges related to true-up adjustments. Refer to the sect ion "Swiss Tax Reform" in this footnote for a discussion of the benefit rea lized for Swiss tax law changes which the Company
recognized in fiscal year 2020.
        For fiscal year 2020, the Company's effective tax rate for the year was hig her than its UK statutory tax rate primarily due to pretax income being e arned in jurisdictions outside of the UK where
the applicable tax rates are higher than the UK statutory tax rate.

Net deferred tax liability $ (537.0) $ (820.8)
        Deferred tax liabilities relating to other intangible assets is s hown net of a deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform which was recorded  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and
reflected in the balance as at June 30, 2020. A valuation allowa nce is recorded against the deferred tax asset to bring the net amount recorded to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Refer
to the section titled "Swiss Tax Reform" for more information. 
        The Company maintains a valuation allowance on net operating l osses and other deferred tax assets in jurisdictions for which it does not be lieve it is more likely than not to realize those deferred
tax assets based upon all available positive and negative eviden ce, including historical operating performance, carry-back periods, reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies
and earnings expectations. The Company's valuation allowance in creased by $72.9 million, increased by $20.4 million and increased  by $5.3 million for fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase of the Company’s valuation allowance for the fiscal year e nded June 30, 2020 is primarily attributed to the valuation allowance on  the deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform.
        The decrease in deferred tax liability related to undistributed fore ign earnings in fiscal year 2020 includes the tax impact of the EC Rem edy sale of $82.5 million.
        As of June 30, 2020, the Company has UK net operating losses (tax effec ted) and tax credits of approximately $2.9 million that do not expire.  The Company has non-UK net operating losses (tax
effected) and other tax attribute carryforwards of $50.9 million, the majority of which do not expire. The Company recorded valuation allowances again st deferred tax assets associated with these net
operating losses and tax credits. The benefits of these carryforwards are dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the jurisdicti ons in which they arose.
        The Company considers the following factors, among others, in eva luating its plans for indefinite reinvestment of its subsidiaries' earni ngs: (i) the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements
of the Company and its subsidiaries, both for the long term and for the short te rm; and (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest earnings  of any subsidiary. The Company has not provided
deferred taxes on approximately $968.2 million of earnings in certain foreign  subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in its  international operations. Upon distribution of such
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject  to incremental foreign tax. It is not practicable to estimate the a mount of
95
foreign tax that might be payable. A cumulative deferred tax liabilit y of $26.9 million has been recorded attributable to undistributed  earnings that the Company has deemed are no longer indefinitely
reinvested. The remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's s ubsidiaries are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested and can be repatriated at no tax cost. Accordingly, there is no provision
for income or withholding taxes on these earnings.
        The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accorda nce with ASC 740, "Income Taxes." At June 30, 2020 and 2019, unrecognized  tax benefits totaled $101.1 million and $102.6
million, respectively, all of which would favorably impact the effe ctive tax rate if recognized.
        The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related  to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the fiscal ye ars ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company's
accrual for interest and penalties for these uncertain tax positions wa s $7.1 million, $13.8 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. The Com pany does not currently anticipate that the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits will result in material changes to its fina ncial position within the next 12 months.
        A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized ta x benefits for the years presented is as follows:
June 30,
(in millions) 2020 2019 2018
Balance at the beginning of the year $ 102.6  $ 74.5  $ 65.1

Additions related to acquisitions — 29.7 — 
Balance at the end of the year $ 101.1  $ 102.6  $ 74.5  
        The Company conducts business in a number of tax jurisdictions and, as such, is required to file income tax returns in multiple jurisdic tions globally. The years 2016 through 2019 remain open
for examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the  year 2019 remains open for examination by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Cust oms ("HMRC") and the years 2011 through
2019 are currently subject to audit or remain open for examination in variou s U.S. states and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
        The Company believes that its income tax reserves are adequately  maintained taking into consideration both the technical merits  of its tax return positions and ongoing developments in its
income tax audits. However, the final determination of the Company' s tax return positions, if audited, is uncertain and therefore there is a possibility that final resolution of these matters could have a
material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flo ws.
Swiss Tax Reform
        During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, Swiss tax laws were changed in  order to remove certain tax regimes and replace these with new measure s that are hereafter referred to as "Swiss Tax
Reform." In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company obtained confi rmation from local authorities as to the methodology to calculate th e future benefits and recorded the impact. The net
impact was a benefit of $21.7 million, which consisted of a reductio n in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for t ax purposes.

Note 17 - Share-based Compensation
        The Company's equity incentive plans include grants of share opt ions, restricted shares/units, performance shares, performance rights an d share rights to directors, officers and employees. In
certain countries and in selected cases, cash equivalent awards  are provided in the event that the issuance of equity awards is not complia nt with local legislation and tax laws.
Cash-Settled Awards
        Cash-settled awards may be granted to directors, officers and empl oyees of the Company in lieu of, or in addition to, participation in oth er programs.
        Such awards are accounted for as liabilities and are remeasured to fair va lue at each balance sheet date.

Share Options
        In fiscal year 2020, share options were granted to officers and emplo yees. The exercise price for shares options was set at the time of grant . There were no share options granted in fiscal year
2019 as they were deferred due to the transaction with Bemis.
        The requisite service period for outstanding share options in fisc al year 2020 ranges from two to four years. The awards are also subject to p erformance and market conditions. At vesting, share
options can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one ba sis, subject to payment of the exercise price. The maximum contractu al term of the share options in fiscal year 2020
ranges from five to seven years from the grant date.
        The fair value of the share options granted in fiscal year 2020 was es timated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that us es the assumptions noted in the following table to produce a
Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of share options granted was est imated using the following assumptions:
June 30,
2020 2019
Expected dividend yield (%) (1) 4.6 % N/A
Expected share price volatility (%) (2) 18.0 % N/A
Risk-free interest rate (%) (3) 1.8 % N/A
Expected life of options (in years) (4) 5.7 N/A
(1) Determined assuming no change in dividend payout during the expected term of the option.
(2) Determined based on the observed historical volatility for the Company's ordinary share price.
(3) Determined based on the yields on U.S. Treasury Bonds in effect at the time of grant with maturities approximately equal to the share options' expected term.
(4) Determined considering the options' contractual terms, historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns.
        The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each report ing period and adjusts compensation expense based on its probability  assessment.

Performance Rights and Performance Shares
        In fiscal year 2020, performance rights or performance shares (awarded to U.S . participants in place of performance rights) were granted to officers an d employees. There were no performance
rights or performance shares granted in fiscal year 2019 as they were deferre d due to the transaction with Bemis.
        The requisite service period for outstanding performance rights or performanc e shares in fiscal year 2020 ranges from two to four years. The awards are als o subject to performance and market
conditions. At vesting, performance rights can be exercised and conve rted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Performance shares vest automat ically and convert to ordinary shares on a one-
for-one basis. There is no amount payable by the participant.
        The fair value of the performance rights and performance shares granted in fiscal year 2020 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing  model that uses the assumptions noted in the

Note 18 - Earnings Per Share Computations
        The Company applies the two-class method when computing its e arnings per share ("EPS"), which requires that net income per share for each c lass of share be calculated assuming all of the
Company's net income is distributed as dividends to each class of share based on their contractual rights.
        Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to ord inary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstan ding after excluding the ordinary shares to be
repurchased using forward contracts. Diluted EPS includes the effects of share options, restricted shares, performance rights, performance share s and share rights, if dilutive.

Note 19 - Contingencies and Legal Proceedings
Contingencies - Brazil
        The Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various go vernmental assessments and litigation, principally related to cl aims for excise and income taxes. The Company will vigorously
defend its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all , of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under custo mary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may n eed to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to
any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court sys tem; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentia lly required to be pledged would not significantly impact the
liquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorde d an accrual of $11.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, includ ed in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet and has estimated a reasonably possible loss exp osure in excess of the accrual of $18.4 million and $23.7 million,  respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertaintie s
and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicte d. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to probability of ul timately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of
the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultima te loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its kno wledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these
matters may differ from the Company's estimates.
        As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided letters of credit of $34.0 millio n, judicial insurance of $0.9 million and deposited cash of $10.1 mill ion with the courts to continue to defend the cases
referenced above.
Contingencies - Environmental Matters
        The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentiall y responsible party ("PRP") at several waste disposal sites under U.S.  federal and related state environmental statutes and
regulations and may face potentially material environmental rem ediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms  of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or only partially,
cover the total potential exposures. The Company has recorded $17.1 m illion aggregate accruals for its share of estimated future remediation c osts as these sites.
        In addition to the matters described above, the Company has also re corded aggregate accruals of $46.6 million for potential liabilities  for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations
that are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated.
        While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate t o cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultim ate payments will not exceed the accrued amounts. Nevertheless,
based on the available information, the Company does not believe that  its potential environmental obligations will have a material adve rse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial
condition.
Legal Proceedings
        On April 18, 2019, prior to the closure of the Amcor and Bemis transaction , litigation funding firm, Burford Capital, notified Bemis on behalf of two shareholder funds (BCIM Strategic Value
Master Fund LP and BCIM SV SMA I LLC) that the funds would not accept the fixed e xchange ratio for Amcor shares and instead intended to file a case aski ng a Missouri state court to appraise the
value of their Bemis shares and compensate them accordingly. On June 24, 201 9, the Burford funds sent a formal written demand for payment of the fair value of the funds’ shares. On September 6,
2019, the Burford funds filed a Petition for Appraisal of Stock in the Missouri court. On  November 4, 2019, Bemis filed an Answer to the Petition for Appraisal of Stock. On June 24, 2020, the
parties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release  of all claims and two days later the case was dismissed with prejud ice.
        Two lawsuits brought by purported holders of Bemis stock against Bem is and Bemis directors and officers are pending in federal court in the U .S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York, in which plaintiffs are seeking damages for alleged violations of t he Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.
Plaintiffs allege a failure to disclose adequately information in the proxy statement issued in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merge r. The cases are: Dixon, et al. v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al.  and
Stein v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al ., which were instituted on April 15, 2019 and April 17, 2019, respectivel y. On March 10, 2020 the federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York consolidated the two pending cases into a single clas s action.
102
        In addition, a purported holder of Bemis stock filed a putative derivati ve suit in the Cole County Circuit Court, Nineteenth Judicial District of Missouri, against Bemis directors and Amcor,
alleging that the directors breached fiduciary duties in connection with  the Amcor-Bemis merger and that Amcor aided and abetted breaches of fidu ciary duty. The case is Scarantino, et al. v. Amcor
Limited, et al. , which was instituted on April 19, 2019.
        The Company intends to defend the claims made in the pending a ctions. It is too early for the Company to provide any reliable assessment  of the likely quantum of any damages that may
become payable if its defense is unsuccessful in whole or in part. Al though it is not possible at present to establish a reliable asses sment of damages, there can be no assurance that any damages that
may be awarded will not be material to the results of operations or fina ncial condition of the Company.
103
Note 20 - Segments
        The Company's business is organized and presented in the t wo reportable segments outlined below:
Flexibles:  Consists of operations that manufacture flexible and film packaging in  the food and beverage, medical and pharmaceutical, fresh produce, snack food , personal care, and other industries.
Rigid Packaging:  Consists of operations that manufacture rigid plastic containers for a b road range of predominantly beverage and food products, including carbonated soft drinks, water, juices,
sports drinks, milk-based beverages, spirits and beer, sauces, dressi ngs, spreads and personal care items and plastic caps for a wide variety of a pplications.
        Other consists of the Company's equity method investments, incl uding AMVIG, undistributed corporate expenses, intercompany eliminati ons and other business activities.
        Operating segments are organized along the Company's product lin es and geographical areas. In conjunction with the acquisition of Be mis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting
structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate  the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North Am erica and Flexibles Latin America. The five Flexibles
operating segments (Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles North  America, Flexibles Latin America; Flexibles Asia Pacific and S pecialty Cartons) have been aggregated in the Flexibles
reporting segment as they exhibit similarity in economic characte ristics and future prospects, similarity in the products they offer, t heir production technologies, the customers they serve, the nature of
their service delivery models, and their regulatory environments.
        In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in connection with the acquisi tion of Bemis, the Company changed its measure of segment performance from adjusted operating income to adjusted
earnings before interest and tax ("Adjusted EBIT") from continuing operation s. The Company's chief operating decision maker, the Global Manage ment Team ("GMT"), evaluates performance and
allocates resources based on Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations.  The Company defines Adjusted EBIT as operating income adjusted to e liminate the impact of certain items that the Company
does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance and to include equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies. The GMT cons ists of the Managing Director and Chief Executive
Officer and his direct reports and provides strategic direction and mana gement oversight of the day to day activities of the Company.
        The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same  as those in the consolidated financial statements and are disc ussed in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies." The Company
also has investments in operations in AMVIG that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are n ot included in segment net sales.

        None.
Item 9A. - Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
        Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Of ficer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of o ur disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020.
The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Ex change Act"), means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required  to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's ru les and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limi tation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that i t files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and commun icated to our management, including its principal
executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decis ions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any cont rols and procedures, no matter how well designed, and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objec tives and management necessarily applies its judgement in e valuating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Ch ief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure  controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30,
2020 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting  that was identified in our prospectus filed with the SEC on March 25, 2019 a nd is still being remediated, as described
below.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over fina ncial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reportin g is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accep ted accounting principles. Our management evaluated the design a nd operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadwa y Commission
(the "COSO framework" (2013)).
        Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and proce dures that:
• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accu rately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the as sets of the Company;
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as nece ssary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance  with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and
expenditures are being made only in
accordance with management and directors of the Company's authorizati on; and
• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detecti on of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material e ffect on the financial statements.
        A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencie s, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reas onable possibility that a material misstatement of the
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detecte d on a timely basis. All internal control systems, no matter how well des igned, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even
effective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable a ssurance with respect to financial statement preparation and prese ntation.
        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness arising from  deficiencies in the design
and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end report ing process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were
appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation a nd reporting of financial information. This control deficiency did not res ult in a misstatement of our consolidated financial
statements. However, the control deficiency could have resulted in misstatements of our interim or annual consolidated financial sta tements and disclosures that may have not been prevented or
detected on a timely basis.
113
        Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, inc luding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we c onducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. Based on this  evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effe ctive internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2020 given a previously identified material weakness had not been re mediated as of fiscal 2020 year end.
        The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, an independ ent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears on "Item 8. - Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness
        We are currently in the process of remediating the material weakness re lated to deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over period end reporting through a
process to (i) develop and implement additional controls and procedures  to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key IT syst ems, which includes the implementation of new
security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitori ng where practical, (ii) design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and (iii) develop training on
segregation of duties.  Given we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fis cal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in
fiscal 2021.  These enhanced processes, including the implementation of new mi tigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weakn ess, but the material weakness will not be considered
remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period o f time and we have concluded, through testing, they are designed and o perating effectively.  We currently expect that the
remediation of this material weakness will be completed by the e nd of fiscal 2021.  However, there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fu lly remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the
severity and length of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic is u nknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impa cted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-19
limitations on travel, meetings and on-site work.
Completed Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness
        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness related t o a lack of experience in
technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and U.S. domestic registrant filing require ments. Since the material weakness has been identified, we have take n numerous steps to address the underlying causes
and to remediate the material weakness. We have hired additional fi nancial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and  financial reporting experience, as well as U.S. domestic
registrant filing experience, aligned our accounting policies and pro cedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the fi nancial close process with U.S. GAAP experienced
staff, and have conducted technical training for accounting and financ e personnel. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, we completed our testing o f the operating effectiveness of the implemented
steps and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded t he material weakness has been remediated as of June 30, 2020.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
        Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal cont rol over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the  Exchange Act) that occurred during the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonabl y likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial report ing.

EXHIBIT 4.26
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTIO N 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
As of June 30, 2020, Amcor plc (“Amcor,” “we,” “our” or “us”) had two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”):
(i) Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share and (ii) 1.125% Guaranteed Senior Notes  due 2027. Each of Amcor’s securities registered under Section 12 of the E xchange Act are listed on the New
York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDI’s”) represen ting our ordinary shares are traded on the Australian Securities Exchan ge (“ASX”).
DESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES
The following is a summary of the material terms of our ordinary shares as s et forth in our Articles of Association and the material provisions of the laws  of Jersey, Channel Islands. This summary
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by referen ce to our Articles of Association, which are filed as an exhibit to the Annua l Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.26
is a part.
Share Capital
The authorized share capital of Amcor is $100,000,000, divided into 9,000,000 ,000 ordinary shares of $0.01 par value each and 1,000,000,000 preferred shares of $0.0 1 par value each, which may be
issued in such class or classes or series as the our board of directors (“ board”) may determine in accordance with our Articles of Association. As of Aug ust 25, 2020, we had 1,568,481,519 ordinary
shares issued and outstanding.
All ordinary shares have equal voting rights and no right to a fixed inco me and carry the right to receive dividends that have been declared b y Amcor. The holders of ordinary shares have the right to
receive notice of, and to attend and vote at, all general meetings of Amc or. The rights and obligations attaching to any preferred shares will be de termined at the time of issue by our board in its
absolute discretion and must be set forth in a statement of rights. Any  preferred shares that are issued may have priority over the ordinary shares wi th respect to dividend or liquidation rights or both.
We do not have any preferred shares issued and outstanding.
Our board may issue ordinary shares or preferred shares without further sharehol der action, unless shareholder action is required by applicable la w or by the rules of the NYSE, ASX or other stock
exchange or quotation system on which any class or series of our ordinary sh ares may be listed or quoted.
Subject to our Articles of Association and the rights or restrictions atta ched to any shares or class of shares, if Amcor is wound up and the property  of Amcor available for distribution among the
shareholders is more than sufficient to pay (i) all the debts and liabi lities of Amcor and (ii) the costs, charges and expenses of the winding up , the excess must be divided among the shareholders in
proportion to the number of shares held by them, irrespective of the amounts  paid or credited as paid on the shares. If Amcor is wound up, the directors or li quidator (as applicable) may, with the
sanction of a special resolution of the shareholders of Amcor and any other sanction required by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (the “Jersey Compa nies Law”), divide among the shareholders the
whole or any part of the assets of Amcor and determine how the division wil l be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of sharehol ders.
CDIs are units of beneficial ownership in shares constituted under Australian l aw which may be held and transferred through the CHESS system. For further informatio n regarding the CDIs, see "—
CHESS Depositary Interests" below. All references to shares in this summary wi ll be deemed, where the context permits, also to be references to the  CDIs.
Amcor's registered office address and the address where Amcor's registe r of members is maintained is 3rd Floor 44 Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey  JE4 9WG.
Organizational Documents; Governing Law
The rights of Amcor shareholders are governed by, among other things, our Artic les of Association and the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, including the Jersey Companies Law.
Voting Rights
Each ordinary share entitles the holder to one vote per share at any gene ral meeting of shareholders. An ordinary resolution requires approval by the hol ders of a majority of the voting rights
represented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting thereon. A speci al resolution requires approval by the holders of two-thirds of the voting  rights represented at a meeting, in person or by
proxy, and voting thereon (or such greater majority as the Articles of Associat ion may prescribe).
V oting rights with respect to any class of preferred shares (if any) will be d etermined by our board and set out in the relevant statement of rights fo r such class.
Neither Jersey law nor the Articles of Association restrict non-resident  shareholders from holding or exercising voting rights in relation of our ordina ry shares. There are no provisions in the Jersey
Companies Law relating to cumulative voting.
No Preemptive Rights
Amcor shareholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire newly issued  ordinary shares.
Variation of Rights
The rights attached to any class of ordinary shares, such as voting, divi dends and the like, may, unless their terms of issue state otherwise , be varied by a special resolution passed at a separate
meeting of the holders of shares of such class.
Certificated and Uncertificated Shares
Ordinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. E very holder of certificated shares is entitled, without payment, to  have a certificate for the shares that it owns executed under
Amcor's seal or in such other manner as provided by the Jersey Companies  Law.
Transfer of Shares
Generally, fully paid ordinary shares are issued in registered form and may b e freely transferred pursuant to the Articles of Association unless the t ransfer is restricted by applicable securities laws or
prohibited by another instrument.
Dividends
Our board may declare and pay any dividends from time to time as it may d etermine. Our board may rescind a decision to pay a dividend if it decides , before the payment date, that Amcor's financial
position no longer justifies the payment. The payment of a dividend do es not require shareholder confirmation or approval at a general meeting of th e shareholders.
Holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to receive equally, on a per share  basis, any dividends that may be declared in respect of ordinary shares  by our board.
Our board may direct that a dividend will be satisfied from any availa ble source permitted by law, including wholly or partly by the distribu tion of assets, including paid up shares or securities of
another company. If Amcor declares cash dividends, such dividends wil l be declared in U.S. dollars.
Under the Jersey Companies Law, dividends may be paid from any source pe rmitted by law (other than from nominal capital account and capital redem ption reserve), subject to a requirement for the
directors who are to authorize the payment of any dividend to make a statu tory solvency statement.
Our Articles of Association permit our board to require that all dividen d payments will be paid only through electronic transfer into an account s elected by the shareholder rather than by a bank
check.
No dividend or other monies payable on or in respect of a share will bear in terest as against Amcor (unless the terms of the share specify otherw ise).
If any dividend is unclaimed for 11 calendar months after issuance, our board  may stop payment on the dividend or otherwise make use of the unclaim ed amount for the benefit of Amcor until
claimed or otherwise disposed of according to the laws relating to uncla imed monies.
Alteration of Share Capital
Under the Jersey Companies Law, Amcor may, by special resolution of i ts shareholders: increase its share capital; consolidate and sub-divid e; convert shares into or from stock; re-denominate any of
its shares into another currency or reduce its share capital, capital red emption reserve or share premium account in any way.
Redeemable Shares
Our ordinary shares will not initially be redeemable. Pursuant to the  Jersey Companies Law and our Articles of Association, our board may issu e redeemable shares or convert existing non-
redeemable shares, whether issued or not, into redeemable shares, wh ich shares will be, in each case, redeemable in accordance with thei r terms or at the option of Amcor and/or at the option of the
holder (provided that an issued non-redeemable share may only be converted i nto a redeemable share with the agreement of the holder or pursuant to a spe cial resolution).
Purchase of Own Shares
Subject to the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law and our Articles of As sociation, Amcor may purchase its own shares or CDIs and either cancel t hem or hold them as treasury shares.
Under Jersey law, Amcor's purchase of its own shares must be sanc tioned by a special resolution of Amcor's shareholders. If the purchas e is to be made on a stock exchange, the special resolution
must specify the maximum number of shares or CDIs to be purchased, the maxi mum and minimum prices which may be paid, and the date on which t he authority to purchase is to expire (which may
not be more than five years after the date of the resolution). If the purchase is to  be made otherwise than on a stock exchange, the purchase must be made p ursuant to a written purchase contract
approved in advance by a resolution of shareholders (excluding the shareho lder from whom Amcor proposes to purchase shares or CDIs).
Shareholder Meetings
Annual Meetings of Shareholders
Under Jersey law, Amcor must hold an annual general meeting once eve ry calendar year and not more than 18 months may elapse between two suc cessive annual general meetings, at such date, time
and place as may be determined by our Board.
A general shareholder meeting may only be called by a resolution of th e board or as otherwise provided in the Jersey Companies Law.
Special Meetings of Shareholders
The board may, and upon request of shareholders as required by Jersey law (and  as described below) must, convene an extraordinary general meeting o f the shareholders.
Under the Jersey Companies Law, shareholders of Amcor holding 10% or more  of the company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant mee ting may legally require the directors to call a
meeting of shareholders. Upon receiving a requisition notice from sharehol ders, the board must call a special meeting as soon as practicab le but in any case not later than two months after the date of
the requisition. If the directors do not within 21 days from the date of the de posit of the requisition proceed to call a meeting to be held within t wo months of that date, the requisitionists, or any of
them representing more than half of the total voting rights of all of the m, may themselves call a meeting, but a meeting so called may no t be held after three months from that date.
Notice of Meetings; Record Date
Under the Articles of Association and applicable stock exchange l isting rules, the notice for a general meeting must be sent to all sha reholders. The content of a notice of a general meeting called by
the board is to be decided by the board, but it must designate the me eting as an annual or extraordinary general meeting and must state the  general nature of the business to be transacted at the
meeting and any other matters required by the Jersey Companies Law.
For the purpose of determining whether a person is entitled as a sharehold er to attend or vote at a meeting and how many votes such person ma y cast, Amcor may specify in the notice a date not more
than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date fixed for the meeting, as t he date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to receive not ice of, attend or vote at the meeting or appoint a
proxy. Amcor may specify a separate time by which a CDI holder must be o n the CDI register in order to direct the Depositary Nominee (as defined  herein) to vote or appoint a proxy.
Quorum
Under the Articles of Association, no business may be transacted a t any general meeting unless a quorum (the holders of shares representing  at least the majority of total voting rights of all
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting) is present in person o r by proxy at the time when the meeting proceeds to business.
Action by Written Consent
The Articles of Association prohibit actions to be taken by unanimous  written consent. Under the Articles of Association, any action required or pe rmitted to be taken by shareholders or any class of
them must be effected at a general meeting of Amcor or of the class in que stion and may not be effected by any consent or resolution in writin g of the shareholders.
Shareholder Proposals
Under Articles of Association, a shareholder of record who has the right to vo te at an annual general meeting may, on giving notice to Amcor no more t han 120 days and no less than 90 days before
the date which is one year after the date of the previous annual general mee ting, require Amcor to include a resolution to be proposed at the annu al general meeting. Any proposed business must be a
proper matter for shareholder action.
In addition, a shareholder of record who has the right to vote at general meet ings may propose persons for nomination as directors subject to com plying with the applicable requirements to be set
forth in the Articles of Association, including delivery to Amcor of spec ified information on director nominees. Shareholder nominations mus t be made on notice of (i) in the case of annual general
meetings, no more than 120 calendar days and no less than 90 days (in eac h case from the anniversary date of the preceding annual general meet ing), or (ii) in the case of extraordinary general
meetings called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the  10th day following the day on which notice of the date of such meeting wa s mailed.
Conditions of Admission
Under the Articles of Association, the board and the chairperson of any g eneral meeting may make any arrangement and impose any requirement or re striction it or he or she considers appropriate to
ensure the safety of persons attending and the orderly conduct of a general m eeting including, without limitation, requirements for identifi cation to be produced by those attending the meeting,
searches and the restriction of items that may be taken into the me eting place. The board and, at any general meeting, the chairperson are e ntitled to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply
with these arrangements, requirements or restrictions.
Board of Directors
Election of Directors
Amcor directors are appointed by Amcor's board of directors and shall hold offic e until the next annual general meeting following such appointment. Un der the Articles of Association, all directors
are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Directors will hol d office until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting foll owing his or her appointment, unless such director is re-elected
at the general meeting.
Where the number of persons validly proposed for election or re-election as a  director is greater than the number of directors to be elected, the person s receiving the most votes (up to the number of
directors to be elected) will be elected as directors and an absolute m ajority of votes cast will not be a pre-requisite to the election of su ch directors.
Removal of Directors
Under the Articles of Association, a director may only be removed from offi ce by ordinary resolution of Amcor shareholders as a result of:
• the director's conviction (with a plea of nolo contendere deemed to b e a conviction) of a serious felony involving moral turpitude or a violatio n of U.S. federal or state securities law, but
excluding a conviction based entirely on vicarious liability; or
• the director's commission of any material act of dishonesty (such as embezzlement) resulting or intended to result in material persona l gain or enrichment of the director at the expense of the
Company or any subsidiary and which act, if made the subject to crimi nal charges, would be reasonably likely to be charged as a felony.
For these purposes nolo contendere, felony and moral turpitude have the me aning given to them by the laws of the United States of America or any relev ant state thereof and shall include equivalent
acts in any other jurisdiction.
Vacancies
The Articles of Association provide that any vacancy occurring on the Amcor board (whether caused by increase in size of the Amcor board, or by death, disabi lity, resignation, removal or otherwise)
shall only be filled by a majority of the Amcor board then in office, even  though fewer than a quorum.
Any directors appointed by the Amcor board to fill a vacancy will hold o ffice until the next annual general meeting following his or her appoin tment.
Business Combinations with Interested Shareholders
Under the Articles of Association, Amcor is prohibited from engaging in an y business combination with any "interested shareholder" for a period of thre e years following the time that such
shareholder became an interested shareholder (subject to certain s pecified exceptions), unless (in addition to other exceptions) prior to su ch business combination the board approved either the
business combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholde r becoming an "interested shareholder."
An "interested shareholder" is (subject to certain specified exceptions ) any person (together with its affiliates and associates) that (i) own s more than 15% of Amcor's voting stock or (ii) is an affiliate
or associate of Amcor and owned more than 15% of Amcor's voting stock within t hree years of the date on which it is sought to be determined whether suc h person is an "interested shareholder."
Disclosure of Shareholding Ownership
Holders of beneficial interests in Amcor ordinary shares must comply with th e beneficial ownership disclosure obligations contained in sectio n 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated
thereunder.
Under the Articles of Association, Amcor may, by written notice, requi re any person whom Amcor knows or has reasonable cause to believe to ho ld an interest in Amcor ordinary shares or to have
held an interest at any time during the three years prior, to confirm whe ther that is the case and give further information as to their interest  as requested.
Where a person fails to comply with such notice within the reasonable  time period specified in the notice or has made a statement which is  false or inadequate, then, unless the Amcor board
determines otherwise, the following restrictions will apply to the appl icable shares and to any new shares issued in right of those shares  for so long as such person remains in default under the notice:
• no voting rights will be exercisable in respect of those shares;
• any dividend or other distribution payable in respect of those shares wil l be withheld by Amcor without interest; and
• no transfer of those shares will be registered except for an "excepted transfer" .
An "excepted transfer" means a transfer:
• pursuant to acceptance of a takeover offer under the Jersey Companies  Law;
• made through the NYSE, ASX or any other stock exchange on which Amcor ordina ry shares are normally traded; or
• of the whole of a person's beneficial interest in the shares to an unaf filiated third party.
CHESS Depositary Interests
CDIs are quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX. Ordinary  shares are not traded on the financial market operated by the ASX. This i s because ASX's electronic settlement system,
known as CHESS, cannot be used directly for the transfer of securities of issue rs, such as Amcor, incorporated in countries whose laws do not recognize CHE SS as a system to record uncertificated
holdings or to electronically transfer legal title. CDIs have been crea ted to facilitate electronic settlement and transfer in Australia for co mpanies in this situation.
CDIs are a type of depositary receipt which provide the holder with ultima te beneficial ownership of the underlying ordinary shares of Amcor. The leg al title to these ordinary shares is held by Cede
& Co., with CHESS Depositary Nominees Pty Ltd (ABN 75 071 346 506), a whol ly-owned subsidiary of ASX, which we refer to as the “Depositary Nominee,” h olding the beneficial title to those
ordinary shares on behalf of CDI holders.
Each CDI represents a beneficial interest in one ordinary share and, unli ke ordinary shares, each CDI can be held, transferred and settled electronical ly through CHESS.
CDIs are traded electronically on the financial market operated by the  ASX. However, there are a number of differences between holding CDIs and ordinary  shares. The major differences are that:
• CDI holders do not have legal title in the underlying ordinary shares to wh ich the CDIs relate (the chain of title in the ordinary shares underl ying the CDIs is summarized above);
• CDI holders are not able to vote personally as shareholders at a meeti ng of Amcor. Instead, CDI holders are provided with a voting instruction form w hich will enable them to instruct the
Depositary Nominee in relation to the exercise of voting rights. In additi on, a CDI holder is able to request the Depositary Nominee to appoint th e CDI holder or a third party nominated by
the CDI holder as its proxy so that the proxy so appointed may exercise t he votes attaching to the ordinary shares; and
• CDI holders will not be directly entitled to certain other rights conferre d on holders of ordinary shares, including the right to apply to a Jersey co urt for an order on the grounds that the affairs
of Amcor are being conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the i nterests of Amcor shareholders; and the right to apply to the Jersey Finan cial Services Commission to have an
inspector appointed to investigate the affairs of Amcor.
Alternatively, CDI holders can convert their CDIs into Amcor ordinary share s in sufficient time before the relevant meeting, in which case the y will be able to vote personally as shareholders of
Amcor.
Application of Standard Table
The "standard table" of provisions under the Jersey Companies Law do es not apply.
DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES
The following description of the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes ”) issued by Amcor UK Finance plc, a subsidiary of Amcor (the “Issuer”) summarizes  certain material terms of the Notes.
This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the inde nture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of wh ich this Exhibit 4.26 is a part.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 23, 2020 am ong the Issuer, Amcor, AFUI, Amcor Pty Ltd and Bemis, as guarantors, and De utsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by an officer's certificat e, dated as of June 23, 2020. We refer to the original indenture, as supplem ented, as the indenture. The terms of the Notes include
those stated in the indenture and those made part of the indentu re by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"). A copy of t he indenture may be obtained from the Issuer or
the Trustee.
The Issuer issued the Notes in fully registered form in denominations of € 100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes were  issued in the form of one or more global note,
without coupons, which were deposited initially with, or on behalf of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the com mon depositary, for, and in respect of interests held
through, Euroclear and Clearstream. There is no security register for the Notes  in the United Kingdom or
Australia. The Trustee acts as paying agent, transfer agent and regis trar for the Notes. The Notes may be presented for registration of transfer and exch ange at the offices of the registrar. The Issuer
may change the paying agent, transfer agent and registrar without notic e to holders of the Notes, and may change the paying agent upon notice  to the Trustee.
General
Unless earlier redeemed in the circumstances set out below, the Not es will mature on June 23, 2027 at a price equal to 100% of their principa l amount.
The Notes were offered in the principal amount of €500,000,000.
In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal amount of, or a ny premium or interest with respect to, the Notes or the date fixed for redemp tion of the Notes, shall not be a Business
Day, then payment of the principal amount, premium, if any, or interest, including any Additional Amounts (as defined below) payable in respect th ereto may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date for su ch payment or the date fixed for redemption, and no interest shall accrue  for the period after such date.
The Notes are not entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. The Note s are subject to defeasance as described under "—Defeasance and cov enant defeasance.”
Interest
The Notes bear interest from the date of issuance, payable annually on  June 23 of each year, beginning June 23, 2021, to the persons in whose na mes such Notes are registered at the close of business
on the date that is (i) in the case of Notes represented by a global note, the clearing system business day (for this purpose, a day on which Clea rstream and Euroclear settle payments in euro)
immediately preceding the relevant interest payment and (ii) in a ll other cases, 15 calendar days prior to the relevant interest payment dat e (whether or not a Business Day) (for the purposes of clauses
(i) and (ii), such day, the "Record Date"). Interest on the Notes will be compute d on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest  is being calculated and the actual number of
days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on th e Notes (or June 23, 2020, if no interest has been paid on the applicable Notes ), to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest
payment date. This payment convention is referred to as Actual/Actual  (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Associat ion.
If any interest payment date would otherwise be a day that is not a B usiness Day, such interest payment date will be postponed to the next  date that is a Business Day and no interest will accrue on the
amounts payable from and after such interest payment date to the next B usiness Day. If the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not  a Business Day, the related payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next Business Day as i f it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will a ccrue on the amounts so payable for the period from
and after such date to the next Business Day.
Issuance in euro
All payments of interest, premium, if any, and principal, including paym ents made upon any redemption or repurchase of the Notes, will be made in euro; provided that if the euro is unavailable to us
due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances bey ond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member st ates of the European Monetary Union that have
adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions  by public institutions of or within the international banking communit y, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made
in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such c ircumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be convert ed into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of the close of business on th e second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, if the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has
not announced a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior t o the second Business Day prior to the relevant
payment date or, in the event The Wall Street Journal has not publis hed such exchange rate, the rate will be determined in our sole discre tion on the basis of the most recently available market
exchange rate for the euro. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made i n U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the ind enture). Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent
shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.
As of August 14, 2020, the rate published by the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System for the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate was €1 = U.S. $1.18 33.
Further issues
The indenture provides that the Notes may be issued from time to time  without limitation as to aggregate principal amount. Therefore, in the  future, the Issuer may, without the consent of the holders
of the Notes, create and issue under the indenture additional debt se curities having the same terms and conditions as the Notes (except for t he issue date and, under certain circumstances, the first date
of interest accrual, the first interest payment date and terms relating  to restrictions on transfer or registration rights), provided that if such ad ditional debt securities are not fungible with the Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional debt securities will h ave a different CUSIP number from the Notes. We refer to any such additional de bt securities, as "Additional Notes". Any
Additional Notes of a series will form a single series of debt secu rities with the Notes.
Guarantee
Under the Guarantee, each of Amcor, Amcor Finance (USA), Inc. (“AFUI”), Amcor Pty Ltd a nd Bemis Company, Inc. (“Bemis,” and collectively, the “Guarantors”) wil l fully and unconditionally
guarantee the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest, pre mium (if any) and all other amounts due under the indenture and on the Notes  when the Notes become due and payable, whether
at maturity, pursuant to optional redemption, by acceleration or oth erwise, in each case after any applicable grace periods or notice requirem ents, according to the terms of the Notes.
The obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantee are unconditio nal, regardless of the enforceability of the Notes, and will not be dischar ged until all obligations under the Notes and the
indenture are satisfied. Holders of the Notes may proceed directly agains t the Guarantors under the Guarantee if an event of default affecting  the Notes occurs without first proceeding against the
Issuer.
Additional subsidiary guarantors
Amcor has covenanted and agreed under the indenture that it will ca use each of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer and any Subsidiary that  is already a Guarantor under the indenture) that at any
time has outstanding a guarantee with respect to any Specified Ind ebtedness, or is otherwise an obligor, a co-obligor or jointly liable with the Issuer or any applicable Guarantor with respect to any
Specified Indebtedness, to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supple mental indenture within 30 days of such Subsidiary guaranteeing, or otherwise becoming an obligor, a co-obligor or jointly liable
with the Issuer or any applicable Guarantor in respect of, such Specifi ed Indebtedness, pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee t he Notes issued under the indenture on the same terms and
subject to the same conditions and limitations as set forth in the i ndenture.
Any supplemental indenture entered into in accordance with the inden ture in connection with the provision of a Guarantee by an additional  Subsidiary Guarantor may include a limitation on such
Subsidiary Guarantee that is required under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is incorporated or organized, provided that such l imitation shall also be contained in any other
guarantee provided by such Subsidiary in respect of any Specified Indebtedn ess.
Release of subsidiary guarantors
As more fully described in the indenture, any Subsidiary of Amcor that provides a  Guarantee in respect of the Notes (a "Subsidiary Guarantor") may be relea sed at any time from its Guarantee
without the consent of any holder of the Notes if, at such time, no Defaul t or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and either (a) such Sub sidiary Guarantor is no longer, or at the time of
release will no longer be, a Subsidiary of Amcor or (b) such Subsidiary Guarantor shal l not have outstanding a guarantee with respect to any Specified Indebtedn ess or otherwise be an obligor, co-
obligor or jointly liable with respect to any Specified Indebtedness (or sha ll be released with respect to its Guarantee under the indenture simultane ously with its release under guarantees or other
obligations with respect to all Specified Indebtedness).
Ranking
The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank on a parity basis  with all of the Issuer's other unsecured and unsubordinated obligatio ns, and each of the Guarantees are an unsecured
obligation of the applicable Guarantor and rank on a parity basis with  all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor except, in each case, indebtedness mandatorily preferred
by law.
The Notes are effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured  obligations of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets se curing any such obligations, and since the Notes are
unsecured obligations of the Issuer, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolv ency, the Issuer's secured lenders will have a prior secured claim to an y collateral securing the obligations owed to them.
Each of the Guarantees are effectively subordinated to any existing  and future secured obligations of the applicable Guarantor to the extent  of the value of the assets securing such obligations, and
since each of the Guarantees is an unsecured obligation of the corresp onding Guarantor, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, each such Guara ntor's secured lenders will have a prior secured
claim to any collateral securing the obligation owed to them. As of Jun e 30, 2020, the Issuer and the Guarantors had no secured indebtedness out standing.
The Notes and each of the related Guarantees are also be structurally  subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilit ies, whether or not secured, of any Subsidiary of Amcor
(other than Amcor UK) that does not guarantee such Notes (including any subsi diaries that Amcor may in the future acquire or establish to the exte nt they do not guarantee such Notes). Amcor,
AFUI, Amcor Pty Ltd and Bemis are the initial Guarantors of the Note s. See "—Guarantees."
As of June 30, 2020, (i) the Issuer and the Guarantors had $6,129.8 million in aggreg ate principal amount of total indebtedness, other than intercompan y indebtedness (of which none was secured)
and (ii) the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including joint ventures, had $104.8  million of total indebtedness (of which $30.5 million was secured). For t he year ended June 30, 2020, the non-guarantor
subsidiaries, including joint ventures, represented 93% of Amcor's sales  revenue.
Registration of transfer and exchange
General
Subject to the limitations applicable to global notes, the Not es may be presented for exchange for other Notes of any authorized denomination s and of a like tenor and aggregate principal amount or
for registration of transfer by the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized  in writing and, if so required by the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Trustee, with the form of transfer thereon duly
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfact ory to the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Registrar (as defined below) duly ex ecuted, at the office of the Registrar or at the
office of any other transfer agent designated by the Issuer or such Guarant ors for such purpose. No service charge will be made for any exchange or regist ration of transfer of the Notes, but the Issuer
or the Guarantors may require payment of a sum by the holder of a Note sufficie nt to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection th erewith.
Such transfer or exchange will be effected upon the Registrar or such t ransfer agent, as the case may be, being satisfied with the document s of title and identity of the person making the request. The
Registrar may decline to accept any request for an exchange or registrat ion of transfer of any Note during the period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment of interest on, principal of or
any other payments on or in respect of the Notes. The Issuer and the Guaranto rs have appointed the Trustee as Registrar (the "Registrar"). The Issuer a nd the Guarantors may at any time designate
additional transfer agents or rescind the designation of any transfer agent  or approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts; provi ded, however, that there shall at all times be a
transfer agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.
Payment of additional amounts
All payments of, or in respect of, principal of, and any premium and intere st on, the Notes, and all payments pursuant to the Guarantees, sha ll be made without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governme ntal charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Uni ted States (including the District of Columbia and
any state, possession or territory thereof), Jersey, Australia, the United Ki ngdom or any other jurisdiction in which the Issuer or the Guarantors bec omes a resident for tax purposes (whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise) or through which the Issuer or any Guara ntor makes payment on the Notes or any Guarantee (each, a "Relevant Jurisdi ction") or any political subdivision or taxing
authority of any of the foregoing, unless such taxes, duties, assessments  or governmental charges are required by the law of the Relevant Jurisdic tion or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein to be withheld or deducted. In that event, the Issuer or th e Guarantors, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts ("Additi onal Amounts") as will result (after deduction of such
taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges and any additi onal taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges payable in re spect of such Additional Amounts) in the payment to the holder
of the Notes of the amounts which would have been payable in respect of such No tes or Guarantee had no such withholding or deduction been required, except  that no Additional Amounts shall be so
payable for or on account of:
(1) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other government al charge which would not have been imposed but for the fact th at such holder or beneficial owner of the Notes:

(c) presented such Note or Guarantee (where presentation is required) m ore than thirty (30) days after the date on which the payment in respect  of such Note or Guarantee first became due
and payable or provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent t hat the holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts  if it had presented such Note or Guarantee for
payment on any day within such period of thirty (30) days; or
(d) with respect to any withholding or deduction of taxes, duties, assessm ents or other governmental charges imposed by the United States, or any of its territories or any political subdivision

United States, engaged in business in the United States, a person wit h a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States, a "t en percent shareholder" of the Issuer or the
Guarantors, a passive foreign investment company, or a controlled foreign corpo ration, or has or has had some other connection with the United States  (other than the mere receipt of a
payment or the ownership of holding a Note;
(2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or si milar tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any withholdin g or deduction on account of such tax, assessment or other
government charge;
(3) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is pa yable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments of (or in re spect of) principal of, or any premium and interest

(4) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other government al charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure to compl y in a timely manner by the holder of such Note or, in
the case of a global security, the beneficial owner of such Global Note , with a timely request of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any Pay ing Agent addressed to such holder or beneficial
owner, as the case may be, (a) to provide information concerning the nationali ty, residence or identity of such holder or such beneficial owner or (b) to ma ke any declaration or other similar claim or
satisfy any information or reporting requirement, which, in the case of (a) or (b), is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or adminis trative practice of any Relevant Jurisdiction or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein as a precond ition to exemption from all or part of such withholding, deduction, tax, du ty, assessment or other governmental charge
(including without limitation the filing of an Internal Revenue Service  ("IRS") Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-9);
(5) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other government al charge which is imposed or withheld by or by reason of the Australian Comm issioner of Taxation giving a notice under
section 255 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) of Australia or section 260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (C th) of Australia or under a similar provision;
(6) any taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or be neficial owner of the Notes to comply with (a) the requirements of Secti ons 1471 through 1474 (commonly known as
"FATCA") of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), a s of the date hereof (or any amended or successor version that is substa ntively comparable and not materially more
onerous to comply with), the U.S. Treasury regulations issued thereunder or a ny official interpretation thereof or any agreement entered into pursuant to  Section 1471 of the Code, (b) any treaty, law,
regulation or other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdicti on or relating to any intergovernmental agreement between the United  States and any other jurisdiction, which, in either case,
facilitates the implementation of clause (a) above and (c) any agreem ent pursuant to the implementation of clauses (a) and (b) above with the  IRS, the U.S. government or any governmental or
taxation authority in any other jurisdiction; or
(7) any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6);
nor shall Additional Amounts be paid with respect to any payment of, or in  respect of, the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any such Note or Gua rantee to any such holder who is a
fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such pa yment to the extent such Note or Guarantee would, under the laws of any Releva nt Jurisdiction or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, be treated as being d erived or received for tax purposes by a beneficiary or settlor with respect t o such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a
beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such Additional A mounts had it been the holder of the Note or Guarantee.
Whenever there is mentioned, in any context, any payment of or in respect  of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Notes (or any payments p ursuant to the Guarantees thereof), such
mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Am ounts provided for in the indenture to the extent that, in such context, Ad ditional Amounts are, were or would be payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the indenture, and any express mention of th e payment of Additional Amounts in any provisions of the indenture shall no t be construed as excluding Additional
Amounts in those provisions of the indenture where such express mention i s not made.
Certain other additional amounts may be payable in respect of Notes  and Guarantees as a result of certain consolidations or mergers invo lving, or conveyances, transfer or leases of properties and
assets by, the Issuer or the Guarantors. See "—Certain covenants—Consol idation, merger and sale of assets.”
Amcor's obligations to pay Additional Amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the indenture and the payment of all other amounts in respect of the Notes.
Redemption for changes in withholding taxes
If, as the result of (a) any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulatio ns, published practice or published tax rulings of any Relevant Jurisdict ion, or of any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or (b) any change in the offi cial administration, application, or interpretation by a relevant court or tribunal, government or government authority of any
Relevant Jurisdiction of such laws, regulations, published practice  or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Notes or t he Guarantees, which change or amendment becomes
effective on or after the later of (x) the original issue date of the Notes or t he Guarantees or (y) the date on which a jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Juri sdiction (whether by consolidation, merger or
transfer of assets of the Issuer or any Guarantor, change in place of payment o n the Notes or any Guarantee or otherwise) or which change in official admini stration, application or interpretation shall
not have been available to the public prior to such later date, the Iss uer or the applicable Guarantors would be required to pay any Additional Amounts  pursuant to the indenture or the terms of any
Guarantee in respect of interest on the next succeeding interest payme nt date (assuming, in the case of the Guarantors, a payment in respect of such interest was required to be made by the applicable
Guarantor under the Guarantee thereof on such interest payment date and the applicable Guarantor would be unable, for reasons outside their control, to p rocure payment by the Issuer), and the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the us e of commercially reasonable measures available to the Issuer or the ap plicable Guarantor, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all
(but not less than all) of the corresponding Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more  than 60 days' written notice as provided in the indenture (i) in the ca se of Notes represented by a global note, to and
through Euroclear or Clearstream for communication by them to the holde rs of interests in the Notes to be so redeemed, or (ii) in the case of definit ive Notes, to each holder of record of the Notes to
be redeemed at its registered address, at a redemption price equal to  100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, that:
(1) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the  earliest date on which the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor would be obl igated to pay such Additional Amounts were
a payment in respect of the Notes or the applicable Guarantee thereof then du e; and
(2) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation t o pay such Additional Amounts must remain in effect.
Prior to any such redemption, the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or any  Person with whom the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor has consolid ated or merged, or to whom the Issuer or the applicable
Guarantor has conveyed or transferred or leased all or substantially all o f its properties and assets (the successor Person in any such transact ion, a "Successor Person"), as the case may be, shall
provide the Trustee with an opinion of counsel to the effect that the co nditions precedent to such redemption have occurred and a certificate  signed by an authorized officer stating that the obligation
to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by taking measures that the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or the Successor Person, as th e case may be, believes are commercially reasonable.
Optional redemption
The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer at a ny time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the princi pal amount of the Notes being redeemed and
(2) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined
below), the sum of (a) the present value of the principal amount of the Notes  to be redeemed and (b) the present value of the remaining scheduled pay ments of interest thereon (not including any
portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption ) from the redemption date to the maturity date of the Note being redeeme d, in each case, discounted to the date of redemption
on an annual basis (Actual/Actual ICMA) at the Comparable Government Bond Ra te (as defined below) plus 30 basis points (0.300%), plus, in each case, acc rued and unpaid interest thereon to the
date of redemption; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Iss uer redeems any of the Notes on or after the Par Call Date (as defined belo w), such Notes are redeemable at the
Issuer's option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amo unt of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the rede mption date of such Notes being redeemed to such
date of redemption.
The principal amount of any Note remaining outstanding after a redemption i n part shall be €100,000 or a higher integral multiple of €1,000. Notwiths tanding the foregoing, installments of interest on
Notes that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling  on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest paymen t date to the registered holders of Notes as of the close of
business on the relevant record date according to the Notes and the ind enture.
"Comparable Government Bond" means, in relation to any Comparable Govern ment Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent inv estment bank selected by us (the "Quotation
Agent"), a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the p ar call date, or if such Quotation Agent in its discretion determines that  such similar bond is not in issue, such other German
government bond as such Quotation Agent may, with the advice of t hree brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining
the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
"Comparable Government Bond Rate" means the price, expressed as a pe rcentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards ), at which the gross redemption yield on the
Notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the  third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be eq ual to the gross redemption yield on such Business Day
of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market pric e of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on s uch Business Day as determined by
the Quotation Agent selected by us.
"Par Call Date" means April 23, 2027.
Notice of any redemption will be provided at least 30 days but not more t han 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeem ed (i) in the case of Notes represented by a
global note, to and through Euroclear or Clearstream for communication by them  to the holders of interests in the Notes to be so redeemed, or (ii) in the cas e of definitive Notes, by mail to each
holder of record of the Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Unle ss the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price and accrued in terest, on and after the redemption date, interest will
cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemptio n.
If less than all of the Notes are being redeemed, the Notes for redemption  will be selected as follows:
• if the Notes are held through Euroclear or Clearstream, in compliance wit h the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream; or
• if the Notes are not held through any clearing system, on a pro rata basis, by  lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
The Trustee may select for redemption the Notes and portions of the Notes in a mounts of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
Governing law
The indenture and the Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance  with, the laws of the State of New York.
Concerning our relationship with the trustee
The Issuer and the Guarantors have commercial deposits and custod ial arrangements with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, or "Deutsch e Bank," and may have borrowed money from
Deutsche Bank or its affiliates in the normal course of business. The Is suer and the Guarantors may enter into similar or other banking relations hips with Deutsche Bank or its affiliates in the future in
the normal course of business. Deutsche Bank may also act as truste e with respect to other debt securities issued by the Issuer and the Guara ntors.
Offers to purchase; open market purchases
Neither the Issuer nor any of the Guarantors is required to make any sinking fu nd payments or any offers to purchase with respect to the Notes or the Guarante es. The Issuer or the Guarantors may at
any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or oth erwise.
Certain covenants
Pursuant to the indenture, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors have cove nanted and agreed as follows.
Offer to repurchase upon change of control triggering event
The indenture provides that, upon the occurrence of a Change Of Control Tri ggering Event, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the No tes in accordance with their terms, each holder of
the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or a portio n of such holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Chang e of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if a ny, to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes o n the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date.
Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Trig gering Event occurred, or at the Issuer's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the
pending Change of Control, the Issuer will be required to send, by first c lass mail, a notice to each holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Tru stee, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of
Control Offer. Such notice will state, among other things, the purchase  date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the  date such notice is mailed, other than as may be
required by law (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed p rior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state th at the Change of Control Offer is conditioned
on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Con trol Payment Date. Holders of Notes electing to have Notes purchased pursuant to a  Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender their Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Hold er to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Truste e at the address specified in the notice, or transfer
their Notes to the Trustee by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the Trustee, prior to the close of business on the third Busine ss Day prior to the Change of Control Payment
Date.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third p arty makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in c ompliance with the requirements for such an offer
made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all corresponding Notes  properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct  or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all  or substantially all" of our assets and the assets of
our subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of cas e law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise , established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, the applicability of the requirement that the Issuer offe r to repurchase the Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyanc e or other disposition of less than all of our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another "person" (as such term s is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) may be uncertain.

There are no restrictions in the indenture limiting the amount of unsec ured Indebtedness that Amcor or any of its Subsidiaries may have outstandi ng at any time.
Consolidation, merger and sale of assets
The indenture provides that for so long as any of the Notes of any series issued thereunder or Guarantees thereunder are outstanding, neither the Iss uer nor any applicable Guarantor may consolidate
with or merge into any other Person that is not the Issuer or an applica ble Guarantor, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person that is not the Issuer or
an applicable Guarantor, unless:
(1) any Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer or such Guarant or, as the case may be, is merged or to whom the Issuer or such Guarantor, a s the case may be, has conveyed,
transferred or leased all or substantially all of its properties and asset s is a corporation, partnership or trust organized and validly existin g under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and such
Person either is the Issuer or any other applicable Guarantor or assume s by supplemental indenture the Issuer's or such Guarantor's obligations, as the case may be, on such Notes or such Guarantees,
as applicable, and under the indenture (including any obligation to  pay any Additional Amounts);
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction and treating an y Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any applicab le Guarantor as a result of such transaction as having
been incurred at the time of such transaction, no Event of Default, and no eve nt which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be
continuing;
(3) any such Person not incorporated or organized and validly existing under t he laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia,  Jersey, the Commonwealth of Australia or the
United Kingdom or any state or territory thereof shall expressly agree by a supplemental indenture,
(a) to indemnify the holder of each such Note and each beneficial owner of a n interest therein against (X) any tax, duty, assessment or other governm ental charge imposed on such holder or
beneficial owner or required to be withheld or deducted from any, payment to such holder or beneficial owner as a consequence of such consolidat ion, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease,
and (Y) any costs or expenses of the act of such consolidation, merger,  conveyance, transfer or lease, and
(b) that all payments pursuant to such Notes or such Guarantees in respect  of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Notes, as the cas e may be, shall be made without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, du ties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the
jurisdiction of organization or residency of such Person or any politi cal subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein, unless such taxes, duties, assessments or governmen tal charges are required by such jurisdiction or any such subdivision or autho rity to be withheld or deducted, in which
case such Person will pay such additional amounts ("Successor Additional  Amounts") as will result (after deduction of such taxes, duties, assess ments or governmental charges and any
additional taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges pa yable in respect of such) in the payment to each holder or beneficial owner o f a Note of such series of the amounts which
would have been received pursuant to such Notes or such Guarantees, as  the case may be, had no such withholding or deduction been required, subjec t to the same exceptions as would apply
with respect to the payment by the applicable Issuer or the applica ble Guarantors of Additional Amounts in respect of such Notes or such Guarantee s (substituting the jurisdiction of
organization of such Person for any Relevant Jurisdiction) (see "—P ayment of additional amounts"); and
(4) certain other conditions are met.
The foregoing provisions would not necessarily afford holders of the Notes protec tion in the event of highly leveraged or other transactions involving the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors that may
adversely affect holders of the Notes.
Modification and waiver
There are three types of changes the Issuer can make to the indenture and  the Notes.
Changes requiring unanimous approval
First, there are the following changes, which the Issuer cannot make to the  Notes or the indenture without the specific consent of the holder o f each Note affected thereby:
• Change the stated maturity of, or any installment of, the principal,  premium (if any) or interest on the Notes or the rate of interest on the Notes or cha nge the Issuer’s obligation to pay
Additional Amounts on the Notes, as described above under the section  entitled "—Payment of additional amounts."
• Change the place or currency of payment on the Notes.
• Impair the ability of any holder of the Notes of such series to sue for payme nt.
• Reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the m aturity of the Notes following an Event of Default.
• Reduce any amounts due on the Notes.
• Reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the consent of the h olders of which is needed to modify or amend the indenture.
• Reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the consent of the h olders of which is needed to waive compliance with certain provisio ns of the indenture or to waive certain defaults.
• Modify in a way that adversely affects holders any other aspect of th e provisions dealing with modification or waiver under the indenture.
• Modify in a way that adversely affects holders the terms and conditio ns of the applicable Guarantors' payment obligations (including with  respect to Additional Amounts) under the Notes.
• Waive a default or an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or i nterest or premium, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of accel eration of the Notes by the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, an d a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration).
• Subordinate the Notes or the Guarantees thereof to any other obligati on of the Issuer or any of the applicable Guarantors.
• Release any applicable Guarantee (other than in accordance with th e indenture).
• Change any of the provisions set forth above requiring the consent of the hol ders of the Notes.
Changes requiring majority approval
With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggrega te principal amount of the outstanding the Notes affected thereby, the Iss uer and the Trustee may modify the indenture or the
Notes for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any ma nner or eliminating any of the provisions of the indenture or of modifying in any  manner the rights of the holders of such
Notes; provided that the Issuer cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default  or any change in respect of the indenture or the Notes listed under "— Changes requiring unanimous approval" without the
consent of each holder of the Notes to such waiver or change.
Changes not requiring approval
The third type of change does not require any vote or consent by holders  of the Notes. This type is limited to clarifications and certain othe r changes as specified in the indenture that would not
adversely affect holders of the Notes in any material respect.
Further details concerning voting / consenting
When taking a vote or obtaining a consent, the Issuer will use the princ ipal amount that would be due and payable on the voting date, if the mat urity of the corresponding Notes were accelerated to
that date because of an Event of Default.
Notes will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligibl e to vote, if the Issuer has deposited or set aside in trust for you money fo r their payment or redemption, or if such Notes have been
cancelled by the Trustee or delivered to the Trustee for cancellatio n.
The Issuer will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding Notes that are entit led to vote or take other action under the indenture. In
certain limited circumstances, the Trustee will be entitled to set  a record date for action by holders of the Notes. If the Issuer or the Trustee  sets a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by
holders of the Notes, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are  holders of such Notes on the record date and must be taken within 180 days fo llowing the record date or a shorter
period that the Issuer may specify (or as the Trustee may specify, if i t set the record date). The Issuer may shorten or lengthen (but not beyond 1 80 days) this period from time to time.
Satisfaction and discharge
The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further e ffect as to all debt securities issued thereunder, when:
• either:
◦ all debt securities under the indenture that have been authenticate d and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed debt securities  under the indenture that have been replaced or paid
and applicable series of debt securities for whose payment money h as been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the applicable i ssuer or discharged from such trust, have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
◦ all debt securities under the indenture that have not been delivered t o the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable by reas on of the mailing of a notice of redemption
or otherwise, (ii) will become due and payable at their stated maturit y within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year, and, in each case the applicable issuer has
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as t rust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of such debt s ecurities, cash in US dollars, not-callable U.S.
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in amounts as will be s ufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay a nd discharge the entire indebtedness
on the applicable series of debt securities not delivered to the Truste e for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to t he maturity date or redemption date, as
the case may be;
• no default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date o f the deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit and the deposit wi ll not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the app licable issuer is a party or by which the applicable issuer is bound;
• the applicable issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payabl e by it under the indenture including all amounts due and payable to t he trustee; and
• the applicable issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the  trustee under the applicable indenture to apply the deposited mone y toward the payment of the applicable series of debt
securities at its maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be .
In addition, the applicable issuer must deliver to the Trustee an offi cers' certificate of one of its responsible officers and an opinion of coun sel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that all
conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfi ed.
Defeasance and covenant defeasance
The indenture provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors, at the Issuer’s  or the applicable Guarantor(s)'s option with respect to the Notes and t he Guarantees:
(1) will be deemed to have been discharged from their respective obliga tions in respect of the Notes (except for certain obligations to  register the transfer of or exchange the Notes, to replace stolen,
lost, destroyed or mutilated Notes upon satisfaction of certain re quirements (including, without limitation; providing such security or indem nity as the Trustee, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors
may require) and except obligations to pay all amounts due and owing to  the Trustee under the indenture), to maintain paying agents and to ho ld certain moneys in trust for payment); or
(2) need not comply with certain restrictive covenants of the indenture (inc luding those described under "—Certain covenants—Limitation on Li ens" and "—certain Covenants—Consolidation,
merger and sale of assets"),
in each case if the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors deposit in trust wit h the Trustee (i) money in an amount, (ii) U.S. Government Obligations tha t through the scheduled payment of principal and
interest in respect of the Notes in accordance with their terms will prov ide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an  amount or (iii) a combination thereof, in each case
sufficient to pay all the principal of, and any premium and interest (and a ny Additional Amounts then known) on the Notes, on the dates such paymen ts are due in accordance with the terms of the
indenture.
In the case of discharge pursuant to clause (1) above, the Issuer or the a pplicable Guarantors, as the case may be, is required to deliver to the  Trustee an opinion of counsel stating that (a) the Issuer or
the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, has received from, or there  has been published by, the IRS, a ruling or (b) since the original issue d ate of the Notes, there has been a change in the
applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effec t that the holders of the Notes will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. fed eral income tax purposes as a result of the exercise of the
option under clause (1) above and will be subject to federal income tax o n the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times a s would have been the case if such option had not been
exercised. In the case of discharge pursuant to clause (2) above, the  Issuer or the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, is required to del iver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the
holders of the Notes will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income ta x purposes as a result of the exercise of the option under clause (2) above  and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would have  been the case if such option had not been exercised.
Guarantees
Under each Guarantee, each Guarantor unconditionally guaranteed the  due and punctual payment of the principal, interest (if any), premium (if a ny) and all other amounts due on the Notes and under
the applicable indenture when the same shall become due and payable , whether at maturity, pursuant to mandatory or optional redemption or rep ayments, by acceleration or otherwise, in each case
after any applicable grace periods or notice requirements, according to t he terms of the Notes.
The obligations of each Guarantor under the Guarantees are unconditiona l, regardless of the enforceability of the Notes, and will not be discharg ed until all obligations under the Notes and the
applicable indenture are satisfied. Holders of the applicable Notes  may proceed directly against the applicable Guarantor under the applica ble Guarantee if an event of default affecting those Notes
occurs without first proceeding against the Issuer.
Fraudulent conveyance or transfer considerations
England and wales
Under English insolvency law, if a company enters administration  or goes into liquidation, then the administrator or liquidator, as appli cable, has certain powers to, among other things, apply to the
court for such order as the court sees fit (including an
order to set aside any transaction) to restore the position to what i t would have been if the company had not entered into a transaction wi th any person at an "undervalue" (as described in the UK
Insolvency Act 1986) if the transaction was entered into at a time in the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction might be at an "undervalue" if the company makes a gift
to or otherwise receives no consideration from another party or receives c onsideration the value of which (in money or money's worth) is significant ly lower than the value of the consideration given
by the company. A court generally will not intervene, however, if the compa ny entered into a transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on  its business and, at the time it did so, there
were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the com pany.
Additionally, if the liquidator or administrator can show that a "prefe rence" was given by a company at a time in the period of six months endin g with the onset of insolvency (or two years if the
preference is to a connected person), a court can make such order as it see fi ts to restore the position to what it would have been had the prefe rence not been given (including an order to set aside any
transaction). Generally, a company gives a preference to a person if it do es anything or suffers anything to be done which has the effect of putting a person who is one of the company's creditors,
sureties or guarantors in a position which, in the event of the company' s insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that person wo uld have been in had that thing not been done.
A court will only make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue  or a preference if, at the time of the relevant transaction or preference, the  company was insolvent within the meaning of
the UK Insolvency Act 1986 or became insolvent as a consequence of th e transaction or preference. Further, a court will not make an order in respect  of a preference to a person unless the company
was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to impro ve that person's position in the event of the company's insolvent liquid ation than if that thing had not been done, though this
desire is presumed where the preference is to a connected person.
In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a compan y was made at an undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting asset s beyond the reach, or otherwise prejudicing the
interests, of persons who might claim against it, then the court may make  such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would hav e been had the transaction not been entered into
(including an order to set aside any transaction) and for protecting the  interests of "victims" of the transaction. Any person who is such a "vict im" of the transaction (with the leave of the court), as
well as the administrator or liquidator of the company, may assert such a  claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made, other than relevant limitation periods, and the
company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction or in liquidat ion or administration.
Australia
Under Australian insolvency laws, a guarantee may not be enforceable a gainst a guarantor if a court were to find, in an insolvency or liquidation proc eeding, (a) that the guarantor was insolvent
(unable to pay its debts as they become due) at the time it prov ided its guarantee or was rendered insolvent by virtue of giving such guara ntee and (b) upon application of a liquidator, where the
winding up has begun within four years of the issuance of such guarantee, that  the issuance of such guarantee was an "uncommercial transaction" un der the Australian Act, which determination
would be based upon a conclusion that a reasonable person in such gua rantor's circumstances would not have issued such guarantee after c onsideration of (i) the benefits, if any, realized by such
guarantor of issuing such guarantee, (ii) the detriment to such guarantor of issuing such guarantee, (iii) the respective benefits realized by othe r parties to the transaction, and (iv) any other fact that a
reasonable person would consider relevant in connection with making such de termination.
United States
Under United States bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of sta te fraudulent transfer laws, a guarantee can be voided, or claims under a  guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of that
guarantor if, among other things, the guarantor, at the time it incurred the ind ebtedness evidenced by its guarantee:
• intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor or receive d less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the inc urrence of the guarantee;
• was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;
• was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor's  remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or
• intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature.
In addition, any payment by that guarantor under a guarantee could be voide d and required to be returned to the guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the c reditors of the guarantor.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary dep ending upon the governing law. Generally, a guarantor would be considered in solvent if:
• the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was great er than the fair saleable value of all of its assets;
• the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the a mount that would be required, to pay its probable liability on its exis ting debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or
• it could not pay its debts as they become due.
Jersey
Under Article 17 of the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended  (the "Jersey Bankruptcy Law") and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law,  the court may, on the application of the
Viscount of Jersey (in the case of a company whose property has been dec lared "en désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding up , a procedure which is instigated by shareholders not
creditors), set aside a guarantee entered into by a company with any pers on at an undervalue. There is a five year look back period from the date of comm encement of the winding up or declaration of
"désastre" during which guarantees are susceptible to examination  pursuant to this rule. If the court determines that the transaction was  a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it i s for the Viscount of Jersey or liquidator to demonstrate that the
Jersey company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction wa s a connected person or associate of the company, in which case the re is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person
must demonstrate the Jersey company was not insolvent when it entered the transaction in such proceedings.
Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jerse y Companies Law, the court may, on the application of the Viscount  of Jersey (in the case of a company whose property
has been declared "en désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors ' winding up), set aside a preference (including a guarantee) given by the  company to any person. There is a 12 month look
back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of " désastre" during which guarantees are susceptible to examination  pursuant to this rule.
A guarantee will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a  creditor of the Jersey company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company's d ebts or liabilities) in a better position (in the
event of the company going into an insolvent winding up) than such credi tor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transac tion not been entered into. If the court determines that
the guarantee constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference ha d not been given. However, for the court to do so,
it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Jersey com pany was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the Viscount of Jersey or
liquidator to demonstrate that the Jersey company was insolvent at t he relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire t o produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the
guarantee was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption t hat the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential  effect and the connected person must demonstrate in
such proceedings that the company was not influenced by such a desi re.
In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are ce rtain principles of Jersey customary law (for example, a Pauline action ) under which dispositions of assets with the intention
of defeating creditors' claims may be set aside.

SECTION 3 Eligibility and Participation 3.1 Eligibility Each Plan Year, the Committee will determin e those Employees who are Eligible Employees. Eligible Employee generally means an Employee  of an Employer whose annualized base compensation and bonus is expected to exceed the lim itations of Section 414(q) of the Code ($105,000, as adjusted from time to time) in the cu rrent year and who is considered part of key management personnel. An Employee may be an Eligi ble Employee to make Employee Contributions, to receive Employer Make-Up Matching Co ntributions, to receive Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions, to receive Employer Special Co ntributions, or to receive Employer 10% Target Contributions, as the Committee determines. 3.2 Participation An Eligible Employee who is selected as eligible to make Employee Contributions to the Plan shall commence participation in the Plan as of the later of the Eligible Employee’s designation as an Eligible Employee or the date an Eligible Employee elects to make Employee Contributions. An Eli gible Employee may elect to make Employee Contributions to the Plan by filing an election with the Committee in accordance with Section 4. Once an Eligible Employee makes an election, the election remains in effect in accordance with Section 4. An Eligible Employee who is selected to receive Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions, Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions, Employer Special Co ntributions, and/or Employer 10% Target Contributions shall commence participation in the Plan as of the Eligible Employee’s designation as an Eligible Employee. The fact that a Participant is eligible to make Employee Contributions or to receive Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions, Em ployer Make-Up Pension Contributions, Employer Special Contributions, and/or Employer 10%  Target Contributions (or a certain level of Employer Contributions) in one Plan Year does notguarantee the Participant the right to make or receive such Employee Contributions or Employer Contributions (or level of Employer Contributions) in any other Plan Year. The Committee may terminate or suspend the participation of any Eligible Employee at any time. However, except as provided in su bsections 5.1 and 5.2, a Participant’s suspension or termination from the Plan shall not reduce the Account balances of a Participant. An Eligible Employee shall cease to be a Participant when the Eligible Employee’s employment is terminated with all Employers and their Affiliates and the Eligib le Employee’s vested Account balance is distributed to the Eligible Employee or the Eligible Employ ee’s Beneficiaries. -7-

An Eligible Employee also may have elected to defer into the Plan, by September 30, 2000, a stock appre ciation rights payment from the LTIP received as a result of a change in control. Any such long-ter m incentive or stock appreciation rights contributions are part of a Participant’s Grandfathered Account. 4.2 Salary Deferral Contributions The Plan permits Salary Deferral Contributions of between 1% and 50% of an Eligible Employee’s Compensation. A newly designated Eligible Employee who i s selected as eligible to make Employee Contributions to the Plan may elect to make Salary Deferral Contributions by making an election in accordance with the Committee’s procedures within 30 day s of such eligibility, which election shall be effective on a prospective basis beginning with the payroll period that occurs as soon as administratively feasible following completion of the election. All other Eligible Employees may elect Salary Deferral Contributions by making an election in accordance with the Committee’s procedures by the December 15th prior to the beginning of a Plan Year , which election shall be effective beginning the following January 1. All elections are effective for one Plan Year and are irrevocable for a Plan Year once made. However, if a Participant receives a hardship distribution under the Savings Plan, such Participant’s Salary Deferral Contribution election shall automatically be cancelled for the remainder of the calendar year in which the hardship distribution is received. Such Participant’s Salary Deferral Contributions shall be suspendedautomatically for a period of six months following receipt of the hardship distribution a nd such Participant may not resume making Salary Deferral Contributions until the January 1 fo llowing the expiration of the six-month suspension period. 4.3 Bonus Contributions Th e Plan permits Bonus Contributions of between 1% and 100% of an Eligible Employee’s bonus paid from  an Employer’s U.S. payroll. A newly designated Eligible Employee who is selected as eligible to make Employee Contributions to the Plan may elect to make Bonus Contributions by making an el ection in accordance with the Committee’s procedures within 30 days of such eligibility, which election shall be effective on a prospective basis beginning with the payroll period that occurs as soon as administratively feasible following completion of the election. All other Eligible Employees may elect Bonus Contributions by making an election in accordance with the Committee’s procedures by  December 15th, which election shall be effective for bonuses earned during any Employer’s fiscal year that ends after such date, provided that such election is made no later than six months prior to the end of the service period to which it relates. If an Eligible Employee is -8-
 
awarded a bonus or incentive pay or an award under the Amcor PET Packaging Management Incentive Pl an, the Eligible Employee may elect to defer all or a portion of such award, provided that such election is made in the manner prescribed by the Committee. Such election will be irrevocable once made. Beginning on the January 1, 2005, a Participant’s election to defer all or a portion of a performa nce-based bonus attributable to services performed over a period of twelve months or more must b e made no later than six months prior to the end of such 12-month period. 4.4 Employer Make-Up  Matching Contributions Effective as of January 1, 2005, the Employer may, in its sole discretion, make a contribution each Plan Year to Eligible Employees in the amount necessary to provide suc h Participants with the employer matching contributions they will not receive under the Savings Plan due to: (i) the limitation of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (ii) the limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (iii) the fact that a Participant’s Employee Contributions into this Plan are not included as compensation for purposes of determining contributions under the Savings Plan (“Emplo yer Make-Up Matching Contributions”). However, to receive Employer Make- Up Matching Contribu tions in a Plan Year, an Eligible Employee must contribute the maximum amount allowable by law o r the Employer under the Savings Plan. 4.5 Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions Effectiv e as of January 1, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2012, the Employer may, in its sole discretion, mak e a contribution each Plan Year to Eligible Employees in the amount necessary to provide such Participants with the approximate benefits they will not receive under the Pension Plan due to: (i) the limitations of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (ii) the limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (iii) the fact that a Participant’s Employee Contributions into this Plan are not included as compensationfor purposes of benefit accruals under the Pension Plan (“Employer Make-Up Pension Contribut ions”). The Employer may, in its sole discretion, choose not to make such a contribution in any Plan  Year for some or all Participants. The Employer may, in its sole discretion, chose to make a contribution in any Plan Year for some or all Participants of less than the full amount necessary to make up the Pension Plan benefits due to items (i) through (iii) above. The following provisions and a ssumptions shall govern the determination of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contribution s: (a) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions each Plan Year, the Employer shall assume that the Participant will terminate employment and  begin receiving benefits from the Pension Plan at the later of age 60 or the Participant’s attainment of five years of service (as defined in the Pension Plan), which benefits shall be assumed to be reduced for early commencement unless the Participant has attained age 65 and completed 5 years of service. If a Participant terminates employment after age 55 and completion of 5 years of service but prior to age 60, the Participant will receive a lesser amount of Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions than if the Participant had remained employed until age 60. If a Participant who is eligible for Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions remains employed by -9-
 
an Employer until age 60 and completion of 5 years of service, the Participant will continue to receive Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions past such date to account for the Participant’s service after such date. (b) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contribution each Plan Year, the Employer will base contributions on Compensation, the GAM  94 mortality table, and assumed Compensation increases of inflation plus 1.5%, provided that all actuarial assumptions may vary as the Committee determines advisable. The Employer will hypoth etically assume that prior Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions on behalf of such Participant will increase at an earnings rate specified by the Committee, which as of January 1, 2005 equals the average of the 10-year Treasury US government securities plus 2%, notwithstanding the fact that the Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions will be invested in the investment funds sel ected by the Participant in accordance with subsection 6.2 of the Plan. (c) Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions for eligible Participants will be fully funded by the Employer at the later of: (i) the Participant’s attainment of age 60, or (ii) the Participant’s completion of five years of service (as defined under the Pension Plan). However, if a Participant continues employment after age 6 0, the Committee shall determine the procedures for future funding of such Participant’s benefit. 4.6 Employer Special Contributions The Employer may, in its sole discretion, make an additional Employer Special Contribution in any Plan Year to Eligible Employees in any amount determined by the Com mittee. 4.7 Employer 10% Target Contributions Effective as of January 1, 2008, the Employer m ay, in its sole discretion, make a contribution each Plan Year to Eligible Employees to provide such Participant with a supplemental retirement savings contribution (“Employer 10% TargetContribution”). A Participant’s Employer 10% Target Contribution for the Plan Year shall equal 1 0% of the sum of the Participant’s Compensation for the Plan Year, reduced by all of the following that are paid or accrued (or deemed paid or accrued as described below) for the same Plan Year: (a) Savings Plan Retirement Savings Contributions; (b) Savings Plan New Employer Matching Contributio ns; (c) Savings Plan Employer Discretionary Matching Contributions; and (d) the Employ er portion of the Social Security tax on the Eligible Employee's Compensation for the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (“OASDI”) -10-
 
program, which amount is currently 6.2% of the Eligible Employee's Compensation. For purposes of items (b) and (c), the Participant shall be deemed to have made the maximum employee contribution un der the Savings Plan, and have received the maximum matching contribution available under the Sav ings Plan based upon such deemed employee contribution, regardless of the Participant’s actual con tribution rate. -11-
 
SECTION 5 Accounting and Vesting 5.1 Vesting Except as provided in subsection 5.2, a Particip ant will fully vest in his Plan Accounts as follows: (a) A Participant will be fully vested at all times in the Participant’s own Employee Contributions held in the Participant’s Accounts.

5.2 Termination for Cause or Violation of Non-Compete Restrictions Notwithstanding any provisions in  the Plan to the contrary, any Participant terminated for cause shall forfeit 100% of the Participant’s Accounts.

(c) The determination of whether a Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency, and the amount of payment to which the Participant is entitled, shall be determined by the Committee based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. If a Participant receives a hardship distribution from the Plan, then the Participant’s Employee Contributions shall be suspended for the remainder of the calendar year in which such distribution occurred. -18-
 
7.5 Payments After Death If a Participant dies before receiving the entire balance of the Participant’s Accounts, the remaining balance in the Participant’s Accounts shall become 100% vested and shall be paid to the Participant’s Beneficiaries designated in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee. Payment of the remaining balance of the Participant’s Accounts shall be made in a s ingle lump sum within 90 days following the date on which the Committee is notified of the Participant’s death. 7.6 Payments Upon Disability Notwithstanding a Participant’s elections and any provisio n of the Plan to the contrary, all Accounts that have not yet commenced distribution shall automatically be distributed to a Participant as soon as administratively practicable following the Participant’s Disability as defined under subsection 2.10. Upon Disability, a Participant will receive distribution of the Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts either in: (i) a lump sum; or (ii) substantially equal annual installments payable at the Participant’s election over a two-year to ten-year period specified by the Participant. If a Participant wishes to make changes to any Disability distribution election form with respect to the Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts, such changes must comply with the rules contained in subsection 7.1. Upon a Participant’s Disability, the Participant’s 409A Accounts shall be distributed to the Participant in accordance with the forms of payment elected on the Participant’s distribution election form applicable to each year of contributions. If a Participant wishes to make changes to any Disability distribution election form with respect to the Employee Contributions in the Participant’s 409A Accounts, such changes must comply with the rules contain ed in subsection 7.2. 7.7 Special Distribution Rules for 409A Accounts If the Company or Affiliate’ s deduction for payment of all or any portion of to a Participant’s 409A Accounts would be limited oreliminated by the application of Section 162(m) of the Code, then the Plan will defer payment of such Participant’s 409A Accounts either (i) to a date in the first year in which the Company or the Com mittee reasonably anticipates that such payment will not result in a deduction limitation under Section 162(m) or (ii) to the year in which the Participant’s separation from employment occurs. If payment of all or any portion of the Participant’s 409A Accounts would violate securities or other applicable laws, or would violate loan covenants or other contractual terms to which the Company or an Affiliate is a party and such violation would result in material harm to the Company or an Affiliate, then payment of the Participant’s 409A Accounts will be made in the first calendar year: (i) in which the Company or Committee reasonably anticipates that the payment would not violate loan or other similar contractual terms and would not result in material harm to the Company or an Affiliate, and (ii) in which the payment would not result in a violation of securities or other applicable laws. Plan payments intended to pay employment taxes, or made as a result of income inclusion of an amount of a Participant’s -19-
 
benefit as a result of a failure to satisfy Section 409A of the Code, shall be permitted at the Company or Committee’s discretion at any time to the extent provided in Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1, Q&A-15, and any applicable subsequent gu idance. “Employment taxes” shall include the Federal Income Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed  under Sections 3101 and 3121(v)(2) of the Code on compensation deferred under the  Plan (the “FICA Amount”), the income tax imposed under Section 3401 of the Code on the FICA Am ount, and any amounts utilized to pay the additional income tax under Section 3401 of the Code a ttributable to the pyramiding Section 3401 wages and taxes. If any applicable payment period begins in one Plan Year and ends in the following Plan Year, the Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary (as the case may be) shall not have the right to designate the year of the payment. 7.8 Designation of Beneficiary A Participant may, by completing a Beneficiary designation form in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee, designate one or more primary and contingent Beneficiaries (which may include a trust or an estate) to receive the Participant’s Account balance following the Participant’s death and may designate the proportions in which such Beneficiaries receive payments. A Participant’s Beneficiary designation shall apply to all of his Accounts under the Plan. A Participant may change such designations from time to time, and the last designation filed prior to the Participant’s death shall control. If no Beneficiary designation form was filed by the Participant prior to the Participant’s death, the Participant’s remaining Account balance will be paid to the Participant’s estate. 7.9 Facility of Payment Any amounts payable under the Plan to a Participant or Beneficiary who is under a legal disability or who, in the judgment of the Committee, is unable to manage such person’saffairs, may be paid to the legal representative of such person or may be applied for the benefit of such person in any manner the Committee shall select. 7.10 Unclaimed Benefits If a Participant or Beneficiary’s whereabouts are unknown to the Employer, and if the Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary fails to claim the Participant’s benefits within two years following termination of the Participant’s employment, the Committee may elect to make payment of the Participant or Beneficiary’s vested benefits as if they had died. If the Employer is unable to locate the Participant or any Beneficiary within three years following the Participant’s employment termination, the Participant and all of the Participant’s designated Beneficiaries shall forfeit all benefits irrevocably. -20-
 
SECTION 8 Nature of Interest of Participant Participation in this Plan will not create, in favor of any Participant, any right or lien in or against any of the assets of any Employer, and a Participant’s Account balances shall remain an unrestricted asset of the Participant’s Employer. A Participant’s rights to benefits payable under the Plan are not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, or encumbrance. All payments hereunder shall be paid in cash from the general funds of the applicable Employer and no special or separate fund shall be established and no other segregation of assets shall be made to assure the payment of benefits hereunder. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be con strued to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship, between any Employer and a Participant or any other person, and each Employer’s promise to pay benefits hereunder shall at all times remain unfunded as to the Participant. -21-
