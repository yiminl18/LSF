ss to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to amuch lesser extent, from al
liance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us. The majority of ourrevenues come from the manufacture and sale of b
iopharmaceutical products. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June2, 1942.
We believe that our medic
ines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but alsofrom a reduction in o
ther healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. Wecontinue to actively engage in d
ialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treatdisease and improve ou
tcomes. We continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements andcontracting methods with
 payers, to maximize patient access and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling ourcompany’s purpose of innovating to b
ring therapies to patients that extend and significantly improve their lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for thepatients we serve and
 for our shareholders.We are committed to ca
pitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as throughvarious forms of business 
development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions,mergers and acquisitions. 
We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhanceshareholder value by pursuing a d
isciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities.Our significant recent b
usiness development activities include:•
On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS, to ICU Medical for up to approximately $900 million , composed of cash and contingent cash cons
ideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. HIS, which was acquired as part of the Hospiraacquisition in September 2
015, includes IV pumps, solutions and devices.•
On December 22, 2016, for $1,045 million we acquired the develo pment and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectivesbusiness, primarily outside the
 U.S., which includes the newly approved EU drug Zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), the marketed agentsMerrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem
) and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets aztreonam-avibactam and ceftarolinefosamil-avibactam.
•
On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for approximately $14.3 billion in cash ( $13.9 billion , net of cash ac quired). Medivation is abiopharmaceutical company 
focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology.•

tical company focused on novel small-molecule therapeutics derived from its boron chemistry platform.•
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars,for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). For a further discussion of our st

and the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy and Outlook — Our Strategy — Our Business Development Initiativessection in our 
2017 Financial Report. Our businesses are heavil
y regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. TheFDA regulates the safety and efficac
y of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and productlabeling. Simi
lar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA regulates thescientific evaluat
ion, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of drugs for the EU and the EuropeanEconomic Area countries. I
n Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviewsand pharmaceutical saf
ety. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e.,similar to the authority of the F
DA or EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. For additionalinformation, see the

TABLE OF CONTENTSCOMMERCIAL OPERATIONS
We manage our commercial o
perations through two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). The IH and EH operating segments 
are each led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects fornew investigational produ
cts and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof-of-concept. Each business has a geographicfootprint across developed and emerg
ing markets.Some additional informat
ion about our business segments as of the date of the filing of this 2017 Form 10-K follows:
 
IH focuses on developin
g and commercializing novel, value-creatingmedicines and vaccines tha
t significantly improve patients’ lives, as well asproducts for consumer healthcare.
Key therapeutic areas
 include internal medicine, vaccines, oncology,inflammation & immunology, rare
 disease and consumer healthcare. EH includes legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose marketexclusivity in both developed
 and emerging markets, branded generics,generic sterile injectable prod
ucts, biosimilars, select branded productsincluding anti-infectives and,
 through February 2, 2017, HIS. EH alsoincludes an R&D organization, 
as well as our contract manufacturingbusiness.
We expect that th
e IH biopharmaceutical portfolio of innovative, largelypatent-protected
, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained byongoing investments to develop prom
ising assets and targeted businessdevelopment in areas of focus to help ensu
re a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in a
reas of unmet medical need. Theassets managed by 
IH are science-driven, highly differentiated andgenerally require a high-level 
of engagement with healthcare providers andconsumers.
 
EH is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providingpatients around t
he world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-valuetreatments. EH leverages
 our biologic development, regulatory andmanufacturing expertise
 to seek to advance its biosimilar developmentportfolio. Additionally, EH leverag
es capabilities in formulation developmentand manufacturing 
expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectablesportfolio. EH may also engage 
in targeted business development to furtherenable its commercial strategies.
IH will have continued focus 
on R&D productivity and pipeline strength whilemaximizing the value of our
 recently launched brands and in-line portfolio.Our acquisitions of Anacor
 and Medivation expanded our pipeline in thehigh priority therapeutic 
areas of inflammation and immunology andoncology.
 
For EH, we continue to invest in growth drivers and manage the portfolio toextract additional value while s
eeking opportunities for operatingefficiencies. This strategy inclu
des active management of our portfolio;maximizing growth of core pro
duct segments; acquisitions to strengthencore areas of our portfolio further, su
ch as our recent acquisition ofAstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-inf
ectives business; and divestitures toincrease focus on our core strengths. In 
line with this strategy, on February3, 2017, we complet
ed the sale of Pfizer’s global infusion systems netassets, representing the infusion 
systems net assets that we acquired aspart of the Hospira transaction, 
HIS, to ICU Medical.Leading brands include: 
- 
Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 - 
Xeljanz - 
Eliquis - 
Lyrica  (U.S., Japan and c ertain other markets) - 
Enbrel (outside the U.S. and Canada) -

Viagra lost exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2017. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada, which were reported in IH throughDecember 2017, will be reported in EH (which reported all other Viagra revenues excluding the U.S. and Canada through 2017). Therefore, total Viagra worldwide revenues
will be reported in EH from 2018 forward.

We are party to collaboration and/o
r co-promotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products, including Eliquis , Xtandi and Bavencio . Eliquis 
has been jointly developed and i s being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costsdepending on the study. Profits and losse
s are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales. 
We have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to us at cost plusa percentage of the net sales to end-customers 
in these markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Ant icoagulant market; the agents in this class were developedas alternative treatment options to 
warfarin in appropriate patients.Xtandi 
is being developed an d commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to U.S.net sales of 
Xtandi . Subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributa ble to the U.S. market. Inaddition, Pfizer and Astel
las share certain development and other collaboration expenses, and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of internationalXtandi 
net sales (recorded in Other (Income)/Deductions –– Net ). Xtandi is an androgen receptor inhibito r that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptorsignaling pathway within tumor c
ells.Bavencio 
is being developed an d commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Both companies jointly fund all development and commercialization costs,and split equally any pro

Our goal is to discover, deve
lop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs.
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy
Our R&D priorities include delivering a pip
eline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and commercial potential, advancing ourcapabilities that can positio
n Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation andproductivity. To that end, our research and de
velopment primarily focuses on:•
Biosimilars;•
Inflammation and Immunology;•
Metabolic Disease and Cardiovascular Risks;•
Oncology;•
Rare Diseases; and•
Vaccines.In January 2018, we announced our decision to end 
internal neuroscience discovery and early development efforts and re-allocate funding to other areas wherewe have stronger scientif
ic leadership. We plan to create a dedicated neuroscience venture fund to support continued efforts to advance the field. Thedevelopment of tanezumab and potential treatments fo
r rare neuromuscular disorders is not impacted by this decision.While a significant portion of
 R&D is done internally, we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologiesdeveloped by third parties to in
corporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations,alliances and licen
se agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. We also enter into agreementspursuant to which a third party agree
s to fund a portion of the development costs of one of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potentialmilestone payments, revenue shar
ing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties. For additional information on these collaborations, agreements andinvestments, see the 
Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy and Outlook — Our Strategy — Description of Research and DevelopmentOperations 
section in our 2017 Financial Report.Our R&D Operations
We conduct R&D internally and 
also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperationwith other pharmaceutical f
irms. We continue to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overallproductivity in R&D to achieve a
 sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time.Our R&D spending is conduct
ed through a number of matrix organizations. Research Units within our Worldwide Research and Development (WRD)organization are generally 
responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our IH business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept).Our science-based and other platform
-services organizations, where a significant portion of our R&D spending occurs, provide end-to-end scientific and technicalexpertise and other services to the 
various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our WRD organization), such asPharmaceutical Sciences, Medicinal Chemistry
, Regulatory and Drug Safety, and non-science-based functions, such as Facilities, Business Technology andFinance. Our R&D organizat
ion within the EH business supports the large base of EH products and is expected to develop potential new sterile injectable drugsand therapeutic solutions, as we
ll as biosimilars. Our Global Product Development organization is a unified center for late-stage development for our innovativeproducts and is gen
erally responsible for the operational execution of clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovativeportfolios.

se R&D matrix organizations and additional information on our R&D operations, see the Overview of Our Performanc e, OperatingEnvironment, Strategy and Outlook 
— Our Strategy — Description of Research and Development Operations and Costs and Expenses — Research andDevelopment (R&D) Expenses 
sections in our 2017 Financial Report. Our R&D Pipeline and Competition
Innovation is critica
l to the success of our company, and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to thePharmaceutical Benchmar
king Forum, out of 17 compounds entering preclinical development, on average, only one is approved by a regulatory authority in amajor market (U.S., the E
U or Japan). The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. Drugcandidates can fail at any stage of the proce
ss, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development.As of 
January 30, 2018 , we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:

Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatoryapproval, new drug candidates enter
ing clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing newproducts, our R&D efforts seek to add 
value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential newindications for them.
Information concerning severa
l of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—
Product Developments — Biopharmaceutical section in our 2017 Financial Report, which is incorpora ted by reference.Our competitors also devote substant
ial funds and resources to R&D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potentialdrug candidates. The extent to which our co
mpetitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potentialsales of products in development, a
s well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&D expensesand make a regular practice of cha
llenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors—

TABLE OF CONTENTSINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We have significant operat
ions outside the U.S. Operations in developed and emerging markets are managed through our two business segments: IH and EH.Emerging markets are an impo
rtant component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and risingeconomic power of the fastest-gro
wing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets.We sell our products in o
ver 125 countries. Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $26.5 billion accounted for 50% of our total revenues in 2017 . By total revenues, Japan and China are our two 
largest national markets outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the table captioned Geographic Information 
in the Notes to Consolida ted Financial Statements— Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Infor mation in our 2017 Financial Report, and the table captioned 
Revenues by Segment and Geography in our 2017 Financial Report. Those table s are incorporated by reference.
Our international operations are 
subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries, including, among otherthings, currency fluctuation
s, capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Affecting Internation

TABLE OF CONTENTSMARKETING
In our global biopharmaceutica
l businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain theapproved uses, benefits and risks of ou
r products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; ManagedCare Organizations that prov
ide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, Pharmacy Benefit Managers and health plans; andemployers and government agencies 
who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. throughdirect-to-consumer advert
ising that seeks to communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningfulconversations with thei
r doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, importantpublic health issues, and our pat
ient assistance programs.Our prescription pharmace
utical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies andpharmacies, and, in t
he case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wholesalers andindividual provider offices. We se
ek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and MCO formularies, which are lists of approved medicines availableto members of the MCOs. MCOs use 
various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formularypositions. We also wo
rk with MCOs to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines.In 
2017 , our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 38% of our total reven ues (and approximately 79% of our total U.S. revenues).

Our global Consumer Healthcar
e business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products, and occasionally uses distributors andagents, principally in smaller markets
. The advertising and promotions for our Consumer Healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers throughtelevision, print, digital and
 other media advertising, as well as through in-store promotion. Consumer Healthcare products are sold through a wide variety ofchannels, including distributors
, pharmacies, retail chains and grocery and convenience stores. Our Consumer Healthcare business generates a significantportion of its sales from se
veral large customers, the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the Consumer Healthcare business.PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Our products are sold around the wor
ld under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of materialimportance to Pfizer. Trademar
k protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered.Registrations generally are f
or fixed, but renewable, terms.We own or license a number of 
U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations,product manufacturing processes and 
intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.Patents for individual produ
cts extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countrieswhere patent protection is obtained. The actua
l protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, thescope of its coverage and the availab
ility of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries tocompensate for a regulatory delay 
in approval of the product. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Intellectual Propertybelow.
In various markets, a period of regu
latory exclusivity may be provided to certain therapeutics upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but,in general, the perio
d of regulatory exclusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the therapeutic.In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of mater
ial importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current product sales,and considering the vigorous co
mpetition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as awhole, together with t
he year in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity period and/orthe granted patent term extension), are those for the med
icines set forth in the table below. Unless otherwise indicated, the years set forth in the table belowpertain to the basic product patent expirat
ion for the respective products. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivityperiods are not reflected in the exp
iration dates listed in the table below, unless they have been granted by the issuing authority. In some instances, there arelater-expiring patents re
lating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use of the drug in the treatment ofparticular diseases or 
conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable, biosimilar competition after theexpiration of the basic patent.

In addition to the basic product patent covering Viagra , which expired in 2012, Viagra is covered by a U.S. method-of-treatment patent which, including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period associated with 
Revatio (which has the same active ingredient as Viagra ), expires in 2020. As a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. launched a generic version of 
Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017. The corresponding method-of-treatment patent covering Viagra in Japan expired in May 2014.

 Besponsa Japan expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity. (10) 
 Bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. A number of our current products have exper
ienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years. Foradditional information, 
including a description of certain of our expired co-promotion agreements, and a further discussion of our products experiencing, orexpected to experience in 
2018 , patent expirations or loss of regu latory exclusivity in the U.S., Europe or Japan, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Out
look — Our Operating Environment — Industry-Specific Challenges — Intellectual Property Rights andCollaboration/Licensing Rights 
section in our 2017 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. Companies have filed appl
ications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents; these includecandidates that would compete w
ith, among other products, Xeljanz and Xtandi . We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review,post-grant review, re-exam
ination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreigncounterparts relating to our inte
llectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements— 
Note 17A1. Commitments a nd Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Patent Litigation in our 2017 Financial Report. The expiration of a basic product patent or 
loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from genericproducts against the original
ly patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time. In some cases,however, we can continue to obtain co
mmercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on processes andintermediates for the economica
l manufacture of the active ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; or conversion ofthe active ingredient 
to OTC products.Biotechnology Products
Our biotechnology pro
ducts, including BeneFIX , ReFacto , Xyntha , Bavencio , Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), may face in 
the future, or already face, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such biosimilars wouldreference biotechnology products appro
ved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growthhormone that referenced our biotechnology produ
ct, Genotropin , which was approved un der the FFDCA.Biosimilars a
re versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and tohave no clinically meaningful diff
erences. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines. Abbreviated legalpathways for the approval of bios
imilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage in 2010 of the ACA, a framework for such approval exists inthe U.S.
In Europe, the European Commiss
ion has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specificguidelines for biosimilar approvals issue
d over the past few years.As part of our business strategy, 
we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to developbiosimilar medicines. See 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Biotechnology Products below. We may face litigation 
with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products. Likewise, as we develop and manufacturebiosimilars and see
k to launch products, patents may be asserted against us.International
One of the main limitations on ou
r operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Under
international and U.S. free trade agreements in recent years, global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving. For additional information, seeGovernment Regulation 
and Price Constraints — Intellectual Property below. COMPETITION
Our businesses are conducted in 
intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition inthe form of branded or generic drugs or bio
similars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease ofuse, and cost effectiveness. Though the means of compet
ition vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is acritical factor for success in all o
f our principal businesses.Our competitors include o
ther worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, genericand biosimilar drug manufa
cturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treatdiseases or indications similar to t
hose treated by our major products.This competition affects our co
re product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medicalneeds and provide 
therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our businessdevelopment transactions, both designed to 
result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue toinvest in further understanding the va
lue of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health andwell-being of patients by 
striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated topatients, physicians and globa
l health authorities. We also seek to continuallyPfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSenhance the organizational effectivene
ss of all of our biopharmaceutical functions, including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately andethically launch and promote ou
r products to our customers.Operating conditions have become mo
re challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue totake measures to evaluate, adapt and improve ou
r organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we havetaken an industry-leading ro
le in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising; interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals;and medical education grants. We a
lso continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamentalhealth system change through support for better hea
lthcare solutions.Our vaccines business ma
y face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of alternative 13-valent or add
itional valent next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents, which may adverselyaffect our future results.
Our generics and biosimilars busin
esses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. Globally,Pfizer sells generic versions of Pfizer’s,
 as well as certain competitors’, solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products, as well as biosimilars. Weseek to maximize the op
portunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars, as a “first-to-market”position provides customers 
a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitabilityuntil other generic or 
biosimilar competitors enter the market.Our Consumer Healthcare bus
iness faces competition from OTC business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, andretailers who carry the
ir own private label brands. Our competitive position is affected by several factors, including the amount and effectiveness of our and ourcompetitors’ promotiona
l resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors’ introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosageforms, or other forms of innovation; and p
ricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription to OTC switches).Managed Care Organizations
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. ha
s been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 291 million people inthe U.S. now have some form of health 
insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see Government Regulation and PriceConstraints 
— In the United States below), the marketing of presc ription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in theU.S. continues to grow in
 importance.The influence of MCOs has inc
reased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, thoseorganizations have been consol
idating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance toPfizer.
The growth of MCOs has increased p
ressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcareexpenditures. MCOs typically ne
gotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to members ofthe MCOs), clinica
l protocols (requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or moregeneric products before permitt
ing access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market shareof prescription drugs. In addit
ion, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tierstatus, MCOs transfer a portion of the co
st of the medicine to the patient, resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especially for chronictreatments. This financial d
isincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. MCOs also useadditional measures such 
as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing, copay accumulator programs and value-based pricing/contracting toimprove their cost contain
ment efforts. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.Due to their generally lower c
ost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered byformularies can vary con
siderably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particularmedical problems. MCOs are curre
ntly evaluating the appropriate placement of biosimilars on their formularies.Exclusion of a product from a for
mulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently,pharmaceutical companies 
compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use,or fewer side effects,
 are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. We havebeen generally, altho
ugh not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products arebeing placed on the higher tiers or 
in a non-preferred status.Pfizer Inc.
2017 Form 10-K 7 
TABLE OF CONTENTSMCOs also emphasize pr
imary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to managecosts. Hospitalizat
ion and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain drugs can reduce the needfor hospitalization, profes
sional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases.The ACA has accelerated
 payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality whilereducing costs, which c
reates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts tomodify or repeal all or 
certain provisions of the ACA, although the current likelihood of repeal of the ACA appears low given the failure of the Senate’s multipleattempts to repeal various comb
inations of ACA provisions. We are monitoring any such actions to see if any changes to the ACA will be enacted that wouldimpact our business.
Generic Products
One of the biggest competitive chal
lenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patentprotection for a product, especial
ly a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Severalcompetitors make a regular pra
ctice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses,as well as without co
sts of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts genericsfrom costly and time-consu
ming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data ofthe innovator product. Generic compet
itors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our product after the expirationor loss of our patent and often charge much les
s.In addition, our patent-protected products can face 
competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.As noted above, MCOs that focus prima
rily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage theuse of generics as alt
ernatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in somecases require, pharmacist
s to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically andtherapeutically equiva
lent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials essential to our 
businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials areavailable from multiple sources. 
In 2017 , we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with theassociated suppliers. Supp
lier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials. Nosignificant impact to our ope
rations is anticipated in 2018.GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
Pharmaceutical companie
s are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain laws and regulationsthat govern Pfizer’s busin
ess are discussed below.General 
. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, includingthose governing the manufacture and marketing of ou
r products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmentalbodies. For additional infor
mation on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 17A. Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedin
gs in our 2017 Financial Report. Criminal charges, s ubstantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and product recalls orseizures, delays in product
 approvals, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from such proceedings andactions.
In the United States
Drug Regulation 
. In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulations by the FDA, including regulations thatgovern the testing, manufacturing, safety, eff
icacy, labeling and storage of our products, record keeping, advertising and promotion. Our products are alsosubject to post-market
 surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Act and itsimplementing regulations with res
pect to biologics. The FDA also regulates our Consumer Healthcare products.Other U.S. federal agencies, in
cluding the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has the authority to regulate theadvertising of consumer health
care products, including OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC.Before a new biopharmaceutica
l product may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic. The steps requiredbefore the FDA will approve
 an NDA or BLA generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor;sponsor submission of the appl
ication to the FDA for review; the FDA’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA’s inspectionof the facilities where the p
roduct will be manufactured.Before a generic dru
g may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an ANDA. The ANDA review process typically does not require new preclinical andclinical studie
s, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the NDA process.The ANDA process, howeve
r, does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to thepreviously approved referenced b
rand drug, submission of an application to the FDA for review, and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the product willbe manufactured.
As a condition of product approval, the F
DA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical studies, known as Phase 4 studies, and surveillanceprograms to monitor the effect of the approved product. The F
DA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market studies andprograms. Any modifications 
to a drug or biologic, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require thesubmission and approval of a ne
w or supplemental NDA or BLA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we develop additional dataor conduct additional 
preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation bythe FDA, including record
keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to cGMPs, which regulate allaspects of the manufacturing process. 
We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics,including, but not lim
ited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governingthe manufacture and marketing of our products ma
y subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delaysin product approvals, inju
nctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
Biosimilar Regulation. The ACA created a fr amework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years ofexclusivity for the innovator
 biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four yearsafter the approval of the reference, innovator b
iologic.The FDA is responsible fo
r implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars. Through those approvals and the issuance of draft and finalguidance, the FDA has begun to address open question
s about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of data from a non-U.S.-licensed comparatorto demonstrate biosimila
rity and/or interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. Over the next several years, the FDA is expected to issue additionaldraft and final guid
ance documents impacting biosimilars. In addition, in 2017, the Biosimilar User Fee Act was reauthorized for a five-year period, which shouldlead to a significant incre
ase in the FDA’s biosimilar user fee revenues, thereby providing the FDA with additional resources to process biosimilar applications.Also, there have been ongoing federal leg
islative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA.While none of those efforts have focused on change
s to the provisions of the ACA related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if those efforts continue in 2018and if the ACA is repeale
d, substantially modified, or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.Sales and Marketing 
. The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that areintended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare 
industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickbacklaws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws ge
nerally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration togenerate business, inclu
ding the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willinglypresenting, or causing to be presented, any c
laims for payment for goods (including drugs) or services to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid)that are false or fraudulent and generall
y treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishableby criminal or civil sanctions and/or 
exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The federal government and various statesalso have enacted laws 
to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactionsbetween manufacturers and healthcare prov
iders; require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions; and/or require theadoption of compliance standards or p
rograms. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance forimplementation. Individua
l states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugsunder state consum
er protection and false advertising laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to thepenalties under the pertinent law
s and regulations.Pricing and Reimbursement 
. Pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebateson purchases of pharmaceutical produ
cts under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceilingprice” drug pricing prog
ram, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices to government agenciesunder healthcare programs, such as the Med
icaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported arecomplex and the failure to report pr
ices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income 
— Revenues — Overview section in our 2017 Financial Report and in t he Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 1G. Basis of Presentation and Significa
nt Accounting Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2017 Financial Report, wh ich are incorporated by reference.Government and private third-party pa
yers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states usepreferred drug lists to restr
ict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for some Pfizer products in certain states. As anotherexample, access to our products under the 
Medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agenciescontract to provide s
ervices to Medicaid beneficiaries. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states areconsidering a variety of co
st-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments. Inaddition, we expect that consol
idation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers, who are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products inthe U.S., will increase competitive 
and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.Efforts by governmen
t officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drugimportation, could adverse
ly affect our business if implemented. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricingand proposals to address the perceived h
igh cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generallyhave focused on increasing transparen
cy around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Recent legislation enacted includes, for example, a 2017 Maryland law thatprohibits a generic drug manufactu
rer or wholesale distributor from engaging in price gouging in the sale of certain off-patent or generic drugs, and a 2017California law that 
requires manufacturers to provide advanced notification of price increases to certain purchasers and report specified drug pricing informationto the state. 
Certain state legislation, like t he Maryland law, has been subject to legal challenges . Adoption of new legislat
ion at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. We believe medicines are the most efficientand effective use of healthcare dolla
rs based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We will continue to work with law makers and advocatefor solutions that effectivel
y improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and ensure access to medicines within an efficient andaffordable healthcare system.
Healthcare Reform. 
The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pa ss legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. For example, inMarch 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the A
CA that expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individualhealth insurance exchanges and wh
ich included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.Under President Trump’s ad
ministration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA, although the current likelihoodof repeal of the ACA appears low g
iven the failure of the Senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of ACA provisions. In October 2017, thePresident signed an Executi
ve Order directing federal agencies to look for ways to authorize more health plans that could be less expensive because the planswould not have to meet all of the AC
A’s coverage requirements, and announced that his administration will withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to healthinsurance exchange plans serv
ing low-income enrollees. In December 2017, the comprehensive tax reform package signed into law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,includes a provision that 
effectively repealed the ACA’s individual mandate by removing the penalties. These and similar actions by the administration are widelyexpected to lead to fewer American
s having comprehensive ACA-compliant health insurance, even in the absence of a full legislative repeal. The revenuesgenerated for Pfizer by the health insu
rance exchanges under the ACA are minor, so the impact of the recent administration actions is expected to be limited. Wealso may face uncertainties 
if our industry is looked to for savings to fund certain legislation, such as lifting the debt ceiling. One recent example is the BipartisanBudget Act of 2018, which increased the d
iscount we pay in the Medicare Part D coverage gap from 50% to 70%, which will modestly reduce our future MedicarePart D revenues.
We cannot predict the ultimate content, t
iming or effect of any changes to the ACA or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal orstate healthcare re
form will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.Anti-Corruption. 
The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreigngovernment official, government 
staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPAincludes interactions with certain
 healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
Outside the United StatesWe encounter similar regulatory
 and legislative issues in most other countries.New Drug Approvals. 
In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be a chieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EUCentralized Procedure. These p
rocedures apply in the EU member states, plus the European Economic Area countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. TheCentralized Procedure, managed b
y the EMA, results in one single authorization for the whole EU which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gainingapproval across the EU and i
s the one most commonly used for new products.In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry fo
r businesses looking to sell drugs in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities,including clin
ical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drug product may bemarketed in Japan. 
The PMDA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals.Historically, China’s regulatory system has 
presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry, as its requirements for drug development andregistration have not alway
s been consistent with U.S. or other international standards. The CFDA, however, has introduced reforms and draft reforms in recentyears, which are discu
ssed in more detail below, that attempt to address these challenges, with 2017 being an especially active year in this respect. In the past, ithas been common to see treatments entering the Ch
inese market two to eight years behind first marketing in the U.S. and Europe, because historically Chinahas only issued import drug 
licenses to treatments approved by mature regulatory authorities such as the FDA or the EMA. In addition, to obtain marketingapprovals for new drugs
 in China, a clinical trial authorization issued by the CFDA has historically been required for the conduct of Phase I to III clinical trials.Applications for approval o
f imported drugs that included China-originated data in their Multi-Regional Clinical Trials and met the relevant technical reviewrequirements were allowed to
 receive local clinical trial waivers on a case-by-case basis. Historically, oral generics only had to undergo bioequivalence studiesupon a filing for recor
d with the CFDA, while sterile injectable generics often needed local confirmatory trials for regulatory approval. A Chinese drug licensewould only be granted
 if, following review, the CFDA determines that the clinical data confirm the drug’s safety and effectiveness.Health authorities in man
y middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of theFDA or the EMA) before
 they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data inthe country’s population in orde
r to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the U.S. andEurope.
Pharmacovigilance. 
In the EU, there is detailed leg islation and guidance on pharmacovigilance, which has been increased and strengthened in recent years. TheEMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee
 has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EUauthorities. EU regulator
s may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any timeafterwards in light of sc
ientific developments. There are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additionalmonitoring of products. Outside deve
loped markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, butthere is a trend t
oward increasing regulation.Pricing and Reimbursement 
. In Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and some other international markets, governments provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the po
int of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursementlevels to control costs fo
r the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. Governments, including thedifferent EU Member States, may u
se a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, healthtechnology assessments, and internat
ional reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries). Thisinternational patchwork of pr
ice regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in differentcountries, varying health outco
mes and some third-party trade in our products between countries.In particular, internationa
l reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and can hinder patient access and innovation. Pricevariations, exacerbated by inte
rnational reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The downward pricing pressure resultingfrom this dynamic can be expected to 
continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in someEuropean countries.
In addition, several impor
tant multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD), are increasing scrutiny of
 international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations (e.g., 2016 UN High Level Panel Report on Access to Me
dicines and 2017 OECD Report on New Health Technologies — Managing Access, Value and Sustainability ). Government adoption of these recommendations
 may lead to additional pricing pressures.In Japan, the government recently released a ba
sic framework for pharmaceutical pricing that will lead to the adoption of cost effectiveness assessments in someform, quarterly pricing reviews f
or new indications, and severe narrowing of the criteria to gain a price maintenance premium. In China, despite removal ofgovernment-set price caps the govern
ment continues to exercise indirect price control by setting reimbursement standards through a negotiation mechanismbetween drug manu
facturers and social insurance administrations. Provincial biddings, cross-regional procurement and secondary hospital price negotiations arelikely to intensify as governme
nt cost containment efforts continue.EU Regulatory Changes 
. The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, which is expected to come into effect some time in late 2019. Thisregulation is aimed at simplifying 
and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the EU and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results.Under its Publication of Clinical Data f
or Medicinal Products for Human Use policy, the EMA proactively publishes clinical trial data from application dossiers fornew marketing authorization
s, including data from trials taking place outside the EU, after the EMA has made a decision on the marketing authorization. Thepolicy includes limited exceptions for
 commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data.Brexit 
. In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. In March 2017, the U.K. governmentformally notified the European 
Council of its intention to leave the EU after it triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation processestablishing the terms of the ex
it and outlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. Formal negotiations officially started in June 2017. Thisprocess continues to be highly 
complex and the end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general businessoperations in the U.K. and the EU, 
including the approval and supply of our products. It was announced in November 2017 that the EMA will be relocating fromLondon, U.K. to Amsterdam, Netherland
s by the expected date of Brexit in March 2019. At present, it is still unclear whether and to what extent the U.K. willremain within or aligned to 
the EU system of medicines regulation, and/or what separate requirements will be imposed in the U.K. after it leaves the EU. Foradditional information on
 Brexit, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liq uidity and Capital Resources — Global Economic Conditions — U.K. in our 2017 Financial Report 
. China Regulatory Changes 
. In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval, the CFDA has unveilednumerous reform initiatives f
or China’s drug approval system, and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities. The CFDA now divides drugs into newdrugs and generics, with the defin
ition for new drugs changed from “China New” to “Global New.” This means that drugs previously approved in other markets
(such as the U.S. or Europe) will not be considered new drugs under China’s regulatory regime, with the exception of drugs introduced within one year ofapproval in mature markets. Th
is change in definition creates more opportunities for China’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms, becausemultinational firms have historically ha
d significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of China.The 2017 revisions made clear, ho
wever, that regulatory approval from the FDA or the EMA would no longer be required for approval of imported drugs, thougha notable exception
 persists for imported vaccines, which still require prior approval from a relevant regulatory agency. The “marketing authorization holder”system, which will allow for more flexibility in contrac
t manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers, now applies to all drugs developed and manufactured inChina, but not yet to imported drugs.
While challenges re
main, a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in China. Thesereforms, along with China’s Jun
e 2017 entry into the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, areexpected to pave
 the way for integration of CFDA’s regulations with global practices. These changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization forall three phases of registrat
ion studies (instead of the original phase-by-phase approvals), a filing/recordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics(instead of the original rev
iew and approval system), admitting more categories of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast track/“green channel” approvalpathway and ongoing implementation of p
reviously announced regulatory reforms.Healthcare Provider Transpar
ency and Disclosures. A number of countries  have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended)disclosure of transfers o
f value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers. For example, the EFPIA’s disclosure code requires all members,including Pfizer, to d
isclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations.Intellectual Property 
. The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (WTO-TRIPS) required participant countries toamend their intellectual p
roperty laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005, with an extension until 2033 for least-developedcountries. While we 
still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world, some countries have made improvements.We include stronger patent protect
ion among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries.While the global intellectual pro
perty environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future businessgrowth depends on further progress in 
intellectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual propertypolicies as a tool for red
ucing the price of imported medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. There is considerable political andeconomic pressure to weaken ex
isting intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policies such as morerestrictive standards for obta
ining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types ofinventions (e.g., new medica
l treatment methods), revocation of patents, issuance (and threat of issuance) of compulsory licenses, weak intellectual propertyenforcement and failure to imple
ment effective regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environmentfor foreign manufacturers, as we
ll as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries. In developed countriesas well, including the EU, we are
 facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment.Canada’s intellectua
l property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity (eight years plus six-month pediatric extension), butit lacks the predictabi
lity and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide. Through intense negotiations as part of the Canada/EU ComprehensiveEconomic & Trade Agreement (
CETA), Canadian authorities reluctantly agreed to introduce a right of appeal, a form of patent term restoration and to elevate thecurrent data protection to a treaty obligat
ion, further aligning its intellectual property regime to the EU. In particular, CETA Article 20.25 provides sui generis protection for patent term extensions of t
wo to five years for basic patents, subject to various rules and limitations.In China, the intellectual p
roperty environment has improved, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern. Thegovernment has tak
en steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, and several companies, includingPfizer, have established R&D ce
nters in China due to increased confidence in China’s intellectual property environment. Despite this, China remained on theU.S. Trade Representative’
s Priority Watch List for 2017. Further, the standards for patentability in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets,including the U.S., Europe and Japan. 
Also, while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking orinconsistent. For example, the absen
ce of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightenedsufficiency standards have been used to 
invalidate patents at the enforcement stage.In Brazil and other L
atin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil),restrictive patentabil
ity rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products throughpatents. The lack of regulatory data protect
ion and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit thecommercial lifespan of some p
harmaceutical products.In India, we have seen some progress 
in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs toenhance enforcement. Despite these posit
ive steps, gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns. For example, policiesfavoring compulsory l
icensing of patents, the tendency of the Indian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings (both pre- andpost-grant), and restrictive 
standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investmentsin innovation. These polic
ies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products, especially in areas perceived asbeing important to the public health of the popu
lation. Challenges against Pfizer patents in India are ongoing.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Most of our operations are affected by nationa
l, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expendituresnecessary for compliance with 
applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notesto Consolidated Financial St
atements— Note 17A3. Commitments a nd Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Commercial and Other Matters in our 2017 Financial Report. As a re
sult, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2017 for environmental compl iance purposes and for the clean-up of certainpast industrial activity as follows:
•
environment-related capital expenditures— $30 million ; and •
other environment-related expenses— $142 million . While capital expenditures or 
operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have amaterial effect on o
ur capital expenditures or competitive position.Climate change presents r
isks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for morefrequent and severe weather events and water ava
ilability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. For example, in 2017, ourmanufacturing and commercia
l operations in Puerto Rico were impacted by hurricanes. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Out
look — Our Business — Impact of Recent Hurricanes in Puerto Rico section of the 2017 Financial Repo rt. We cannotprovide assurance that physica
l risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a program for
reviewing our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we have concluded that, because of ourfacility locations, our existing distrib
ution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the near term.TAX MATTERS

: MANAGED CARE TRENDS
Consolidation among MCOs has
 increased the negotiating power of MCOs and other private insurers. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments,increasingly employ formularies to c
ontrol costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain or maintain timely oradequate pricing or formulary p
lacement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue. Inaddition to formulary tier 
co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required frombeneficiaries, particu
larly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. They are also trying newer programs like copay accumulators to shift more ofthe cost burden to manufacturers and patients. Thi
s cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion oftheir prescription costs an
d may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. MCOs also use additional measures suchas new-to-market blocks, exclusio
n lists, indication-based pricing, and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts. Private healthinsurance companies also ar
e increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product ifa generic product is avai
lable or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S.payer market concentrates further and as mo
re drugs become available in generic form, biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure fromprivate third-party payers
, who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.GENERIC COMPETITION
Competition from manufacturer
s of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world, and the loss or expiration of intellectualproperty rights can have a sign
ificant adverse effect on our revenues. The date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that thepatent or regulatory exclusi
vity expires. However, upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despitepending patent infringement lit
igation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, we can losethe major portion of revenues for that product 
in a very short period of time, which can adversely affect our business. A number of our products are expected toface significantly increased g
eneric competition over the next few years.Also, generic manufacturers ha
ve filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents;these include candidates that wou
ld compete with, among other products, Xeljanz and Xtandi . Our licensing and collabor ation partners also face challenges bygeneric drug manufacturers to patents cove
ring products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights. In addition, our patent-protected products may facecompetition in the form of generi
c versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS
We cannot predict with accu
racy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products, including new product entrants, in-line branded products,generic products, private labe
l products, biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs anddrug candidates. The introduction of compet
itive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products indevelopment, as well as unant
icipated product obsolescence. Competitive product launches have occurred in recent years, and certain potentially competitiveproducts are in various stages of de
velopment, some of which have been filed for approval with the FDA and with regulatory authorities in other countries.We also produce generic 
and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with products from competitors, including other generic and biosimilarmanufacturers. The ability to 
launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before the anticipated formation of the generic or biosimilar marketplaceis important to that
 product’s profitability. Prices for products typically decline, sometimes dramatically, following generic or biosimilar entry, and as additionalcompanies receive approva
ls to market that product, competition intensifies. If a company’s generic or biosimilar product can be “first-to-market” such that its onlycompetition is the branded drug for a per
iod of time, higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter themarket. With increasing compe
tition in the generic or biosimilar product market, the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products willincrease in importance. O
ur success will depend on our ability to bring new products to market quickly. Also, we may face access challenges for our biosimilarproducts where our product may not rece
ive access at parity to the innovator product and remains in a disadvantaged position. For example, Inflectra/Remsima has experienced access c
hallenges among commercial payers. In September 2017, Pfizer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District ofPennsylvania against Johns
on & Johnson (J&J) alleging that J&J’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning Remicade® (infliximab)violate federal antitrust
 laws.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSDEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE PRODUCTS
We recorded direct product and/or a
lliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine biopharmaceutical products in 2017: Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 , Lyrica, 
Ibrance , Eliquis , Enbrel , Lipitor , Xeljanz , Viagra and Sutent . Those products accounted for 46% of our total revenues in 2017 . If these products or any of our other major products were to beco
me subject to problems such as loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription growth rates, materialproduct liability 
litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitiveproducts, changes in labeling, a
ccess pressures or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could besignificant. Patents coverin
g several of our best-selling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years (including some of our billion-dollarand previously bil
lion-dollar products), and patents covering a number of our best-selling medicines are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges.For example, as a result of a patent l
itigation settlement, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. launched a generic version of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017. In addition, our revenues could be s
ignificantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products. For additional information, see theOverview of Our Performance, Ope
rating Environment, Strategy and Outlook –– Our Operating Environment — Industry-Specific Challenges — IntellectualProperty Rights and Collabora
tion/Licensing Rights — Recent Losses and Expected Losses of Product Exclusivity section in our 2017 Financial Report. Further, our Alliance revenue
s will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co-promotion agreements that we have entered intoand that we may enter into from time to t
ime. For additional information on recent losses of collaborations rights, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Out
look –– Our Operating Environment — Industry-Specific Challenges — Intellectual Property Rights andCollaboration/Licensing Rights 
— Recent Losses of Collaboration Rights section in our 2017 Financial Report. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT
The discovery and development of safe, effect
ive new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for thecontinued strength of our businesses. Our p
roduct lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their marketexclusivity, as 
well as to provide for earnings growth. Our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or newindications for exist
ing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers, either through internal R&D or throughcollaborations, acquis
itions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties. However, balancing current growth, investment for future growthand the delivery of shareholder retu
rn remains a major challenge. The average costs of product development continue to rise, as do the regulatory requirementsin many therapeutic areas, wh
ich may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the R&D portfolio. Our ongoing investments in newproduct introductions and in R
&D for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth.Additionally, our R
&D investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets, and failure to invest in the right technologyplatforms, therapeutic segments, produ
ct classes, geographic markets and/or in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipelinecould adversely impact the p
roductivity of our pipeline. Further, even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified, the science may not workfor any given program despite the s
ignificant investment required for R&D, and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expectedbecause of the highly dynamic ma
rket environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement.We continue to strengthen our global 
R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve asustainable pipeline that 
will deliver value in the near term and over time. There can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result, whichcould affect profita
bility in the future.BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS
Abbreviated legal pathways
 for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage of the ACA, a framework for suchapproval exists in the U.
S. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products, our biotechnology productsmay become subject to competit
ion from these biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. For example, Enbrel faces ongoing biosimilar competition in m
ost developed Europe markets, which is expected to continue. The expiration or successful challenge of applicable patentrights could trigger this com
petition, assuming any relevant regulatory exclusivity period has expired. We may face litigation with respect to the validity and/orscope of patents relating to our biotechno
logy products.We are developing biosimilar medicines.
 The evolving pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products by the FDA and regulatory authorities incertain other countries
 could diminish the value of our investments in biosimilars. Other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential forsteeper than an
ticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity, coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual propertychallenges that may pr
eclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products. There is also a risk of lower prescriptions for biosimilars due topotential concerns over
 comparability with innovator medicines. See also the Competitive Products risk factor above. Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSRESEARCH STUDIES
Decisions about research 
studies made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategyand payer reimbursement possib
ilities if it receives regulatory approval. For example, a wider range of studies can lead to approval for a broader set ofindications that may impa
ct the marketing and payer reimbursement process. However, each additional indication must be balanced against the time andresources required to demonstrate benef
it, the increased complexity of development and the potential delays to approval of the lead indication. We try to planclinical tria
ls prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed anddesired outcome wil
l be achieved each time. The degree to which such potential challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results.RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Our international operations cou
ld be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions,changes in intellectual p
roperty legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, andmarketing of, reimbursement for and a
ccess to our products, as well as by political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmentaldisputes. Any of these changes could adve
rsely affect our business.Many emerging markets have exper
ienced growth rates in excess of developed markets, leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s globalperformance. As a result, we have been e
mploying strategies to grow in emerging markets. However, there is no assurance that our strategies in emergingmarkets will be successful or tha
t these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates. In addition, some emerging market countries may be particularlyvulnerable to periods o
f financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending. Even though weconstantly monitor the
 evolving emerging markets for any unanticipated risk to Pfizer, certain financial or political events in such markets, as discussed above,can adversely affect 
our results.SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS
Specialty pharmaceuticals are m
edicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations. The growing availability anduse of innovative specialt
y pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, has generatedpayer interest in developing 
cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. The impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialtypharmaceuticals is 
increasing. For Pfizer to date, a number of factors create a more challenging paradigm given our growing specialty business portfolio. Theseinclude formulary rest
rictions and dispensation barriers, such as step edits, leading to higher negotiated rebates or discounts to health plans and PBMs in theU.S., as well as the increasing
 use of health technology assessments in markets around the world.CONSUMER HEALTHCARE
The Consumer Healthcare bus
iness may be impacted by economic volatility, the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, generic or store brandcompetition affecting consumer 
spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands. In addition, regulatory andlegislative outcomes regarding
 the safety, efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our Consumer Healthcare products may require withdrawal,reformulation and/or relabel
ing of certain products (e.g., cough/cold products). See The Global Economic Environme nt and Strategic Alternatives for PfizerConsumer Healthcare 
risk factors below. PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALES AND MARKETING RISKS
Difficulties or de
lays in product manufacturing, sales or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions, shut-downs, approval delays,withdrawals, recalls, penalties, sup
ply disruptions or shortages, reputational harm, product liability, unanticipated costs or otherwise. Examples of such difficultiesor delays include, but are not l
imited to, the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; the failure to predict market demand for, or togain market acceptance of, approved products; the po
ssibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality ofincoming materials 
may be substandard and not detected; the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal andexternal supply network a
nd/or comply with cGMPs and other applicable regulations such as serialization (which allows for track and trace of products in thesupply chain to enhance patient safety); 
risks to supply chain continuity and commercial operations as a result of natural (including hurricanes, earthquakes andfloods) or man-made disaster
s at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor, including those that may be related to climate change; or failure to maintain the integrityof our supply chains against 
intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration, product diversion, product theft, counterfeit goods and cyberattacks.Regulatory agencies periodically insp
ect our drug manufacturing facilities to evaluate compliance with applicable cGMP requirements. Failure to comply withthese requirements may subject u
s to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions,debarment or voluntary recal
l of a product, any ofPfizer Inc.
2017 Form 10-K 13 
TABLE OF CONTENTSwhich could have a materia
l adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In February 2017, we received a warning letter from theFDA communicating the FDA’s view th
at certain violations of cGMP regulations exist at Hospira’s manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas. We areundertaking corrective act
ions to address the concerns raised by the FDA. In January 2018, the FDA upgraded the status of Pfizer’s McPherson, Kansasmanufacturing facility to 
Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) based on an October 2017 inspection. The change to VAI status will lift the compliance hold that theFDA placed on approval of pending app
lications, and is an important step toward resolving the issues cited in the February 2017 FDA warning letter. In addition,in September 2017,
 Meridian, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., received a warning letter from the FDA asserting the FDA’s view that certain violations of cGMP andQuality System Regulations exist 
at Meridian’s manufacturing sites in St. Louis, Missouri. We are undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raisedby the FDA, and communication 
with the FDA is ongoing. Until the corrective actions are implemented and approved by the FDA, the FDA may refuse to grantpremarket approval of applicat
ions and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates related to products manufactured at our St. Louis, Missouri sites.OUTSOURCING AND ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
We outsource certain services
 to third parties in areas including transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, clinical trialexecution, clinical lab services, no
n-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities management and other areas. For example, in 2017, we placed themajority of our clinical trial execution
 services with four Clinical Research Organizations (CROs). Service performance issues with these CROs may adverselyimpact the progression 
of our clinical trial programs. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to sub-optimal quality of service delivery ordeliverables, which may result in re
percussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous data, supply disruptions, non-compliance(including with applicable legal requirem
ents and industry standards) or reputational harm, with potential negative implications for our results.We are migrating to a consi
stent enterprise resource planning system across the organization. These are enhancements of ongoing activities to standardize ourfinancial systems. If any d
ifficulties in the migration to or in the operation of our enterprise resource planning system were to occur, they could adversely affectour operations, including, among othe
r ways, through a failure to meet demand for our products, or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reportingobligations.
COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We depend on third-party collabo
rators, service providers, and others in the research, development and commercialization of our products and productcandidates and also enter into jo
int ventures and other business development transactions in connection with our business. To achieve expected longer termbenefits, we may make substantia
l upfront payments in such transactions, which may negatively impact our reported earnings. We rely heavily on these partiesfor multiple aspects of our drug de
velopment, manufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not control many aspects of those activities. Third partiesmay not complete activit
ies on schedule or in accordance with our expectations. Failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or otherobligations to Pfizer; fa
ilure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations; or any disruption in the relationships between Pfizer andone or more of these third parties, cou
ld delay or prevent the development, approval or commercialization of our products and product candidates and could alsoresult in non-compliance or r
eputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business.BIOPHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS
In 
2017 , our largest biopharm aceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately 16% of our total reven ues (and approximately 33% of our total U.S. revenues), and our top three biopharmaceutical 
wholesalers accounted for approximately 38% of our total reven ues (and approximately 79% of our total U.S. revenues). If one of our significant biopharma
ceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business thatit does with us, and we might be unab
le to collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact ourresults of operations.
 In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricingpressures on pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, including us.BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
We expect to continue to enhance our in-
line products and product pipeline through collaborations, alliances, license and funding agreements, joint ventures,equity- or debt-based investments, 
mergers and acquisitions. However, these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriateopportunities, competitio
n from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure andexecute transactions, includ
ing the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all, and integrateacquisitions. Further, while we s
eek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks andliabilities that 
such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Legal proceedings or regulatory issues oftenarise as a result of activ
ities that occurred at acquired companies, their partners and other third parties. In 2016, for example, we paid $784.6 million to resolveallegations related to Wyeth
’s reporting of prices to the government with respect to Protonix for activities that occurred prior to ourPfizer Inc.

itionally, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, including the possibility that expected synergies and accretionwill not be realized or will not be r
ealized within the expected time frame.COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
A counterfeit medicine i
s one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source. A counterfeit Pfizer medicine, therefore, is onemanufactured by someone other than Pfizer, but 
which appears to be the same as an authentic Pfizer medicine. The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is asignificant and growing 
industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the Internet, which hasgreatly facilitated the ease by 
which counterfeit medicines can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual patients; the availability of sophisticatedtechnology that makes it easier fo
r counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines; the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under-regulatedwholesalers and repackagers
; the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct tocustomers in small pa
rcel packages; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by themfrom the sale of counterfeit medic
ines. Further, laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country, and the enforcement of existinglaw varies greatly from jurisdiction to
 jurisdiction. For example, in some countries, pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime; in others, it may result in onlyminimal sanctions. In add
ition, those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls bydisguising the true sourc
e of their products.Pfizer’s global reputat
ion makes its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safetybecause of the conditions under whi
ch they are manufactured—often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack ofregulation of their contents. Fai
lure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines, which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain, could adverselyimpact our business, by, among other th
ings, causing the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines, potentially resultingin lost sales, product rec
alls, and an increased threat of litigation.We undertake significant effort
s to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines, including, among other things, working with the FDA and otherregulatory authorities and mu
ltinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecutecounterfeiters; assessing ne
w and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients andhealthcare providers to dist
inguish authentic from counterfeit medicines; implementing business practices designed to protect patient health; promoting publicpolicies intended to hind
er counterfeiting; working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines; and working collaborativelywith wholesalers, pharmacies, cust
oms offices, and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels, and improvesurveillance of dist
ributors and repackagers. No assurance can be given, however, that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful, and thepresence of counterfeit medicine
s may continue to increase.RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
: PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT
U.S. and international governmenta
l regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid bygovernment entities or programs fo
r our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations orpolicies.
In the U.S., many of our products are subje
ct to increasing pricing pressures. Pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and publicscrutiny and calls for 
reform. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints underthe Medicaid program, and some states a
re considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Efforts by governm
ent officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payments for pharmaceutical products, including legislation ondrug importation, could
 adversely affect our business if implemented. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceuticalproduct pricing, which 
could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures for our products mayoccur as a result of 
highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seekingenhanced discounts 
or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.We encounter similar 
regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In certain international markets, such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada and SouthKorea, governments have signif
icant power as large single payers to regulate prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health technologyassessments), or other means of cost 
control, particularly under recent global financing pressures. As a result, we expect that pressures on the pricingcomponent of op
erating results will continue.The adoption of
 restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions, failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequatepricing or formulary p
lacement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue. In ourvaccines business, we participat
e in a tender process in manyPfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTScountries for participation
 in national immunization programs. Failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing inthe tender process could adversel
y affect our business.U.S. HEALTHCARE REFORM/HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION
The U.S. healthcare industry 
is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. For example, the ACA was enacted by Congress in March2010 and established a major expans
ion of healthcare coverage, financed in part by a number of new rebates, discounts, and taxes that had a significant effecton our expenses and profitabilit
y. See the discussion under the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy and Outlook — Our OperatingEnvironment 
— Industry-Specific Challenges — Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access — U.S. Healthcare Legislation section in our 2017 Financial Report and in 
Item 1. Business under the caption Government Regulation and Price Constraints—In the United States . We face uncertainties  due to federal legislativeand administrative efforts to repea
l, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. The likelihood of such a repeal currently appearslow given the recent failu
re of the Senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of such ACA provisions. In October 2017, the President signed anExecutive Order direct
ing federal agencies to look for ways to authorize more health plans that could be less expensive because the plans would not have tomeet all of the ACA’s covera
ge requirements, and announced that his administration will withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchangeplans serving low-income enrollees. 
These and similar actions by the administration are widely expected to lead to fewer Americans having comprehensive ACA-compliant health insurance, e
ven in the absence of a legislative repeal. The revenues generated for Pfizer by the health insurance exchanges under the ACA areminor, so the impact of the recent adm
inistration actions is expected to be limited. There is no assurance that any future replacement, modification or repeal ofthe ACA will not adversely affec
t our business and financial results, particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employer-sponsored insurance coverage,and we cannot predict how future federal o
r state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.Other U.S. federal or state legi
slative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others, changes in patentlaws, the importation of pres
cription drugs from outside the U.S. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries (which is among theU.S. presidential administration’s p
olicy proposals), restrictions on U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals,or the use of comparative effectivenes
s methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes thetherapeutic differenc
es among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines.U.S. ENTITLEMENT REFORM
In the U.S., government action to reduce federa
l spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our products orservices provided us
ing our products. The Congressional Budget Office routinely releases options for reducing federal spending, and the December 2016 releaseincludes proposals to cap Med
icaid grants to the states, and to require manufacturers to pay a minimum rebate on drugs covered under part D of Medicare forlow-income beneficiaries. Significant Me
dicare reductions could also result if Congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the Medicare fee-for-serviceprogram into a premium support prog
ram, or Congress chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the Medicare Payment AdvisoryCommission, which are primarily intended 
to extend the fiscal solvency of the Medicare program. These and any other significant spending reductions or costcontrols affecting Medicare, 
Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on ourresults of operations.
SUBSTANTIAL REGULATION
We are subject to extensive, co
mplex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the U.S., principally by the FDA and theDEA, and foreign regula
tory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminalprosecution, monetary
 penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension,revocation of approvals, or exc
lusion from future participation in government healthcare programs.DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS
Innovation is critica
l to the success of our company, and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. The outcome of thelengthy and complex process of 
identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost. Theprocess from early dis
covery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years. Drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process,including as the result o
f unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data.There can be no
 assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical and clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatory submissionand approval dates, and launch dates for product cand
idates, or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for newindications or dosage forms fo
r existing products, which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile suggested by thetotality of the efficacy and safety 
information submitted. Decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters could adverselyaffect the availability o
r commercial potential of our products. There is no assurance that we will be able to addressPfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSthe comments received by us from 
regulatory authorities such as the FDA and the EMA with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of thoseauthorities, that any of our pipel
ine products will receive regulatory approval and, if approved, be commercially successful or that recently approved products willbe approved in other markets and/or be comme
rcially successful. There is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findingsconcerning the adequacy of our regulatory 
compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatorycompliance and to address future regu
latory agency findings, should they occur. In addition, there are risks associated with preliminary, early stage or interimdata, including the risk 
that final results of studies for which preliminary, early stage or interim data have been provided and/or additional clinical trials may bedifferent from (including 
less favorable than) the preliminary, early stage or interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicableproduct candidate or indication. In add
ition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support thesafety and/or effectiveness of a product cand
idate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may requireadditional data or may deny approva
l altogether.There are many considerations that can affe
ct the marketing of our products around the world. Regulatory delays, the inability to successfully complete oradequately design a
nd implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality, time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations,claims and concerns about safety and eff
icacy, new discoveries, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that canadversely affect our business. Fu
rther, claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can resultin a negative impact o
n product sales, product recalls or withdrawals, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Increasingregulatory scrutiny of drug safet
y and efficacy, with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the risk/benefit profile of products as theyrelate to already-approved products, ha
s resulted in a more challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for, among otherthings, additional clinical trials prior t
o granting approval or increased post-approval requirements, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.In addition, failure to put in pla
ce adequate controls and/or resources for effective collection, reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials andpost-marketing surveillance, in c
ompliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety, regulatory actions and risks toproduct sales.
The FDA, along with other regulato
ry agencies around the world, has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications, which may result in delayedapprovals of new generic product
s. While the FDA is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications, continued approval delays may be experiencedby generic drug applicants ove
r the next few years.POST-APPROVAL DATA
As a condition to granting market
ing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in thesePhase 4 trials could resu
lt in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of aproduct. Regulatory agencies 
in countries outside the U.S. often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies,whether conducted by us or by others and whethe
r mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such asadverse event reports, may also adve
rsely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with aproduct similar to one of our produ
cts that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability orcommercial potential of the affe
cted products. Accordingly, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand forour products due to real or perceived 
side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in updated labeling, restrictions on use,product withdrawal or recall.
INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
Risks and uncertaintie
s apply if we provide something of value to a healthcare professional, other healthcare provider and/or government official. If the interactionis found to be improper, government enforce
ment actions and penalties could result. These risks may increase as non-U.S. jurisdictions adopt or increaseenforcement efforts of new anti-bribe
ry laws and regulations. Requirements or industry standards in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad that requirepharmaceutical manufacturers to t
rack and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers increase government and publicscrutiny of such financial int
eractions.CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Our future results could be adverse
ly affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or changes in laws and regulations, including,among others, changes in accounting standard
s, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws, changes to existing tax laws and revised taxlaw and regulatory clar
ifications and/or interpretations, including changes affecting the taxation by the U.S. of income earned outside the U.S. that may resultfrom pending and possible future proposa
ls, including further clarifications and/or interpretations of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), competition laws,privacy laws and env
ironmental laws in the U.S. and other countries. For additional information, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes  on Income — Changes inTax Laws

TABLE OF CONTENTSStatements— 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2017 in our 2017 Financial Report. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We and certain of o
ur subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings, including patent, product liability and other product-related litigation, includingpersonal injury, consumer, 
off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, commercial, environmental, government investigations,employment, tax litigat
ion and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable,and excessive verdicts do o
ccur. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur judgments, enter intosettlements of claims or 
revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations in the per
iod in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.Claims against our patents 
include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. Although we believe we havesubstantial defenses to these chal
lenges with respect to all of our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss inany of these cases could result 
in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and couldmaterially affect future
 results of operations.Like other pharmaceutical co
mpanies, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed marketsand multiple emerging marke
ts in which we operate. As a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. Criminal charges,substantial fines and/
or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, as well as reputational harm and increased publicinterest in the matt
er could result from government investigations.Our activities relat
ing to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug RebateProgram, the FCPA and other federal and state 
statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this 2017 Form 10-K, as well as anti-kickback  and false claimslaws, and similar laws in international jurisdictions
. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and othertypes of information demands from gove
rnment authorities, and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought bygovernmental authorities, as 
well as by consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and otheradverse consequences
 as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. For example, these claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures toaccurately interpret or ident
ify or prevent non-compliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information (approved andunapproved), potentially resu
lting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including socialmedia, mobile applications an
d blogger outreach.ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND PROCEEDINGS
We and certain of o
ur subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims andproceedings. Amounts recorded for cont
ingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptio
ns. While we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyondthe amounts accrued. If we fail to proper
ly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increaseour accruals for contingenc
ies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
: PATENT PROTECTION
Our long-term success la
rgely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination ofintellectual property, 
including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and licenseagreements, to protect our intellectua
l property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not beable to prevent third parties from 
launching generic versions of our branded products, using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are verysimilar or ident
ical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly, anyterm extensions that we seek may not be g
ranted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect usagainst third parties with similar t
echnologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. Thescope of our patent claims also 
may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws. We may be subject to challenges by third partiesregarding our intellectual 
property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term.Pfizer Inc.
2017 Form 10-K 18 
TABLE OF CONTENTSOur ability to enforce our patents a
lso depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual propertyrights, and the extent to which certa
in sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as aresult of local political pressure 
or in the case of national emergencies. In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permittingsome form of challenge to our patents by co
mpetitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, andgeneric companies are incre
asingly employing aggressive strategies, such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims bygeneric drug manufacturers that patents cove
ring our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drugmanufacturer. Independent actions have been filed a
lleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constituteunfair competition and/or vio
lations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents. We are alsoparty to other patent damages suits in var
ious jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seekingdamages from us for alleged delay of gene
ric entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition pro
ceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to ourintellectual property or the 
intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitiveproducts could be introduced into the ma
rket resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcalvaccine portfolio have been cha
llenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. The invalidation of these patents could potentiallyallow a competitor pneumoco
ccal vaccine into the marketplace. Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreementspursuant to which third partie
s grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results andfinancial condition could be
 materially adversely affected. Likewise, in the U.S. and othe
r countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be thesubject of a governmental or third
-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance onour trademarks and trade dress to different
iate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting,registering or using tradema
rks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.We actively seek to protect ou
r proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, otheradvisors and other third partie
s to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement orother relationship. Desp
ite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our tradesecrets or our other intelle
ctual property without authorization, and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages causedby such unauthorized
 use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectualproperty by means o
f alternative designs or processes or otherwise.THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
A properly functioning inte
llectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of othercompanies, but the patent granting process 
is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual propertyrights held by other c
ompanies that we believe were improperly granted. Such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not be successful.Part of our EH business depends upon su
ccessfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to takeadvantage of those opportunities, which 
may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities mayarise in situations 
where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired, where patents have been declared invalid, or where products do notinfringe the patents of others. To achieve a “f
irst-to-market” or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars, we may take action,such as litigation, asse
rting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable.Third parties may cla
im that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party. Claims of intellectual property infringement can becostly and time-consum
ing to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant damages. We are involved in patent-related disputeswith third parties over ou
r attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related genericpharmaceuticals products 
or biosimilars, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings (including anyappeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 
“at-risk” launch). If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party maybe awarded significant damages, o
r we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold in the eventthat we or one of our subsidiarie
s, like Hospira, is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party. Any of these adverse consequences couldhave a material adverse
 effect on our profitability and financial condition.Pfizer Inc.
2017 Form 10-K 19 
TABLE OF CONTENTSRISK RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY 
: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
Significant disrupt
ions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses. We rely to a large extentupon sophisticated information te
chnology systems to operate our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts ofconfidential information 
(including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical andprocedural controls to mainta
in the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations tothird parties, includ
ing significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationshipswith third parties who 
may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information securitysystems, and those of our third-party 
vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make suchsystems potentially vu
lnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or fromattacks by malicious third par
ties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range ofmotives (including, but not 
limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others. As a globalpharmaceutical company, our s
ystems are subject to frequent attacks. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remainundetected for a period of time. Whi
le we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts willprevent service interrupt
ions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result inthe loss of critical or sensitive c
onfidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Wemaintain cyber liability insurance; h
owever this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result froman interruption or br
each of our systems.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS 
: STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS
The success of our 
acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor, Medivation and AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business will depend, in large part, on ourability to realize anticipated 
benefits from combining these businesses with Pfizer. We, for example, may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with theacquisition of Hospira, or suc
h cost savings within the expected time frame. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from the acquisitions of Hospira, Anacorand Medivation may not be reali
zed or may be delayed. Integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoingbusiness, including third-party
 relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the revenue growthfor the acquired business that we expe
cted at the time of entering into the transaction. Expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates alsomay be constrained by
 developments outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adverselyimpact revenue and income contr
ibution from products and product candidates, including those acquired in these acquisitions. Hospira, for example, hasexperienced manufact
uring disruptions and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues, including receiving a warning letter from the FDA in February2017 communicating the FDA 
’  s view that certain violations of cGMP regulations exist at Hospira ’  s manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas. Manufacturingproblems, as well as an
y corrective actions and their operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired fromHospira and result in sub
stantial unanticipated costs. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy andOutlook 
–– Our Business — Product Manufacturing section in our 2017 Financial Report. Al so, the success of our acquisition of Medivation depends on ourability to grow revenues f
or Xtandi and expand Xtandi into the non-metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer setting.STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR PFIZER CONSUMER HEALTHCARE
In October 2017, we announced plans to revie
w a range of strategic alternatives for our Consumer Healthcare business, including a full or partial separation ofthe Consumer Healthcare bus
iness from Pfizer through a spin-off, sale or other transaction, as well as the possibility that we may ultimately determine to retainthe business. We expect that a decis
ion regarding strategic alternatives for the Consumer Healthcare business would be made in 2018.We will incur expenses in connection
 with the review of strategic alternatives and are likely to incur significant expenses if we determine to move forward with anystrategic alternatives. Our futu
re results may be affected by the impact of our review and, if applicable, consummation of strategic alternatives for our ConsumerHealthcare business, wh
ich are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of anystrategic alternatives 
we may pursue, the potential for disruption to our business and diversion of management’s attention from other aspects of our business, thepossibility that such 
strategic alternatives will not be completed on terms that are advantageous to Pfizer and the possibility that we may be unable to realize ahigher value for our Co
nsumer Healthcare through strategic alternatives.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSOTHER RISKS:
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Like all businesses, 
we are exposed to both global and industry-specific economic conditions. Governments, corporations and insurance companies, whichprovide insurance benefits to pat
ients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on access to medicines, potentially causing patients to switchto generic or biosimi
lar products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. Government financing pressures can lead to negative pricingpressure in various mar
kets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health technologyassessments), or other means of cost 
control. Examples include Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and a number of other international markets. TheU.S. continues to maintain co
mpetitive insurance markets, but has also seen significant increases in patient cost-sharing and growing government influence asgovernment programs continue to grow a
s a source of coverage.The global economic environ
ment has not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significantoperating cash flows, financ
ial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that wehave, and will mainta
in, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolvingeconomic conditions, but there can be no gua
rantee that changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capitalresources or impact our abi
lity to obtain financing in the future.We continue to monitor
 credit, capital restrictions and economic situations in volatile regions and markets, especially where the ability to obtain U.S. dollars forlocal currency is unp
redictable and challenging. We cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions, or what impact they may haveon our results of operations, financ
ial condition or business.In addition, given that a signif
icant portion of our business is conducted in the EU, including the U.K., the formal change in the relationship between the U.K. andthe EU caused by Brexit may po
se certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including theapproval and supply o
f our products. Details on how Brexit will be executed and the impact on the remaining EU countries will dictate how and whether thebroader EU will be 
impacted and what the resulting impact on our business may be. For additional information, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liq uidityand Capital Resources 
— Global Economic Conditions — U.K. section in our 2017 Financial Report. We also continue to monitor the g
lobal trade environment and potential trade conflicts. If trade restrictions reduce global economic activity, or if other factors leadto a general economic downturn, potentia
l impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of ourfinancial assets and pension p
lan investments; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased government cost control efforts; delays orfailures in the performance of cu
stomers, suppliers, and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that ourallowance for doubtful accounts 
may not be adequate.FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK
Significant portions of our 
revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates.50% 
of our total 2017 revenues were derived fr om international operations, including 21% from Europe and 20% from Japan and the rest of Asia. As we ope ratein multiple foreign cu
rrencies, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the U.K. pound, the Canadian dollar and approximately 100 othercurrencies, changes in those cu
rrencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken against anothercurrency, assuming all other
 variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses wouldincrease, having a negative i
mpact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variablesremained constant, our revenues wou
ld decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact onearnings. Therefore, signifi
cant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.The impact of possible c
urrency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results andfinancial guidance. For addit
ional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment,Strategy and Outlook––Our Financia
l Guidance for 2018 and Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources sections in our 2017 Financial Report.
In addition, our interest-bearing 
investments and borrowings, and our pension benefit obligations, net, and our postretirement benefit obligations, net, are subjectto risk from changes in inte
rest rates and foreign exchange rates. These risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in theForward-Looking Information and Facto
rs That May Affect Future Results — Financial Risk Management section in our 2017 Financial Report. For ad ditionaldetails, see the Notes to Conso

2017 Financial Report are incorpor ated by reference.Notwithstanding our efforts to fore
see and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in currencyand interest rates, inflation or othe
r related factors affecting our businesses.COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL EVENTS/FAILURE TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF STRATEG
IC INITIATIVES ANDACQUISITIONS
Growth in costs and expenses, changes 
in product, segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internalreorganizations, product w
ithdrawals, recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization andorganizational restructur
ing could adversely affect future results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of(i) our cost-reduction an
d productivity initiatives; (ii) our internal separation of our commercial operations into our current operating structure; (iii) any othercorporate strategic initiatives
, such as our evaluation of strategic alternatives for our Consumer Healthcare business; and (iv) any acquisitions, divestitures orother initiatives, such as 
our acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor, Medivation and AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business.INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS
Our consolidated balanc
e sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant, and therecan be no certainty that these assets ult
imately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that weinvest in a large number of pro
jects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investmentsis often contingent upon, among other things, regu
latory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many of these IPR&D assets will becomeimpaired and be written off at some t
ime in the future. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwillimpairment charge (such as, a
mong other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change inlegal matters or in the busine
ss climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity). Any such charge may be significant. Ourother intangible assets, inc
luding developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significantas well. For additional det
ails, see the Significant Accounting Policies and  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions section in our 2017 Financial Report.
We also regularly re
view our equity-method investments for impairment. An impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events ormanagement decisions that impact ou
r estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. We may recognize impairment charges as aresult of a weak economic env
ironment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management.INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The accuracy of our financial 
reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting canprovide only reasonable assu
rance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements.Failure to maintain eff
ective internal control over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could undermine the ability to provideaccurate disclosure (including with r
espect to financial information) on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures (includingwith respect to financia
l information), require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency, and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings.TERRORIST ACTIVITY
Our future results could be adverse
ly affected by changes in business, political and economic conditions, including the cost and availability of insurance, due tothe threat of terrorist activit
y in the U.S. and other parts of the world and related U.S. military action overseas.Pfizer Inc.

ly set forth in Part F of the PCCP. While the Code places limitations on the maximum amount of an employee’s compensation that maybe taken into account for determining benef
its payable under a qualified plan, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”‘),permits the payment under an “unfunded plan” of the benef
its which may not be paid under a qualified plan because of such limitation. The purpose of this Planis to provide a certain le
vel of additional benefits which may not be provided under the pension plan because of the maximum compensation limitation of theCode. Effective January 1, 2006, parti
cipation in, and accruals under, the Plan were frozen.ARTICLE 2

We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of
healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. We work across
developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our 
time. We collaborate with healthcareproviders, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our
products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us (Alliance revenues).
We manage our commercial operations through 
two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). For additional information, seeNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 18A. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information: Segment  Information and the “Our Strategy––Commercial Operations” section of this Financial Review below.
The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated. As
a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. These factors include, among others: the
 loss or expiration ofintellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, the ability to replenish innovative biopharmaceutical products, healthcare legislation, pipeline
productivity, the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition. We also face challenges as a result of the global economic environment. For additional
information about these factors and challenges, see the “Our Operating Environment” and “The Global Economic Environment” sections of this Financial Review and Part I,
Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 
2017 Form 10-K. The financial information included in our consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the year ended November 30 for each
year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented.

References to operational variances in this Financial Review pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange as well as the negative
currency impact related to Venezuela in 2015. The operational variances are determined by multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the
current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Although
exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control. Exchange rate
 changes, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business;therefore, we believe presenting operational variances provides useful information to evaluate the results of our business.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to
 U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of the TCJA. The TCJA is complex and significantly changesthe U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate
 from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. international taxation from aworldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 
For information on estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 5A . Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from ContinuingOperations.
In October 2017, we announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives for our Consumer Healthcare business. A range of options will be considered, including a full or
partial separation of the Consumer Healthcare business from Pfizer through a spin-off, sale or other transaction, and we may ultimately determine to retain the business.
Our significant business development activities include:
•
On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS, to ICU Medical for up to approximately $900 million , composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. At closing, we received 
3.2 million newly issued shares of ICU Medical common stock, which we initially valued at approximately 
$428 million , a promissory note in the amount of $75 million and net cash of approximately $200 million before customary adjustments for net working capital. In addition, we are entitled to receive a contingent amount of up 
to an additional $225 million in cash based on ICU Medical’s achievement of certain cumulative performance targets for the combined company through December 31, 2019. The operating results of HIS are included in our consolidated statement of
 incomeand EH’s operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for the year ended
 December 31, 2017 reflectapproximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations, while our financial results, and EH’s operating results,
for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect 12 months of HIS global operations and for 
the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect four months of HIS U.S. operations andthree months of HIS international operations. Assets and liabilities associated with HIS are presented as held for sale in the
 consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,2016.
•
On December 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights toAstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S. for 
$1,045 million , composed of cash and contingent consideration. Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of this business, and
, in accordance with our international reportingperiod, our financial results, EH’s operating results, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 
2017 reflect approximately 11 months of the small molecule anti- infectives business acquired from AstraZeneca.
•
On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for $81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ( 
$13.9 billion , net of cash acquired). Of this consideration, approximately $365 million was not paid as of December 31, 2016, and was recorded in Other current liabilities . The remaining consideration was paid as of 
December 31, 2017 . Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Medivation. Therefore, Medivation operations are reflected in our financial results, IH’s operating results, and cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2017. In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect
approximately three months of Medivation operations.
•
On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for $99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion , net of cash acquired), plus 
$698 million debt assumed. Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Anacor. Therefore, Anacor operations are reflected in our financial results, IH’s operating results, and cash flows for the
 year ended December 31, 2017. Inaccordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect approximately six
months of Anacor operations.
•
On April 6, 2016, we announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan entered into on November 22, 2015 was terminated by mutual agreement of thecompanies. The decision was driven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016
, which the companies concluded qualified as an“Adverse Tax Law Change” under the merger agreement. In connection with the termination of the merger agreement, on April 8, 2016 (which fell into Pfizer’s second fiscal
quarter of 2016), Pfizer paid Allergan $150 million (pre-tax) for reimbursement of Allergan’s expenses associated with the terminated transaction (see the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 4 . Other (Income)/Deductions –– Net ). Pfizer and Allergan also released each other from any and all claims in connection withthe merger agreement.
•
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira for approximately $16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Hospira. In accordance with our

Impact of Recent Hurricanes in Puerto Rico
We have manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico, which were impacted by the recent hurricanes toward the end of the third quarter in 2017. While our three
manufacturing sites sustained some damage and became inoperable due to issues impacting Puerto Rico overall, as of the date of this 2017
 Financial Report filing, all threesites have resumed operations and remediation activities continue. Given prior inoperability along with ongoing remediation of our sites, there could be certain product
shortages in the coming months. Our commercial sales offices in Puerto Rico have been operational since October 9, 2017.
In 2017, we recorded 
$195 million in Cost of sales for inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in which the plants could not operate, and  incremental costs to dateresulting from the hurricanes in Puerto Rico. We may record additional losses in future periods but we are unable to predict them with certainty at this time. As a
 result of dualsource supply options and sufficient pre-hurricane inventory levels, we currently expect the impact on future revenues to be insignificant. We will continue to monitor the
situation closely and make any updates to our outlook if warranted.
Product Manufacturing
We periodically encounter difficulties or delays in manufacturing, including due to legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing or voluntary
recall of a product. In February 2017, for example, we received a warning letter from the FDA communicating the FDA’s view that certain violations of current Good
Manufacturing Practice regulations exist at Hospira’s manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas. We are undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the
FDA. In January 2018, the FDA upgraded the status
 of Pfizer’s McPherson, Kansas manufacturing facility to VAI based on an October 2017 inspection. The change to VAIstatus will lift the compliance hold that the FDA placed on approval of pending applications, and is an important step 
toward resolving the issues cited in the February 2017 FDAwarning letter. Within our Essential Health portfolio, we have been experiencing product shortages with some products. The product shortages are primarily for products from
the legacy Hospira portfolio and are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues. Any continued product shortage interruption at this manufacturing facility could
negatively impact our financial results, specifically in our SIP portfolio. In addition to the McPherson facility, we continue to remediate issues at
 other legacy Hospira facilitiesmanufacturing sterile injectables within our Essential Health portfolio. We expect to make substantial progress on our remediation efforts during 2018.
Our 
2017 Performance Revenues–– 
2017 Revenues 
in 2017 decrease d by $278 million , or 1% , compared to 2016 , which reflects a slight net operational decrease of $20 million , or less than 1%, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 
$259 million , or less than 1% .Compared to 2016, total revenues for 2017 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $200 million as a result of 2017 having one less selling day in both U.S. and
international markets.

Our Operating Environment
Industry-Specific Challenges
Intellectual Property Rights 
and Collaboration/Licensing RightsThe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with generic manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights
can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. Many of our branded products have multiple patents
 that expire at varying dates, thereby strengthening our overall patentprotection. However, once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a
 result of a legal challenge, we lose exclusivity on these products, andgeneric pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce similar products and sell them for a lower price. The date at which generic competition commences may be different
from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when generic competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease
our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of time. Also,
 if one of our patents is found to be invalid by judicial, court or administrative proceedings, suchas inter partes 
review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Pa tent Office, or other foreigncounterparts, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of 
the patentsin our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. The invalidation of these patents could
potentially allow a competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace.
As a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva launched a generic version of 
Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017. We lost or expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years, including, among others, 
the expiration of the basic product patent forLyrica in the U.S. in December 2018. Pfizer is currently pursuing a six-month patent-term extension for pediatric exclusivity for Lyrica in the U.S. with the FDA.
For additional information, see the “Recent Losses and Expected Losses of Product Exclusivity” section below.
Our biotechnology products, including BeneFIX, ReFacto, Xyntha, Bavencio,
 Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), may face inthe future, or already face, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing
our biotechnology products, our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions
could follow. For example, Enbrel faces ongoing biosimilar competition in most developed Europe markets, which is expected to continue. The expiration or successful
challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition, assuming any relevant regulatory exclusivity period has expired.
We have lost exclusivity for a number of our products in certain markets and we have lost collaboration rights with respect to a number of our alliance products in certain
markets, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.

  307  312  251 Regulatory Environment/P
ricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group PressuresThe pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be
important to payors, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. We believe that medicines are amongst the
 most powerful tool for patients in curing, treating andpreventing illness and disability, and that all patients should have appropriate access to the medicines their doctors prescribe. We consider a number of factors when
determining a medicine’s price, including, for example, its impact on patients and their disease, other available treatments, the medicine’s potential to reduce other healthcare
costs (such as hospital stays), and affordability. Within the U.S., in particular, we may also engage with pa
tients, doctors and healthcare plans regarding their views. We thennegotiate with insurers, including PBMs and MCOs, often providing significant discounts to them from the initial price. The price that patients pay
 for the medicines theirphysicians prescribe is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. On average, insurers cover a much lower share of prescription drug costs than medical services,
which results in a greater proportion of out-of-pocket costs being passed on to patients for medicines, thereby making them less accessible and af
fordable. We will continue towork with insurance providers, governments and others to improve access to today’s innovative treatments.

Governments, MCOs and other payer groups continue to seek increasing discounts on our products through a variety of means,
 such as leveraging their purchasing power,implementing price controls, and demanding price cuts (directly or by rebate actions). In Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and some other international markets,
governments provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices
or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. In the U.S., government
action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products. Any
significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an
adverse impact on our results of operations. Significant Medicare reductions could also result if Congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the Medicare fee-for-
service program into a premium support program, or Congress chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission,
which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the Medicare program.
Consolidation among MCOs has increased the negotiating power of MCOs and other private insurers. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, increasingly employ
formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement
for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue.
Efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payments for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could
adversely affect our business if implemented. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the
perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs,
 which generally have focused on increasing transparencyaround drug costs or limiting drug prices. Recent legislation enacted includes, for example, a 2017 Maryland law that prohibits a generic drug manufacturer or wholesale
distributor from engaging in price gouging in the sale of certain off-patent or generic drugs, and a 2017 California law that requires manufacturers to provide advanced
notification of price increases to certain purchasers and report specified drug pricing information to the state. Certain state legislation, like the Maryland law, has been subject to
legal challenges.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand 
for, or pricing of, our products. We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective useof healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We will continue to work with law makers and advocate for solutions that e
ffectivelyimprove patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and ensure access to medicines within an efficient and
 affordable healthcare system.We face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA
. The likelihood ofsuch a repeal currently appears low given the failure of the Senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of ACA provisions. In October 2017
, the President signedan Executive Order directing federal agencies to look for ways to authorize more health plans that could be less expensive because the
 plans would not have to meet all of theACA’s coverage requirements, and announced that his administration will withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving low-income
enrollees. In December 2017, the comprehensive tax reform package signed into law, the TCJA (see the “The Global Economic Environment” section below for more
information), includes a provision that effectively repealed the ACA’s individual mandate by removing the penalties. These and similar actions by the administration are widely
expected to lead to fewer Americans having comprehensive ACA-compliant health insurance, even in the absence of a legislative repeal. However, the revenues generated for
Pfizer by the health insurance exchanges under the ACA are minor, so the impact of 
the recent administration actions is expected to be limited. There is no assurance that anyfuture replacement, modification or repeal of the ACA will not adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employer-
sponsored insurance coverage. We also may face uncertainties if our industry is looked to for savings to fund certain legislation, such as lifting the
 debt ceiling. One recentexample is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which increased the discount we pay in 
the Medicare Part D coverage gap from 50% to 70%, which will modestly reduce ourfuture Medicare Part D revenues.
The potential for additional pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continues to be significant. Some employers, seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health
insurance in the ACA to be imposed in 2020, are already scaling back healthcare benefits and an increasing number are implementing high deductible benefit designs. This is a
trend that is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower
reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare
provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review
processes.
Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health
outcomes. Longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward
providers for cost reductions. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to,
 new medicines. At the same time, these models canalso expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and focus on outcomes.
Outside the U.S., governments, including the different EU Member States
, may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including pricecuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a
 country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of othercountries). This international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different
countries, varying health outcomes and some third-party trade in our products between countries.
In particular, international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and can hinder patient access and innovation. Price variations,
exacerbated by international reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The
8
 
 2017 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting
pharmaceuticals in some European countries.
In addition, several important multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are
increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations (e.g., 
2016 UN High Level Panel Report on Access to Medicines and 
2017 OECD Report on New Health Technologies –– Managing Access, Value and Sustainability ). Government adoption of these recommendations may lead to additional pricing pressures.
In response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health 
technology assessment and qualitymeasurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products
. Further,we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by
recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs.
Regulatory Environment––Pipeline
 ProductivityThe discovery and development of safe, effective new products, as well as the development o
f additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength ofour businesses. We have encountered increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy, even as we continue 
to gather safety and other data on our products, beforeand after the products have been launched. Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offse
t revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity, aswell as to provide for earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. These activities involve a high degree of risk and cost and may take many years,
and with respect to any specific R&D project, there can be no assurance that 
the development of any particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product willachieve the desired clinical endpoints and safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially.
During the development of a product, we conduct clinical trials to provide data on the drug’s safety and ef
ficacy to support the evaluation of its overall benefit-risk profile for aparticular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved and launched, we continue 
to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients, and post-marketing trials may be conducted, including trials requested by regulators and trials that we do voluntarily to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the
product, we collect safety data and report potential problems to the FDA and o
ther regulatory authorities. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions may evaluatepotential safety concerns related to a product or a class of products and 
take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product’s labeling, restricting the use of aproduct, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, removing a product from the market.
Competition
Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. For additional
information, see the “Competition” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our 
2017 Form 10-K. The Global Economic Environment
In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, are exposed to 
the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceutical operationsglobally.
•
Governments, corporations, and insurance companies, which provide insurance benefits to patients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on accessto medicines, potentially causing patients to switch to generic or biosimilar products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments.
 Government financingpressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private
health technology assessments), or other means of cost control. Examples include Europe, Japan, China, Canada, 
South Korea and a number of other internationalmarkets. The U.S. continues to maintain competitive insurance markets, but has also seen significant increases in patient cost-sharing and growing government influence as
government programs continue to grow as a source of coverage.
•
We continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several European markets, including Greece, where economicconditions remain challenging and uncertain. For further information about our 
Accounts Receivable , see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review.
•
Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek tomanage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency
assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments
and foreign currency debt. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the U.K. pound
, the Canadian dollarand approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken
against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses
would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained
constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. Therefore,
significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.
The impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including Venezuela, can impact our results
and financial guidance. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $806 million and an inventory impairment charge of $72 million related to
conditions in Venezuela. For further information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” and

In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. In March 2017, the U.K. government formally notified theEuropean Council of its intention to leave the EU after it triggered Article 50 of 
the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exitand outlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. Formal negotiations of
ficially started in June 2017. This process continues to be highly complex and theend result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including the approval
and supply of our products.
We generated approximately 
2% of our worldwide revenues from the U.K. in 2017 . However, except for the foreign currency exchange impact from the weakening U.K. pound relative to the U.S. dollar to date, there are no other immediate-term impacts to our business as there has
 not yet been a formal change in the relationship betweenthe U.K. and the EU. In addition, because
 of the significant uncertainties associated with the negotiation process, any potential long-term impacts are not currentlydeterminable.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of the TCJA. The TCJA is complex and significantlychanges the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, reducing the
 Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. internationaltaxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. Given the significant changes resulting from and complexities associated with the TCJA, the estimated financial impacts for 2017 as well as the estimated
impact on 2018 financial guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income are provisional and subject to further analysis, interpretation and
 clarification of the TCJA,which could result in changes to these estimates during 2018. For additional information, see the “Our Financial Guidance for 
2018 ”, “Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income” and “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this Financial Review and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations.Pfizer maintains a strong financial position while operating in a complex global environment. Due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital
markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the
foreseeable future. Our long-term debt is rated high quality by both S&P and Moody’s. 
As market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. We havetaken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid,
well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. For further discussion of our financial condition and credit ratings, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and
Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review.
These and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors
That May Affect Future Results” section of this Financial Review and in Part I, 
Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 2017 Form 10-K. Our Strategy
We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also 
from a reduction inother healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in
dialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and 
treat disease and improve outcomes. We continue towork within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize patient access
and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that extend and
significantly improve their lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders.
Commercial Operations
We manage our commercial operations through two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). The IH and EH operating
segments are each led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational
products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof-of-concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging
markets.

 2017 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
 
Some additional information about our business segments as of the date of the filing of this 2017 Financial Report follows: 
   
●
IH focuses on developing and commercializing novel, value-creating medicinesand vaccines that significantly improve patients’ lives, as well as products for
consumer healthcare.
Key therapeutic areas include internal medicine, vaccines, oncology, inflammation
& immunology, rare disease and consumer healthcare.
  ●EH includes legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose market exclusivity inboth developed and emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile injectable
products, biosimilars, select branded products including anti-infectives and,
through February 2, 2017, HIS. EH also includes an R&D organization, as well as
our contract manufacturing business.
●
We expect that the IH biopharmaceutical portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained by ongoing
investments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in
areas of focus to help ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates
in areas of unmet medical need. The assets managed by IH are science-driven,
highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with
healthcare providers and consumers.
  ●EH is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patientsaround the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. EH
leverages our biologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to
seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. Additionally, EH leverages
capabilities in formulation development and manufacturing expertise to help
advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio. EH may also engage in targeted
business development to further enable its commercial strategies.
●
IH will have continued focus on R&D productivity and pipeline strength whilemaximizing the value of our recently launched brands and in-line portfolio. Our
acquisitions of Anacor and Medivation expanded our pipeline in the high priority
therapeutic areas of inflammation and immunology and oncology.
 
●For EH, we continue to invest in growth drivers and manage the portfolio to extractadditional value while seeking opportunities for operating efficiencies. This strategy
includes active management of our portfolio; maximizing growth of core product
segments; acquisitions to strengthen core areas of our portfolio further, such as
our recent acquisition of AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business;
and divestitures to increase focus on our core strengths. In line with this strategy,
on February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Pfizer’s global infusion systems net
assets, representing the infusion systems net assets that we acquired as part of
the Hospira transaction, HIS, to ICU Medical.
 
Leading brands include: - 
Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 - 
Xeljanz - 
Eliquis - 
Lyrica  (U.S., Japan and certain other markets) - 
Enbre l (outside the U.S. and Canada) -

Viagra lost exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2017. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada, which were reported in IH throughDecember 2017, will be reported in EH (which reported all other Viagra revenues excluding the U.S. and Canada through 2017). Therefore, total Viagra worldwide revenues
will be reported in EH from 2018 forward.

In January 2018, we announced our decision to end internal neuroscience discovery and early development efforts and re-allocate funding to other areas where we have
stronger scientific leadership. We plan to create a dedicated neuroscience venture fund to support continued efforts
 to advance the field. The development of tanezumab andpotential treatments for rare neuromuscular disorders is not impacted by this decision.
We continue to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline
that will deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&D spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations:
•
Research Units within our WRD organization are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our IH business (assets that have not yetachieved proof-of-concept). Our Research Units are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. Because of our structure,
 we can rapidlyredeploy resources within a Research Unit between various projects as necessary because the workforce shares similar skills, expertise and/or focus.
•
Our R&D organization within the EH business supports the large base of EH products and is expected to develop potential new sterile injectable drugs and therapeuticsolutions, as well as biosimilars.
•
Our GPD organization is a unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products and is generally responsible for the operational execution of clinicaldevelopment of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios. GPD is expected to enable more ef
ficient and effective development and enhance ourability to accelerate and progress assets through our pipeline. GPD combines certain previously separate development-related functions from the IH business and the WRD
organization to achieve a development capability that is expected to deliver high-quality, efficient, and well-executed clinical programs by enabling greater speed, greater
cost efficiencies, and reduced complexity across our development portfolio. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects.
•
Our science-based and other platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our R&D spending occurs, provide technical expertise and other services to thevarious R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our WRD organization), such as Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicinal Chemistry,
Regulatory and Drug Safety, and non-science-based functions, such as Facilities, Business Technology and Finance. As a result,
 within each of these functions, we areable to migrate resources among projects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development, allowing us to react
 quickly in response toevolving needs.
We manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. Specifically, a single committee with representation from the R&D
groups and the IH commercial organization is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRD, GPD and IH R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital
allocation across the Innovative R&D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility. Our EH R&D organization manages its
resources separately from the WRD and GPD organizations.
Generally, we do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do
 not manage a significant portion of ourR&D operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, as
 conditions change, we believethat any prior-period information about R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.
While a significant portion of R&D is done internally, we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third
parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations, alliance and license agreements
with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising
compounds, technologies or capabilities. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of
 the development costs of one of our pipelineproducts in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments, revenue sharing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties. Collaboration, alliance, license
and funding agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost and to access external scientific and 
technological expertise, and enable us toadvance our own products as well as in-licensed or acquired products.

this Financial Review. For additional informationabout our pending new drug applications and supplemental filings, see the “Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income––Product
 Developments––Biopharmaceutical”section of this Financial Review. For additional information about recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe have the potential to
 advance our pipeline, seethe “Our Strategy––Our Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review.
Intellectual Property Rights
We continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen
worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. In addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches
designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and
 we will continue toparticipate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity. Also, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to
challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted. Such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not
be successful. For additional information about our current efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights and certain other patent proceedings, see

We made a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan in February 2018.•
We have also allocated approximately $100 million for a special, one-time bonus to be paid to all non-executive Pfizer colleagues that is expected to be paid in the firstquarter of 2018.
Our Business Development I
nitiativesWe are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of
business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions. We view
our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic
and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. We continue to evaluate business development transactions that have 
the potential to strengthen oneor both of our businesses and their capabilities, such as our acquisitions of Hospira, Medivation, Anacor and AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, as well as
collaborations, and alliance and license agreements with other companies, including our collaborations with Cellectis, OPKO and Merck KGaA. We assess our businesses,
assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance
our businesses. In October 2017, we announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives for our Consumer Healthcare business. A range of options will be considered,
including a full or partial separation of the Consumer Healthcare business from Pfizer through a spin-off, sale or other transaction, and we may ultimately determine to retain the
business. We expect that any decision regarding strategic alternatives for Consumer Healthcare would be made during 2018. For additional information on our business

Note 2. Acquisitions, Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets,  Research and Development andCollaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment 
. The more significant recent transactions and events are described below:
•
Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets to ICU Medical, Inc. (EH) ––On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets,  HIS, to ICUMedical. In connection with this transaction, we recognized pre-tax losses of approximately 
$55 million in 2017 in Other (income)/deductions––net, representing adjustments to amounts previously recorded in 2016 to write down the HIS net assets to fair value less costs
 to sell. We may record additional adjustments to the loss on the sale of HISnet assets in future periods, pending final working capital adjustments, among other agreement provisions, which we do not expect to have a
 material impact on ourconsolidated financial statements.
•
Acquisition of AstraZeneca’s Small Molecule Anti-Infectives Business (EH) ––On December 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S. The total fair value
of the consideration transferred for this business was approximately 
$555 million in cash plus the fair value of contingent consideration of $490 million . •
Acquisition of Medivation, Inc. (IH) ––On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for $81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately 
$14.3 billion in cash ( $13.9 billion , net of cash acquired). Medivation’s portfolio includes Xtandi (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells. Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. Astellas
has exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. In addition, Medivation has a development-stage oncology asset in its pipeline, talazoparib, which is
currently in a Phase 3 study for the treatment of BRCA-mutated breast
 cancer.•
Acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc. (IH) ––On August 1, 2016, we acquired all the remaining equity in Bamboo, a privately-held biotechnology company, focused on developing gene therapies for the potential treatment of patients with certain rare diseases relating to neuromuscular conditions and those affecting 
the central nervoussystem, for 
$150 million , plus potential milestone payments of up to $495 million contingent upon the progression of key assets through development, regulatory approval and commercialization. We previously purchased a minority stake in Bamboo in the first quarter of 2016 for a payment of approximately 
$43 million . This acquisition provides us

with several clinical and pre-clinical assets that complement our rare disease portfolio, an advanced recombinant AAV vector design and production technology, and a fully
functional Phase I/II gene therapy manufacturing facility.
•
Acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IH) ––On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for $99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately 
$4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion net of cash acquired) plus $698 million debt assumed. Anacor’s crisaborole, a non-steroidal topical PDE-4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, was approved by the FDA on December 14, 2016 under the trade name, Eucrisa, for the treatment o
f mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis inpatients two years of age and older, commonly referred to as a type of eczema. 
Anacor also holds the rights to Kerydin, a topical treatment for onychomycosis (toenailfungus) that is distributed and commercialized by Sandoz 
in the U.S. •
Research and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund II, L.P. ––On November 1, 2016, we announced the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for bococizumab. During December 2016, 
$31.3 million was refunded to NovaQuest representing amounts NovaQuest prepaid for development costs (under the May 2016 agreement described below) that were not used for program expenses due to the discontinuation of the development program. No additional payments
have been or are expected to be received from or paid to NovaQuest under this agreement, which was effec
tively terminated on November 18, 2016.In May 2016, our agreement with NovaQuest became effective, under which NovaQuest agreed to 
fund up to $250 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s bococizumab compound and Pfizer agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound.
NovaQuest’s development funding was expected to cover up to 
40% of the development costs and was to be received over five quarters during 2016 and 2017. As there wasa substantive and genuine transfer of risk to NovaQuest, the development 
funding applicable to program expenses during 2016 was recognized as an obligation to performcontractual services and therefore has been recognized as a reduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses 
for 2016 totaled $180.3 million . •
Research and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund V, L.P. ––In April 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with NovaQuest under which NovaQuest will fund up to $200 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s rivipansel compound and Pfizer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound. NovaQuest’s development funding is expected to cover up
 to 100% of the developmentcosts and will be received over approximately 12 quarters from 2016 to 2019. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of
 risk to NovaQuest, the development funding isrecognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is a reduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses 
totaled $72.1 million for 2017 and $46.6 million for 2016. Following potential regulatory approval, NovaQuest will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to approximately 
$267 million in total, based on achievement of first commercial sale and certain levels of cumulative net sales as well as royalties on rivipansel net sales over approximately eight years. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized
to 
Amortization of intangible assets over the estimated commercial life of the rivipansel product and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred. •
Research and Development Arrangement with RPI Finance Trust ––In January 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with RPI, a subsidiary of Royalty Pharma, under which RPI will fund up to 
$300 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s Ibrance (palbociclib) product primarily for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive early breast cancer (the Indication). RPI’s development funding is expected to cover up to 100% of 
the costs primarily for the applicable clinicaltrials through 2021. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to RP
I, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractualservices and therefore is a reduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses totaled $75.6 million for 2017 and 
$44.9 million for 2016. If successful and upon approval of Ibrance in the U. S. or certain major markets in the EU for the Indication based on the applicable clinicaltrials, RPI will be eligible to receive a combination of approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $250 million dependent upon results of the clinical trials and royalties
on certain Ibrance sales over approximately seven years. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets 
over the estimated commercial life of the Ibrance product and sales-based royalties will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred. •
Acquisition of Hospira (EH) ––On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). •
Acquisition of a Minority Interest in AM-Pharma B.V. (IH) ––In April 2015, we acquired a minority equity interest in AM-Pharma, a privately-held Dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of recAP for inflammatory diseases, and secured an exclusive option to acquire the
 remaining equity in the company. The optionbecomes exercisable after completion of a Phase II trial of recAP in the treatment
 of Acute Kidney Injury related to sepsis, which is currently expected in the first quarter of2018. Under the terms of the agreement, we originally paid 
$87.5 million for both the exclusive option and the minority equity interest, which was recorded as a cost-method investment in 
Long-term investments. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a loss of $43 million for an impairment of our long-term investment. •
Collaboration with OPKO Health, Inc. ––We entered into a collaborative agreement with OPKO, which closed in January 2015, to develop and commercialize OPKO’s long- acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of GHD in adults and children, as well as for the treatment
 of growth failure in children born SGA who fail to show catch-up growth by twoyears of age. hGH-CTP has the potential to reduce the required dosing frequency of human growth hormone to
 a single weekly injection from the current standard of oneinjection per day. We have received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide. OPKO will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the
development programs for the key indications, which include Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. We will be responsible for all development costs for additional
indications, all postmarketing studies, manufacturing and commercialization activities for all indications, and we will lead the manufacturing activities related to product
development. In February 2015, we made an upfront payment of 
$295 million to OPKO, which was recorded in Research and development expenses, and OPKO is eligible to receive up to an additional 
$275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OPKO is also eligible to receive royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD, which is subject to regulatory
approval, the royalties will transition to tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and our product, Genotropin.

Acquisition of Marketed Vaccines Business of Baxter International Inc. (IH) ––On December 1, 2014 (which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 for our international operations), we acquired Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines for a final purchase price of 
$648 million . The portfolio that was acquired consists of NeisVac-C and FSME- IMMUN/TicoVac. NeisVac-C is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group C meningococcal meningitis and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac is a vaccine that
helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis.
•
Collaboration with Merck KGaA (IH) ––In November 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, the proposed international non-proprietary name for the investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody (MSB0010718C), currently approved as Bavencio for metastatic MCC and for
patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC in certain countries and in development as a potential treatment for multiple other types of cancer. Under the
 terms of theagreement, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we made an upfront payment o
f $850 million to Merck KGaA and Merck KGaA is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately 
$2.0 billion . As of December 31, 2017, we made $140 million in milestone payments to Merck KGaA for approvals of avelumab received in 2017 for the MCC indication in the U.S., the EU and Japan, and 
for the metastatic UC indication in the U.S. Both companies jointly fund all development andcommercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 products from this collaboration. Also, as part of the agreement, we
gave Merck KGaA certain co-promotion rights for Xalkori in the U.S. and several other key markets.
•
Collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company ––In 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize Pfizer ’ s tanezumab,which provides that Pfizer and Lilly will equally share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. Following the decision
by the FDA in March 2015 to lift the partial clinical hold on the tanezumab development program, we received a $200 million upfront payment from Lilly in accordance with the
collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Lilly, which is recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions 
–– net over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Pfizer and Lilly resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab inJuly 2015. The FDA granted Fast Track designation for tanezumab for the treatment
 of chronic pain in patients with OA and CLBP in June 2017. Under the collaborationagreement with Lilly, we are eligible to receive additional payments from Lilly upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones.
Our Financial Guidance for 
2018 The following table provides our financial guidance for full-year 2018 
(a), (b) :Revenues
$53.5 to $55.5 billion Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues
20.5% to 21.5% Adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses
$14.0 to $15.0 billion Adjusted research and development expenses
$7.4 to $7.9 billion Adjusted other (income)/deductions
Approximately $400 million of income Effective tax rate on adjusted income
Approximately 17.0% Adjusted diluted EPS
$2.90 to $3.00 (a) 
 The 2018 financial guidance reflects the following:•
A full year contribution from Consumer Healthcare. Pfizer continues to expect that any decision regarding strategic alternatives for Consumer Healthcare would be made during 2018.•
Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of December 31, 2017 , including any one-time upfr ont payments associated with such transactions.•
Exchange rates assumed are as of mid-January 2018.•
Reflects an anticipated negative revenue impact of $2.0 billion due to recent and expect ed generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patentprotection. Assumes no generic c
ompetition for Lyrica in the U.S. until June 2019, which is contingent upon a six-month patent-term extension granted by the FDA for pediatric exclusivity, which the company iscurrently pursuing.
•
Reflects the anticipated favorable impact of $900 million on revenues and $0.06 on adjusted diluted EPS as a result of favorable chan ges in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to foreignexchange rates from 2017.
•
Guidance for the effective tax rate on Adjusted income reflects our provisional estimate of the impact of the TCJA.•
Guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 6.0 billion shares, which reflects anti cipated share repurchases totaling $5.0 billion in 2018 . Dilution related to share-based em
ployee compensation programs is expected to offset by approximately half the reduction in shares associated with these anticipated share repurchases.(b)

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND
ASSUMPTIONS
For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies . Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and 
themost complex judgments: (i) Acquisitions (Note 1D); (ii) Fair Value (Note 1E); (iii) Revenues (Note 1G); (iv) Asset Impairments (Note 1K); (v) Income Tax Assets and Liabilities
and 
Income Tax Contingencies (Note 1O); (vi) Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans (Note 1P); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies (Note 1Q).Following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. See also Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements–– 
Note 1C. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Estimates and  Assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions.
Acquisitions and Fair Value
For a discussion about the application of fair value to our recent acquisitions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 2A. Acquisitions, Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment:
 Acquisitions.For a discussion about the application of fair value to our investments, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7A. Fair Value Measurements . For a discussion about the application of fair value to our benefit plan assets, see Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 11D. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans: Plan Assets 
. For a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews, see “Asset Impairment Reviews” below.
Revenues
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the
 same period that the revenues are recognized, and primarilyrepresent chargebacks, rebates and sales allowances to wholesalers, and, to a lesser extent, distributors like MCOs, retailers and government agencies with respect to our
pharmaceutical products. Those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for the reporting period and, as
 such, knowledge and judgmentof market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not
 been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, ouradjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues,
 and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends. 
If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by
 program, typeof customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material
adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate se
ttlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because ofthis time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.
Asset Impairment Reviews
We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements–– 
Note 1K. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets.Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rightswould likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.
•
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. For example, restrictions imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities could affect ourability to manufacture or sell a product.
•
A projection or forecast that indicates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursementprogram that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in
a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of
 a product by patients, physiciansand payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based
 on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additionalexpenditures to commercialize the product.

Identifiable Intangible Assets
As a result of our identifiable intangible asset impairment review work, we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets for the years ended
December 31, 2017 
, 2016 and 2015 . See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions — Net.When we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. We s
tartwith a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the
 asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply anasset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of 
the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount andtiming of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on 
the projections and the impact of technological riskassociated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount
 rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows;and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash 
flows.While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, in general, intangible assets other than goodwill that are most at
risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately 
$5.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 ) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, as R&D is an inherently risky activity. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets
are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each
 reporting period. As such, immediately afteracquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment
charge.
Goodwill
As a result of our goodwill impairment review work, we concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired as of 
December 31, 2017 , and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.
We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the 
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that weconsider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then
 perform a quantitative fair value test.When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, as appropriate for the individual reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but we may also use
the market approach, or a weighted-average combination of both approaches.
•
The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, the method that we use isthe discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of
 all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminalvalue, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. 
Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent inthis approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected
 impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/orregulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks 
to reflect the various risks inherent in the projectedcash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the
 projected cash flows.•
The market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. Within the market approach are two methods that we mayuse:
◦
Guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similarlines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and the
 application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’sfinancial performance.
◦
Guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar linesof business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.
The market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued;
however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: 
theselection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership
percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.
For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors tha
t may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome ofsubsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affec
t Future Results” section of this FinancialReview and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 
2017 Form 10-K. Benefit Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both IRC-qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for
retirees and their eligible dependents.
The accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and calculations, which can result from a complex series of judgments about fu
tureevents and uncertainties. The assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the net employee

benefit obligations for the defined benefit and postretirement plans include the discount rate; expected
 salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover,retirement age and mortality (life expectancy); expected return on plan assets; and healthcare cost trend rates.
Effective January 1, 2018, accruals for future benefits under the
 Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan (our largest U.S. defined benefit plan) and the defined benefit section of thePfizer Group Pension Scheme (our largest pension plan in the U.K.) were frozen and will result in elimination of future service costs for the plan. The P
fizer defined contributionsavings plan will provide additional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan and active members of the Pfizer
Group Pension Scheme will start accruing benefits under the defined contribution section of that plan.
As of 
December 31, 2017 , the noncurrent portion of our pension benefit obligations, net, and our postretirement benefit  obligations, net decreased, in the aggregate, byapproximately 
$742 million compared to December 31, 2016 . The decrease reflects, among other things, the $1.0 billion voluntary pension contribution we made in January 2017 and an increase in actual returns on plan assets, partially offset by the impact of
 a decrease in the discount rate used in the measurement of plan obligations.Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made
in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.
The following table provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on
 plan assets for the following year, (ii) the actual annual rate of return on planassets achieved in each year, and (iii) the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at the end o

Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets
The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect
 our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-lookingreturn expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our 
targeted asset allocation in ourrespective plans.
The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and
 the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end andthe resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year. In February 2018, Pfizer made a voluntary con
tribution of $500 million to the U.S. qualifiedpension plans. In 2018, this contribution was included in the plan asset balance for purposes of determining the expected
 return on plan assets.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the
 expected annual rate of return on plan assets,holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):
 
  Change  Increase in 2018 Net PeriodicBenefit Costs
Assumption
      Expected annual rate of return on plan assets
  50 basis point decline  $110 The actual return on plan assets resulted in a net gain on our plan assets of approximately 
$2.9 billion during 2017 . Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations
The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated
 and modified, asrequired, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or be
tter, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefitscould be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least
 annually by reference to investment gradecorporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient da
ta, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of localrequirements.
The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect 
the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefitcosts in the following year.

December 31, 2017 resulted in an increase in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately 
$1.3 billion . Income Tax Assets and Liabilities
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an estimate of certain 
tax effects of the TCJA, including the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities from the reduction in thecorporate tax rate from 35% to 
21% , the impact on valuation allowances and other state income tax considerations, a repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings for which we plan to elect payment over eight years through 2026 that is reported in 
Other taxes payable , and deferred taxes on basis differences expected to give rise to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, we had provided deferred tax liabilities in the past on foreign earnings that were not indefinitely
reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we reversed an estimate of 
the deferred taxes that are no longer expected to be needed due to the change to the territorial tax system. Theestimated amounts recorded may change in the future due to uncertain tax positions.
The
 TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5,Accounting
 for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ,  states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basisdifferences
 expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. Wehave
 elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years. However, given the complexity ofthese provisions, we have not finalized our analysis. We were able to make
 a reasonable estimate of the deferred taxes on the temporary differences expected to reverse in thefuture and
 provided a provisional deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017. The provisional amount is based on the evaluation of certain temporary differences inside eachof
 our foreign subsidiaries that are expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income. However, as we continue to evaluate the TCJA’s global intangible low-taxedincome provisions during the measurement period, we may revise the methodology used for determining the deferred tax liability associated with such income.
We believe that we have made reasonable estimates with respect to each of the above items,
 however, all of the amounts recorded are provisional as we have not completedour analysis of the complex and far reaching effects of the TCJA. Further,
 we continue to consider our assertions on any remaining outside basis differences in our foreignsubsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and have not completed our analysis. Under guidance issued by the staff of 
the SEC, we expect to finalize our accounting related to thetax effects of the TCJA on deferred taxes
, valuation allowances, state tax considerations, the repatriation tax liability, global intangible low-taxed income, and any remainingoutside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries during 2018 as we complete our analysis, computations and assertions. We will revise these estimates during 2018 as we
gather additional information to complete our tax returns and as any interpretation or clarification of the TCJA occurs through legislation, U.S. Treasury actions or other means.
Income tax assets and liabilities also include Income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated

Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.Revenues—Overview
Compared to 2016, total revenues for 2017 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $200 million as a result of 2017 having one less selling day in both U.S. and
international markets.
Total revenues in 
2017 compared to 2016 reflect a slight operational decrease of $20 million , or less than 1%, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $259 million , or less than 
1% , in 2017 , compared to 2016 . Compared to 2015, international revenues for 2016 were favorably impacted by approximately $100 million as a result of 2016 having one more selling day in international
markets. In the U.S., there was no difference in selling days in 2016, compared to
 2015.Total revenues in 
2016 compared to 2015 reflect an operational increase of $5.5 billion , or 11% , partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.5 billion , or 3% 
, in 2016 compared to 2015 . See the “Revenues by Segment and Geography” and “Revenues—Major Products” sections of this Financial Report for additional analyses.
See the “Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights” section of this Financial Report for information about (i) recent losses and expected losses of product
exclusivity impacting product revenues and (ii) recent losses of collaboration rights impacting alliance revenues.
In addition, we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years. For additional information, see

We have significant operations outside the U.S., with revenues exceeding $500 million in the following number of countries:
By total revenues, the U.S., Japan and China are our three largest na
tional markets:
Inventory Stocking
Our policy relating to the supply of pharmaceutical inventory at domestic wholesalers, and in major international markets, is to generally maintain stocking levels under one
month on average and to keep monthly levels consistent from year to year based on patterns o
f utilization. We historically have been able to closely monitor these customerstocking levels by purchasing information from our customers directly or by obtaining other third-party information. We believe our data sources to be directionally reliable but
cannot verify their accuracy. Further, as we do not control this third-party data, we cannot be
 assured of continuing access. Unusual buying patterns and utilization are promptlyinvestigated.
Revenue Deductions
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period tha
t the revenues are recognized, and primarilyrepresent chargebacks, rebates and sales allowances to wholesalers, and, to a lesser extent, distributors like MCOs, retailers and government agencies with respect to our
pharmaceutical products. Those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for the reporting period and, as
 such, knowledge and judgmentof market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not
 been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, ouradjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues,
 and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends. 
If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by
 program, typeof customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material
adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate se
ttlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because ofthis time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.

(e)  $19,126  $16,895  $15,014 (a) 
 Rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year are impacted by the mix of products sold.(b)
 
Performance-based contract rebates include contract rebates with managed care customers within the U.S., including health maintenance organizations and PBMs, who receive rebates based on the achievementof contracted performance terms 
and claims under these contracts. Outside the U.S., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contractedperformance for specific products 
or sales milestones.(c) 
 Chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) 
 Sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the U.S., discounts and distribution fees.(e)
 
For 2017 , associated with the following se gments: IH ( $9.0 billion ); and EH ( $10.1 billion ). For 2016 , associated with the following se gments: IH ( $7.1 billion ); and EH ( $9.8 billion ). For 2015 , associated with the following segments: IH ( 
$5.8 billion ); and EH ( $9.2 billion ). Total revenue deductions for 
2017 increase d 13% compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of: •
an increase in performance-based contract rebates primarily due to increased sales of certain IH products to managed care customers in the U.S., and certain IH and EHproducts in developed Europe;
•
an increase in sales allowances as a result of sales growth, primarily in emerging markets;•
an increase in Medicaid and related state program rebates, primarily as a result of increased sales of both IH and EH products through these programs;•
higher chargebacks resulting from increased sales through U.S. wholesalers of certain IH products, partially offset by decreases in sterile injectable sales; and•
an increase in Medicare rebates driven by increased sales of IH products through this channel, offset by certain EH products which have recently lost exclusivity.For information on our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and
sales returns and cash discounts, including the balance sheet classification of these accruals, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

primarily in the U.S.)
  1,608  1,104  503 Ibrance global growth: U.S. revenues increased primarily due to continued strong uptake in the metastatic
breast cancer setting. International revenues increased operationally, but were negatively impacted by a
one-time price adjustment to 2017 revenues related to finalizing reimbursement agreements in certain
developed Europe markets.

  (359 ) (359 ) — Decline from the Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals portfolio, primarily due to legacy Hospira product
shortages in the U.S.
  (315 ) (460 ) 145 Decline in the Legacy Established Products portfolio primarily due to generic competition in developed
markets
  (188 ) (419 ) 231 Decline in Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues. U.S. revenues decreased primarily due to the expected decline
in revenues for the adult indication in the U.S. due to a high initial capture rate of
 the eligible populationfollowing its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up”
opportunity compared to 2016, partially offset by growth from the pediatric indication. International revenues
increased primarily due to the favorable overall impact of timing and increased volume associated with
government purchases in certain emerging markets for the pediatric indication compared with prior year, as
well as from the inclusion of Prevenar 13 in additional national immunization programs in certain emerging
markets for the adult and pediatric indications in the fourth of quarter 2017.

Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (IH) worldwide revenues decrease d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . Foreign exchange had a de minimis impact on worldwide revenues in 
2017 , compared to 2016 . In the U.S., revenues for Prevnar 13 
decrease d 9% in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to the expected decline in revenues for the adult indication in the U.S. due to a high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity (i.e., the
opportunity to reach adults age 65 and older who have not been previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13) compared to prior year, partially offset by growth from the
 pediatricindication. We expect revenues

from the adult indication in the U.S. to be flat to
 declining as the remaining cohort of adults 65 years and over is much more difficult to capture.Internationally, revenues for Prevenar 13 
increase d 10% operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to the favorable overall impact of timing and increased volume associated with government purchases in certain emerging markets for the pediatric indication compared with prior year, as well as from the inclusion of Prevenar
13 in additional national immunization programs in certain emerging markets for the adult and pediatric indications in the fourth of quarter 2017. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable 
impact of 1% on international revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . In 2014, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 13 for routine use
 to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which for adults includespneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. These ACIP recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the
 CDC andU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in September 2014 by the CDC. As with other vaccines,
the CDC regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations; in this case, however, the CDC announced formally that it will conduct this review
in 2018, which commenced at a meeting in February 2018. A potential adverse change in the ACIP recommendation could negatively impact future 
Prevnar 13 revenues.Currently, we are working with a number of U.S. investigators to monitor the proportion of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes included in Prevnar 13
and continue to observe trends.

Lyrica (EH (revenues from all of Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia)/IH (revenues from all other geographies)) worldwide revenues increase d operationally in 2017 
, compared to 2016 . Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . In the U.S., Lyrica revenues 
increase d 10% in 2017 , compared to 2016 , driven by sustained demand and positive price impact. Internationally, Lyrica revenues 
decrease d 11% operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to losses of exclusivity in developed Europe markets. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact of 1% on international revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . Lyrica revenues in our IH segment 
increase d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily driven by sustained demand and positive price impact in the U.S. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . In our EH segment, worldwide revenues from Lyrica 
decrease d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , due to losses of exclusivity in developed Europe markets. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . •
Ibrance (IH) worldwide revenues, most of which were recorded in the U.S., increase d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . The significant revenue growth reflects Ibrance class leadership among cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in major markets with continuous share uptake in the U.S. and launches in major international markets
supported by our scientific/clinical data and continued positive patient experience. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 2017 , compared to 
2016 . International revenues 
increase d over 100% operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , but were negatively impacted by a one-time price adjustment to 2017 revenues in certain developed Europe markets related to finalizing reimbursement agreements in these markets. These agreements establish pricing levels comparable to European
pricing analogues for oncology products, ensure patient access and are expected to drive future growth in these markets. Despite 
the one-time impact, underlying Ibrancevolumes in developed Europe increased.
•
Enbrel (IH, outside the U.S. and Canada) worldwide revenues, excluding the U.S. and Canada, decrease d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to ongoing biosimilar competition in most developed Europe markets, which is expected to continue. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 2017

2016 . In the U.S., revenues decrease d 2% in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by favorable rebates. In our international markets, revenues 
increase d 12% operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , driven by increased demand in China, partially offset by pricing pressures in China and Europe. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact of 2% on international revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . •
Xeljanz (IH) worldwide revenues increase d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . In the U.S., Xeljanz revenues increase d 41% in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily driven by increased adoption among rheumatologists, growing awareness among patients and improvements in payer access. In our international markets, revenues
increase 
d 76% operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily driven by continued uptake in Japan, Canada and certain emerging markets and, to a lesser extent, the impact of new launches in certain developed Europe markets. Foreign exchange had 
a de minimis impact on worldwide revenues and an unfavorable impact of 1% oninternational revenues in 
2017 , compared to 2016 . •
Viagra (IH (U.S. and Canada revenues)/EH (all other revenues excluding U.S. and Canada)) worldwide revenues decrease d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . The worldwide 
decrease in 2017 , compared to 2016 , was primarily due to a 31% decrease in the U.S. driven by generic competition that began in December 2017. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . International revenues 
increase d 2% operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily from increased demand in emerging markets, mainly China and certain Middle Eastern markets, partially offset by price reductions in China. Foreign exchange had

increase d 24% in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to increased promotional activities , educating healthcare providers on updates to the Chantix label, including removal of the boxed warning, the addition of EAGLES safe
ty and efficacy data, improved patient access and positive price impact.•
The Premarin family of products (EH) worldwide revenues decrease d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . Foreign exchange had a de minimis impact on worldwide revenues in 
2017 , compared to 2016 . Revenues in the U.S. decrease d 4% in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily driven by lower volume, partially offset by a positive price impact.
Internationally, Premarin revenues 
decrease d 9% operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by price increases. Foreign exchange had 
a favorable impact of 2% on international revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . •
Norvasc (EH) worldwide revenues decrease d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . The decrease was primarily driven by generic competition in Japan, pricing pressures in China and lower volumes in certain Middle Eastern markets, partially offset by increased demand in China. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 
2017 , compared to 2016 . •
Celebrex (EH) worldwide revenues increase d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . The increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing in the U.S. and volume growth in emerging markets, primarily China, partially offset by generic competition in the U.S. and pricing pressures in Mexico. Foreign exchange had 
an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in 
2017 , compared to 2016 . •
Xalkori (IH) worldwide revenues increase d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , as a result of a steady increase in diagnostic rates for the AL K gene mutation acrosskey markets outside the U.S., which has led to more patients being treated as
 well as increased use in first line indication. This increase was partially offset by volumedeclines in the U.S. and Japan due to competitive pressure, partially mitigated by the March 2016 FDA approval of the
 supplemental NDA to treat patients with metastaticNSCLC whose tumors are ROS1-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test. Foreign exchange had 
a de minimis impact on worldwide revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 
. •
Inflectra/Remsima (EH) worldwide revenues increase d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 . The increase was due to the U.S. launch in the fourth quarter of  2016and continued uptake in developed markets in Europe, partially offset by pricing pressures in developed Europe markets. Foreign exchange had 
a favorable impact on worldwide revenues in 
2017 , compared to 2016 . Inflectra uptake in the U.S. is being driven by a number of factors including Inflectra’s clinical data package, pa
tient support programs, price and the access/reimbursementenvironment. To date, reimbursement coverage has been mixed. While we achieved 100% Medicare coverage, we have experienced access challenges among commercial
payers where our lower priced product has not received access at parity to the innovator product and remains in a disadvantaged position despite the higher price of
innovator product. We will look at all relevant factors impacting reimbursement given our extensive experience working with commercial payers to enable greater access for
Inflectra. Additionally, in September 2017, Pfizer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for 
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against J&J alleging that J&J’s exclusionarycontracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning Remicade® (infliximab) violate federal antitrust laws.

Eucrisa (IH) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis for patients  two years of age and older. The FDA approved Eucrisa on December14, 2016, and Eucrisa was launched in the U.S. late in the 
first quarter of 2017 . Eucrisa is a non-steroidal topical ointment and is the first topical prescription treatment for atopic dermatitis approved in over 10 years. Prescription volume continued to strengthen steadily throughout 2017 supported by the launch of
 our direct-to-consumercampaign in the third quarter of 2017.
•
Alliance revenues (IH/EH) increase d operationally in 2017 , compared to 2016 , mainly due to: ◦
an increase in Eliquis alliance revenues due to higher demand resulting from increased market penetration of novel oral anticoagulants and market share gains; and◦
an increase in Xtandi alliance revenues of $450 million in the U.S. resulting from the September 2016 acquisition of Medivation. While 2017 revenue growth did not reflect volume growth due to higher demand through patient assistance programs (which provide free medicines to patients), we believe that the demand for patient assistance
as a percentage of total demand will decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017.
Foreign exchange had 
a de minimis impact on worldwide alliance revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 . ◦
Eliquis (IH) has been jointly developed and is commercialized by Pfizer and BMS. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study.Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a
percentage of net sales. We have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage
 of the net sales toend-customers in these markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC) market; the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment
 optionsto warfarin in appropriate patients.

tial manufacturing site in the BLA for the proposed epoetin alfa biosimilar. In November 2017, Pfizerresubmitted the BLA to the FDA for Retacrit in response
 to the “complete response” letter. In January 2018, the FDA upgraded the status of Pfizer’s McPherson, Kansas manufacturing facilityto VAI based on an October 2017 inspection. The change to
 VAI status will lift the compliance hold that the FDA placed on approval of Pfizer pending applications, and will permit review of theBLA for the proposed epoetin alfa biosimilar.

In May 2012, the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogateendpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. In June 2012, 
the FDA issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis NDA. The FDA has requested thecompletion of a second efficacy study, and also has asked 
for additional information on the data within the current tafamidis NDA. Pfizer initiated study B3461028 in December 2013, a globalPhase 3 study to support a potential new indication in transthyre
tin cardiomyopathy, which includes transthyretin familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (TTR-FAC) and wild-type cardiomyopathy(WT-CM). We anticipate results from this s
tudy in 2018, and continue to work with the FDA to identify next steps.2017 Financial Report

COSTS AND EXPENSES
The changes in expenses below for 2017 v. 2016 reflect, among other things, the
 favorable impact of the February 2017 sale of HIS. The operating results of HIS are includedin our operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, operating results for 
2017 include approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations, while operating results for 
2016 reflect 12 months of HIS global operations. The changes in expenses below for 2016 v. 2015 reflect, among other things, the
 unfavorable impact of the September 2015 acquisition of Hospira; specifically, the inclusion ofa full year of legacy Hospira global operations in 2016, compared to the inclusion of four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months o
f legacy Hospirainternational operations in 2015.

Revenues   21.4 % 23.3 % 19.7 %   2017 
v. 2016Cost of sales 
decreased 9% in 2017 , compared to 2016 , primarily due to: •
the favorable impact of the sale of HIS global operations (which carried a higher cost of sales than other products) of $561 million;•
recognition of synergies related to our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•
the nonrecurring unfavorable impact of $248 million of acquired Hospira inventory, which is measured at fair value on the acquisition date and was amortized over the turnof the related inventory;
•
the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $140 million and the favorable offset of hedging gains of $52 million ; and •
a favorable change in product mix, including an operational decline in the SIP portfolio and the favorability attributed to products that have lost exclusivity,partially offset by:
•
$195 million in inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in which our Puerto Rico plants were not operational, and incremental costs to date,  all of whichresulted from the recent hurricanes in Puerto Rico.
The 
decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2017 , compared to 2016 , was primarily due to all of the factors discussed above, as well as an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales.
2016 
v. 2015Cost of sales 
increased 28% in 2016 , compared to 2015 , primarily due to: •
the unfavorable impact of the Hospira acquisition;•
the growth in revenues from key innovative brands as well as the growth in the legacy Pfizer Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals portfolio;•
production variances driven by changes in product mix, including products which have lost exclusivity and manufacturing production issues at certain sites (upapproximately $300 million);
•
an increase in costs associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives including plant network strategy (approximately $200 million); and•
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3% or approximately $410 million in 2016 . The increase in 
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues in 2016 , compared to 2015 , was primarily due to: •
an unfavorable change in product mix due to (i) the unfavorable impact of the Hospira acquisition, with products that carry a higher cost, as well as the impact of acquiredHospira inventory which was measured at fair value on the acquisition date and amortized over the turn of the related inventory; and (ii) the impact of losses of
 exclusivity onproducts which formerly had a higher gross margin;
•
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange; and•
the unfavorable impact of costs incurred to implement our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives (not related to acquisitions) in 2016, compared to 2015,partially offset by:
•
a favorable change in product mix related to legacy Pfizer products, excluding the impact of losses of exclusivity on products referred to above; and•
non-recurring charges of $72 million related to manufacturing plant pension obligations and non-recurring charges of $72 million related to inventory impairment inVenezuela in 2015 related to the foreign currency change described in the “Global Economic Conditions—Venezuela Operations” section in this Financial Review.

Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.In connection with our acquisition of Hospira, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We
 expect to achieve $1 billion of annual cost savings by 2018 in connection with the Hospira acquisition, 25% more than our initial cost savings target of 
$800 million , and have achieved approximately $720 million 
of cost savings through December 31, 2017. The one-time costs to generate the  savings are expected to be approximately $1 billion (not including costs of $215 million for full-year 2015 associated with the return of acquired IPR&D rights), and the majority of these costs are expec
ted to be incurred for the three-year period post-acquisition.36
 
 2017 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
In 2016, we substantially completed previously disclosed cost-reduction initiatives begun in 2014 associated with our global commercial structure reorganization, manufacturing
plant network rationalization and optimization initiatives, and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives across the enterprise. Through December 31, 2016, we incurred
$3.1 billion 
(pre-tax) in total costs for the 2014-2016 program. The cumulative ongoing annual cost savings associated with the 2014-2016 program (but not including expected cost savings associated with the Hospira acquisition), are approximately $3.1 billion. These savings were recognized, for the most part, through the end of 2016.
 However,savings from costs incurred in the last half of 2016 largely occurred in 2017.
New Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
— 2017 through 2019 ActivitiesAs a result of the evaluation performed in connection with our decision in September 2016 to not pursue, a
t that time, splitting IH and EH into two separate publicly-tradedcompanies, we have identified new opportunities to potentially achieve greater optimization and efficiency to become more competitive in our business. Therefore, we have
initiated new enterprise-wide cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, which we expect to complete by the end of 2019. These initiatives will encompass all areas of our cost base
and will include further centralization of our corporate and platform functions and optimization of our manufacturing plant network to support IH and EH products and pipelines,
as well as activities in other areas where opportunities are identified. The action plans related to these new initiatives are underway and, in order to achieve targeted savings of
approximately 
$1.4 billion by 2020, we expect to incur total costs of approximately $1.1 billion over the three year period, 2017-2019. Of this amount, we expect about 80% to be manufacturing operations related and we expect about 
20% of the total charges will be non-cash. For additional information about these programs and expected and actual total costs, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
. The expected cost savings in 2018 associated with these activities are reflected in our 2018 financial guidance.In addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity
and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.

. 2017 
v. 2016The 
lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of: •
the tax benefits associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities, which includes the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings offoreign subsidiaries associated with the enactment of the TCJA; and
•
a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business,partially offset by:
•
the decrease in benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities and the expiration ofcertain statutes of limitations; and
•
the non-recurrence of benefits related to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve certain claimsrelated to Protonix, which resulted in the receipt of information that raised our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax

the benefits related to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve certain claims related to Protonix,which resulted in the receipt of information that raised our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position;
•
the non-recurrence of the non-deductibility of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela;•
the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business;•
the increase in benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration ofcertain statutes of limitations; and
•
the benefits related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, as of January 1, 2016, requiring excess tax benefits or deficiencies of share-based compensation to be recognized as a component of the 
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income . The net tax benefit was $89 million in 2016 (See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in Pfizer’s 2016 Financial Report),
partially offset by:
•
the non-recurrence of tax benefits associated with certain tax initiatives.Changes in Tax Laws
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to
 U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of the TCJA. The TCJA is complex and significantly changesthe U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate
 from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. international taxation from aworldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 
Given the significant changes resulting from and complexities associated with the TCJA, the estimated financial impacts for 2017 as well as the estimated impact on 2018 
financialguidance for the effective tax rate on Adjusted income are provisional and subject to further analysis, interpretation and
 clarification of the TCJA, which could result in changesto these estimates during 2018. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations 
and the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources––Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations” section of this Financial Report.
On January 23, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act
 No. 3-2017, amending Section 2101 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, which imposesan excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (Act 154). The excise 
tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and their affiliates from theirPuerto Rico affiliates. As originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in effec
t from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in 2011 to 1% in 2016.Act No. 2-2013 extended the excise tax through 2017 and,
 effective July 1, 2013, increased the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. Act No. 3-2017 further extended theexcise tax for all years through 2027 at a rate of 4%. The excise 
tax has been recorded in Cost of sales and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, as appropriate. All expected impacts in 2018 have been reflected in our financial guidance for 2018.
On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the
 2015 Act) was signed into law and generally provides for the temporary or permanentextension, retroactive to January 1, 2015, of certain tax benefits
 and credits that had expired, including the U.S. R&D tax credit, which was extended permanently. Given theenactment date of the 2015 Act, 
the benefit related to our 2015 R&D spending was recorded in 2015.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (ADJUSTED INCOME)
General Description of Non-GA
AP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income)Adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management. We measure the performance of the overall Company on this basis in conjunction with other
performance metrics. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by
disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share in order to portray the
results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare (OTC) products––
prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined Adjusted income as 
Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. Similarly, we have defined the Adjusted income
components as 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and Other(income)/deductions––net 
each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. We have defined Adjusted diluted earnings per share as 
Earnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc.––diluted before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. The Adjusted income measure, the Adjusted income component measures and the 
Adjusted diluted earnings pershare measure are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S
. GAAP net income, U.S. GAAP net income components or U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share.The following are examples of how the Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are utilized:
•
senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis;•
our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis; and38
 
 2017 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
•
senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures. Adjusted income is theperformance metric utilized in the determination of bonuses under the Pfizer Inc. Executive Annual Incentive Plan 
that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to theExecutive Leadership Team (ELT) for purposes of IRC Section 162(m). Subject to the Section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are 
funded from a pool based on theperformance measured by three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from Adjusted income. This metric accounts for 40% of the
bonus pool funding. The pool applies to the bonus plans for virtually all bonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the ELT members and other members
of senior management. In addition, commencing with the 2015 Performance Share Awards, adjusted operating income is one of the measures utilized to de
termine payout.Adjusted operating income is derived from Adjusted income.
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures that have no s
tandardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAPand, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, Adjusted income and its components
 (unlike U.S. GAAP net incomeand its components) and Adjusted diluted earnings per share (unlike U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share) may not be comparable to the calculation of
 similar measures ofother companies. Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how
management assesses performance.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, the Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted
 diluted earnings per share measures have limitations, andwe do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all
events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and
 do not provide a comparable view of our performance to othercompanies in the biopharmaceutical industry. We also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D
organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on
 an absolute basis and relative to a publicly tradedpharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of Pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans.
See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted
 information for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 below. Purchase Accounting Adjustments
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These
impacts, primarily associated with Wyeth (acquired in 2009), Hospira (acquired in 2015), Anacor (acquired in June 2016) and Medivation (acquired in September 2016), can
include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to
 fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of theacquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets
 (primarilymanufacturing facilities), amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. Therefore, 
theAdjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those
 products.Certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance tha
t is used bymanagement to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and
investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been
expensed.
However, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through Adjusted income. This
component of Adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this sec
tion. We have not factored in the impacts of any otherdifferences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does no
t intend to berepresentative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and
 in the periods presented, may have been different; ourspeed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been
 different. In addition, our marketing efforts mayhave been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, there can be
 no assurance that our Adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented hadwe discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.
Acquisition-Related Costs
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these
costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate 
two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. For additionalclarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are
included in acquisition-related costs. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.
We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection
with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities.
For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the con
text of abusiness combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.
The integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three
years of the transaction. Because of the need 
for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activitiescan be lengthy. For example, due to the highly regulated nature of the
2017 Financial Report    
 
 39
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must
 beapproved by the FDA and/or other global regulatory authorities.
Discontinued Operations
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such
operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do
not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. Restatements due to discontinued operations do
 not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measurefor the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented 
for consistency across all periods.Certain Significant Items
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated on an
individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of their nature.
 Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult topredict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs
stand on their own as they are specific to an event or goal with a defined 
term, but we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, costproductivity or in response to loss of exclusivity or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances
specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the
 date of acquisition.Unusual items may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a
 result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of ournormal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be
included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs; amounts related to certain disposals of
businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under U.S. GA
AP; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution ofcertain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation, such as the TCJA
 discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations 
or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 17A. Commitments and Contingencies: Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 1, “Legal Proceedings” in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Normal, ongoing defense costs of the Company or settlements of and accruals for legal matters made in the
 normal course of our business would not be considered certain significantitems.

The effective tax rate on Non-GAAP Adjusted income was 20.0% in 2017 , 23.0% in 2016 and 24.0% in 2015 . The decrease in the effective tax r ate on Non-GAAP Adjusted income for 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to tax benefits ass
ociated with the enactment of the TCJA, primarily reflecting the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on deemed repatriated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiariesthat were accrued during 2
017, as well as a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, partially offset by a decrease in benefitsassociated with the resolution 
of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The decline in the effective tax rate onNon-GAAP Adjusted income in 
2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a favorable c hange in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, an increasein tax benefits associated with th

ulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries associated with the TCJA. Given the significant changes resulting from and complexities associated with the TCJA, the estimatedfinancial impacts for 2017 are 
provisional and subject to further analysis, interpretation and clarification of the TCJA, which could result in changes to these estimates during 2018. The amount in 2016 was favorably impacted by benefits r
elated to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve certain claims related to Protonix, which resulted in thereceipt of information that raise
d our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position. The amount in 2015 was favorably impacted by tax benefits associated withcertain tax initiat

 WRD—the R&D expenses managed by our WRD organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our IH business until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projectsto the IH segment via the GPD orga
nization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRD organizationalso has responsibility for certain sci

all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities.(ii)
 
GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios. GPD also providestechnical support and oth
er services to Pfizer R&D projects.(iii)
 
Corporate—the costs associated with Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs,compliance, and worldwide pr
ocurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments. Effective in the first quarter of 2017,Corporate also includes the c
osts associated with our Pfizer Medical organization (Medical), previously reported as part of Other Business Activities. Medical is responsible for the provision of medicalinformation to healthcare pr
oviders, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities, clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, andpartnerships with global pu
blic health and medical associations. We have reclassified approximately $165 million and $177 million of Medical costs from Other Business Activities to C orporate in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, to conform to the curre

foreign exchange-denominated forecasted intercompany inventory sales.(iv)
 
Other Unallocated—other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as businessunit (segment) management doe
s not manage these costs (which include manufacturing variances associated with production).For information purposes only, the following tables present reconciliations of our segment operating results to segment operating results including estimated Other costs
generally associated with each segment for 2017. While we do not manage our segments or have performance goals under such an allocated manner, we believe that some

the U.S. due to a high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller
remaining “catch up” opportunity compared to 2016, partially offset by growth from the pediatric indication. International revenues increased
primarily due to the favorable overall impact of timing and increased volume associated with government purchases in certain emerging markets
for the pediatric indication compared with prior year, as well as from the inclusion of Prevenar 13 in additional national immunization programs in
certain emerging markets for the adult and pediatric indications in the fourth of quarter 2017.

•
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues decrease d 0.8 percentage points primarily driven by a favorable change in product mix, including an increase in alliance revenue, which have no associated cost of sales, partially offset by an increase in royalty expense, mostly related 
to Ibrance.•
The increase in Cost of sales of 1% was primarily driven by an increase in royalty expense, mostly related to Ibrance, partially offset by a favorable change in product mix.•
The decrease in Selling, informational and administrative expenses of 1% was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of an allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable,resulting from unfavorable developments with a distributor that was recorded in the first quarter of 2016, lower spending for certain products, primarily Prevnar 13/Prevenar
13 and Viagra (which lost exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2017), partially offset by additional investment across several of our key products, primarily Eucrisa, Ibrance
and Xeljanz.
•
The decrease in Research and development expenses of 13% primarily reflects: ◦
the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for bococizumab in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the non-recurrence of its associated close-out costs,48

an expense of $28 million , representing IH’s portion of the $75 million expense resulting from our May 2017 agreement with Sangamo to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for Hemophilia A.
•
The unfavorable change in Other (income)/deductions––net primarily reflects: ◦
lower royalty income for Enbrel of $470 million , resulting from the expiration on October 31, 2016 of the 36-month royalty period under the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada (the collaboration period under the agreement expired on October 31, 2013); and

2017 include approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations, while operating results for EH for 
2016 reflect 12 months of HIS global operations. •
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increase d 1.6 percentage points primarily due to cost increases reflecting the shift to EH of certain legacy Hospira costs that were previously unallocated to EH as a result of harmonizing the Hospira cost policy, and the impact of product losses of exclusivity, partially offset by
 the favorable impact ofthe sale of HIS, which had a higher cost of sales than 
the other EH products, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.•
The decrease in Cost of sales of 5% primarily reflects:◦
the favorable impact of the sale of HIS, which had a higher cost of sales than the other EH products;◦
the favorable impact of foreign exchange;◦
a net decrease in royalty expense and, to a lesser extent,◦
lower volumes driven by, among other things, the SIP portfolio, primarily due to legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.,partially offset by:
◦
cost increases reflecting the shift to EH of certain legacy Hospira costs that were previously unallocated to EH as a result of harmonizing the Hospira cost policy.•
Selling, informational and administrative expenses decrease d 11% primarily due to the favorable impact of the sale of HIS, lower advertising, promotional, and field force expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives 
, as well as lower expenses associated wi th products that recently lost marketing exclusivity , partially offset by increased spending for biosimilars, primarily related to the U.S. launch of Inflectra.
•
Research and development expenses decrease d 15% primarily due to decreased spending for biosimilars, the close-out of certain post-marketing clinical trials and the favorable impact of the sale of HIS.
•
The favorable change in Other (income)/deductions––net primarily reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange, a gain on the redemption of an acquired bond and an increase in Inflectra royalty income, partially offset by the non-recurrence of a resolution of a contract disagreement in the first quarter of
 2016.2016 
vs. 2015EH 
Revenues increase d 7% to $23.6 billion . Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 4% . EH Revenues excluding the contribution from the legacy Hospira portfolio, decreased 8%, or 3% operationally.

In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the line item, 
Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures , is presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these changes do not reflect actual cash inflows or out
flows, and excluding any other significant non-cash movements.Accordingly, the amounts shown will not necessarily agree with the changes in the assets and liabilities that are presented in our consolidated balance sheets.
Operating Activities
2017 
v. 2016Our net cash provided by operating activities was 
$16.5 billion in 2017 , compared to $15.9 billion in 2016 . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course of business, partially 
offset by an increase in benefit plan contributions. In 2017 , the change in the line item 
Other adjustments, net primarily reflects, among other items: •
a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense;•
an increase in dividends from our investment in ViiV reclassified from operating to investing activities; and•
an increase in gains from sales of available-for-sale securities,partially offset by:
•
a non-cash net loss on early retirement of debt under an exchange offer.In

Other adjustments, net, primarily reflects, among other items, an increase in the provision for bad debt expense and a decrease in net realized gains on sale of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by the non-cash changes in the equity losses related to Hisun Pfizer and Teuto. In addition,
 the adoption ofa new accounting standard in 2016 required that cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes is shown as a cash outflow from financing
activities rather than operating activities.

2017 
v. 2016Our net cash used in financing activities was 
$13.0 billion in 2017 , compared to $8.9 billion in 2016 . The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
the issuance of long-term debt of $5.3 billion in 2017 , compared to $11.0 billion in 2016 (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt 
); and •
$7.7 billion cash dividends paid in 2017 , compared to $7.3 billion in the same period in 2016 , partially offset by:

purchases of common stock of $5.0 billion in 2016 , compared to $6.2 billion in 2015 , partially offset by:
•
net payments on short-term borrowings of $714 million in 2016 , compared to net proceeds on short-term borrowings of $4.3 billion in 2015 ; •
higher repayments on long-term debt of $7.7 billion in 2016 , compared to $3.0 billion in 2015 ; •

lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.0 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.3 billion in 2015 . ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. We
continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. We target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable,
and other working capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows. Due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital
markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable
future, which include:
•
the working capital requirements of our operations, including our R&D activities;•
investments in our business;•
dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•
share repurchases;•
the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•
paying down outstanding debt;•
contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•
business-development activities.Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. See the “Credit Ratings” section below. As market conditions change,
 we continue to monitor our liquidityposition. We have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Bo
th short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified available-for-sale debt securities.

 See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 7. Financial Instruments for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.(b)
 
The decrease in selected net financial liabilities was primarily driven by the increase in short-term investments, partially offset by the net increase in long-term debt. We retain a strong financial liquidity position as aresult of our net cash provide
d by operating activities, our high-quality financial asset portfolio and access to capital markets. Both Moody’s and S&P rating agencies maintained our strong investment-gradecorporate debt rating subs
equent to the acquisitions of Medivation and Anacor. For additional information, see the “Credit Ratings” section of this Financial Review.(c) 
 The increase in working capital was primarily due to:•
an increase in short-term investments primarily from the cash generated from operations;•
a decrease in short-term borrowings resulting from less long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months;•
an increase in inventory related to new or potential products; and•
the net impact of foreign currency exchange,partially offset by:
•
the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business; and•
the sale of HIS assets to ICU Medical.(d) 
 Represents total Pfizer Inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of common shares outstanding (which excludes treasury stock).For additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the “Analysis of 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets ” and “ Analysis of the Consolidated Statements ofCash Flows

£833 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2038 with an interest rate of 6.50% for £ 1.376 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2043 with an interest rate of 
2.735% (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt 
). In March 2017, we completed a public offering of 
$1.065 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2047 with an interest rate of 4.20% , and on March 6, 2017, we completed a public offering of € 
4.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 0.23% (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

In June 2016, we completed a public offering of 
$5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 2.09% . Domestic and Internatio
nal Short-Term FundsMany of our operations are conducted outside the U.S., and significant portions of
 our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. We havegenerally held up to $10 billion of these short-term funds in U.S. tax jurisdictions. The amount of funds held in U.
S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receiptsand payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. As part
 of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularlymonitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Given the recent changes in tax law under the TCJA
, which includes transitioning U.S.international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, we have recorded a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of
foreign subsidiaries for which we plan to elect payment over eight years through 2026. See the “Contractual Obligations” section below for additional information. These
changes will also allow us to more easily access our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments globally. As a result of the enactment of 
the TCJA, we expect torepatriate the majority of our cash held internationally in 2018.
Accounts Receivable
We continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several European markets where economic conditions remain challenging
and uncertain. Historically, payments from a number of these European governments and government

agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale. Specifically, we received delayed payments for 2016 revenues from the 
Greek government; virtually all Greecegovernment receivables pertain to 2017 revenues. Also, the Greek government restructured its debt to other 
third parties in the third quarter of 2016. We determined ourallowance for doubtful accounts to reflect these events, and have $33
 million in net receivables from the Greek government as of December 31, 2017 . Reported revenues from all customers in Greece for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 were $248 million. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on an analysis of the
 following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistencyof payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring
industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).
As of 
December 31, 2017 , we had about $307 million aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. Such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $21 million, were as follows: $12 million in
Portugal; $4 million in Italy; 
$4 million in Greece; and $1 million in Spain. Although certain European governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to
 appropriately balancerepayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.
We will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
 uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 1C. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Estimates and Assumptions 
. Credit Ratings
Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any o
ther rating.The following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:
NAME OF RATING AGENCY

  Date of Last Rating Change
  Rating  Rating  Moody’s 
(a)  P-1  A1  October 2009 S&P 
(b)  A-1+  AA  October 2009 (a) 
 In September 2016, Moody's updated its credit outlook from negative outlook to stable.(b) 
 In April 2016, S&P updated its credit outlook from negative watch to stable.Debt Capacity
We have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and
short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. As of 
December 31, 2017 , we had access to $7.8 billion of lines of credit, of which $712 million 
expire within one year. Of these lines of credit, $7.7 billion were unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. Also, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 
$7.0 billion of unused revolving credit facility expiring in 2022, which may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings. Global Economic Conditions––Ge
neralThe global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significant operating cash
flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and
 will maintain, the abilityto meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions.
Global Economic Conditions––U.K.
In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a
 referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. In March 2017, the U.K. government formally notified theEuropean Council of its intention to leave the EU after it triggered Article 50 of 
the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit andoutlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. Formal negotiations officially started in June 2017
. This process continues to be highly complex and the end resultof these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including the approval and supply of
our products.
We generated approximately 
2% of our worldwide revenues from the U.K. in 2017. However, except for the foreign currency exchange impact from the weakening U.K. poundrelative to the U.S. dollar to date, there are no other immediate-term impacts to our business as there has no
t yet been a formal change in the relationship between the U.K. andthe EU. In addition, because of the significant uncertainties associated with 
the negotiation process, any potential long-term impacts are not currently determinable.58

Global Economic Conditions––Ven
ezuela OperationsOur Venezuela operations continue to operate with the U.S. dollar as the func
tional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy.In the second quarter of 2015, the Venezuelan government identified three o
fficial rates of exchange. These were the CENCOEX rate of 6.3; the SICAD rate of 13.5 (as ofFebruary 2018); and the SIMADI rate of 
29,000 (as of February 2018). Effective in March 2016, the CENCOEX rate was replaced by the  DIPRO rate of 10 (as of February2018); the SICAD rate ceased to be offered; and
 the SIMADI rate was planned to be replaced by the DICOM rate. Effective January 26, 2018, the DIPRO rate ceased to beoffered. The Venezuelan government continued to publish the SIMADI rate,
 which was commonly referred to as the DICOM rate, and then began to publish the DICOM ratebeginning in August 2017. That SIMADI, now DICOM, rate has grown from 206 in March 2016 
to about 29,000 (as of February 2018). Based on conditions in Venezuela, we resolved that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation are no longer expected to be subs
tantially settled at the Venezuelangovernment CENCOEX official rate of 
6.3 or the DIPRO official rate of 10 , but at a rate of 500 at the end of the second quarter and third quarter of 2016, and 670 at the end ofthe fourth quarter of 2016, and at the end
 of the first and second quarters of 2017, and 2,640 at the end of the third quarter of 2017 and 3 ,345 at the end of the fourth quarter of2017.
In 2015, conditions in Venezuela had us resolve that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject
 to revaluation were no longer expected to besettled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.3
, but at the then SIMADI rate of 200, the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtainsignificant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar-denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects of
 the implementation of a fourth-quarter2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a restructuring charge of $39 million related to a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes
in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy. The effect of tha
t change in expectation was a foreign currency loss of $806 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015included in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions—Net. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we had an inventory impairment loss of $72 million included in 
Cost of sales . We cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the Venezuelan currency or whether our use of the DICOM rate will continue to be
 supported by evolving factsand circumstances. Further, other potential actions by the Venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in
Venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and, under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as
we have historically.
On July 11, 2016, the Venezuelan government administration announced a new program under a State of
 Emergency decree that is intended to control the use of rawmaterials, production and distribution of products, specifically for medicines and foods. It is uncertain how this program will be applied to Pfizer in Venezuela. We continue to
operate under adverse conditions in Venezuela and have 
$12 million of net monetary assets and $39 million of non-monetary assets, excluding inventory carried at lower of cost or net realizable value, in Venezuela at November 30, 2017, our international year-end.

ents, as the impact of changes in economic conditions on the fair value of the pension plan assets and/or liabilities can be significant. We made a $500 million voluntarycontribution to our U.
S. pension plan in February 2018. Also, excludes $5.4 billion of liabilities related to legal matt ers, employee terminations and the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other, most ofwhich do not represent contr
actual obligations. See also our liquidity discussion above in this “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section, as well as the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements—

 Includes only income tax amounts currently payable. We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our noncurrent obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issuesand the resolution of thos
e issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.The above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to
occur. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization
milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.
In 
2018 , we expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion on property, plant and equipment. We rely largely on operating cash flows to fund our capital investment needs. Due to our significant operating cash flows, we believe we have the ability to meet our capital investment needs and anticipate no delays to planned capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and
 other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certainliabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If 
the indemnified party were to make asuccessful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnification obligations generally are subject to various
restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2017 , the estimated fair value of our indemnification obligations was not significant.
Certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-
promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.
Share-Purchase Plans and Ac
celerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOur October 2014 $11 billion share-purchase plan was exhausted in the first quarter of 2017. In December 2015, the 
Board of Directors authorized an $11 billion sharerepurchase program, and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2017.
On February 9, 2015 and March 8, 2016, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with GS&Co. 
to repurchase, in each case, $5 billion of our common stock.On February 2, 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank to repurchase 
$5 billion of our common stock. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. This new program is in addition to the $6.4 billion
remaining under the company’s December 2015 authorization as of December 31, 2017.

2017 , our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $16.4 billion . Dividends on Common Stock
We paid dividends on our common stock of 
$7.7 billion in 2017 , $7.3 billion in 2016 and $6.9 billion in 2015 . In December 2017 , our Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2018 dividend of 
$0.34 per share, payable on March 1, 2018 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 2, 2018 . The first-quarter 2018 cash dividend will be our 317 
th consecutive quarterly dividend.Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our businesses and to seek to increase shareholder
value. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s Board of Directors and will continue to be evaluated in the
context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards.Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not 
Adopted as of December 31, 2017 (Effective January 1, 2018) The following table provides a brief description of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted:
Standard/Description
  Effective Date   Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersIn May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance related to
revenue from contracts with customers 
. The new guidance introduces a new principles-based framework for revenue
recognition and disclosure. Since its issuance the FASB has
issued seven ASUs, amending the guidance and effective date,
and the SEC has rescinded certain related SEC guidance.
 
January 1, 2018 
We have substantially completed our review of the impact of thisguidance across our various business arrangements and revenue-
related activities, and do not expect the adoption of this s
tandard tohave a material impact on our reported 
Revenues  in our consolidated financial statements, revenue recognition processes, or our internal
controls. We are reviewing our disclosures for revenue recognition and
do not anticipate significant changes will be needed to conform with the
disclosure requirements of the new guidance.
The interpretation and applicability of the new revenue recognition
standard to collaboration arrangements in certain industries is still
being assessed. We expect that milestone payments received in our
collaboration agreements, which are recorded in 
Other ( income ) /deductions 
–– net , and currently amortized over the life of theagreement, will, for many arrangements, be amortized over the
remaining development period or sooner, if there is a distinct and
separable licensing component. We are required to apply the new rules
to existing contracts as if the new principles had always existed, and
therefore, upon adoption, we expect to record a cumulative effect
adjustment to 
Retained earnings  as of the adoption date in the range of $600 million to $700 million to accelerate what would have been
future income under the current rules into prior periods. The financial
statement impact on pre-tax income is expected to be less than $100
million in any future annual period.
We continue to monitor additional changes, modifications, clarifications
or interpretations undertaken by the FASB, which may impact our
current conclusions.
In January 2016, the FASB issued an update 
to its guidance onrecognition and measurement of 
financial assets and liabilities . Among other things, the new guidance makes the following
targeted changes to existing guidance:
1. Requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair
value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments
that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus
impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the
identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
2. Requires a qualitative assessment of equity investments
without readily determinable fair values to identify impairment.
3. Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial
liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset
on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the
financial statements.
  January 1, 2018. 
We have completed our review of the impact of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, we
have $1.2 billion in available-for-sale equity securities and
approximately $222 million of restricted stock and private equity
securities that will be subject to the new rules. Further, for the year
ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $586 million of previously
unrealized holding gains and $124 million of previously unrealized
losses on available-for-sale equity securities in 
Other comprehensive income 
, which would have been recorded to Other (income)/ deductions 
–– net under the new rules. The net unrealized gain onequity investments subject to the new rules of $462 million as of
December 31, 2017 will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment
to 
Retained earnings upon adoption on January 1, 2018 . We expectthe adoption of this new accounting standard may increase the
volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value
of equity investments. We do not expect that
 the proposed amendmentwill have any substantive impact to our assessment discussed above.

Standard/Description
  Effective Date   Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersIn August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on
 theclassification of certain transactions in the Statement of
Cash Flows.
 
January 1, 2018. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We have completed our review of the impact of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. Retrospective application is
required. Upon adoption, we expect to reclassify approximately $378
million and $362 million of cash outflows related to debt redemption in
2017 and 2016, respectively, from operating activities to financing
activities. We also expect to reclassify approximately $21 million and
$28 million of cash inflows from trust-owned life insurance contracts in
2017 and 2016, respectively, from operating activities to investing
activities. Cash outflows from trust-owned life insurance contracts
represent benefit payments and are classified as operating activities.
Lastly, we expect to reclassify cash outflows attributable to the
accreted interest related to commercial paper of $63 million and $33
million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, from financing activities to
operating activities. In addition, although there is no impact on the
presented historical comparative financial statements, the new
guidance may impact the classification of certain cash flows related to
contingent consideration in a business acquisition, depending on the
ultimate settlement amount of the reported contingency liability.
In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on 
thepresentation of 
restricted cash in the Statement of Cash Flows.
 
January 1, 2018. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We have completed our review of the impact of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. Retrospective application is
required. Our restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2016 were
approximately $46.4 million of short-term restricted cash and $47.6
million of long-term restricted cash. Our restricted cash balances as of
December 31, 2017 were approximately $36.8 million of short-term
restricted cash and $75.3 million of long-term restricted cash.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an upda
te to its guidance onincome tax 
 accounting. The new guidance replaces the prohibition against recognizing current and deferred income taxes
for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to
an outside party with a requirement to do so, unless the asset
transferred is inventory.
 
January 1, 2018. 
We have substantially completed our review but are currentlyassessing the potential implications of the recently enacted TCJA. Our
analysis of the standard indicates that our estimate of the impact to
 ourconsolidated financial statements, using current assumptions, is not
material. However, while we currently do not have any specific plans,
we cannot predict intercompany asset transfers other than inventory
that may occur in the future, as they are dependent on
 economic andoperational factors that may change over time.
For example, an acquisition might cause us to realign legal entities and
to transfer assets between entities as we integrate an acquired
company into Pfizer. We anticipate that after adoption, our ef
fective taxrate could be impacted by the immediate recognition of the tax
consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory.
The impact of adoption is expected to be approximately $200 million
and will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce
Retained earnings.
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the
definition of a business 
. The new guidance provides a new framework for determining whether business development
transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or
disposals) of assets or businesses. If the fair value of the gross
assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, the
transaction will not qualify for treatment as a business. The new
guidance also requires that to be considered a business, a set of
integrated activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an
input and a substantive process that together significantly
contribute to the ability to create outputs, without regard as to
whether a market participant could replace missing elements. In
addition, the new guidance narrows the definition of the term
“output” to make it consistent with how outputs are described in
the updated revenue recognition guidance.
  January 1, 2018. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We have completed our review of the impact of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. The new accounting standard is
applicable on a prospective basis upon adoption and therefore has no
impact on completed transactions. We expect that subsequent to our
adoption date of January 1, 2018, fewer transactions will be accounted
for as business acquisitions (decreasing the amount of goodwill
incurred and potentially increasing IPR&D expense) or disposals of a
business. We will continue to monitor for changes in our business, and
business combination or other transactions which might close after
adoption and be impacted by this new standard.

Standard/Description
  Effective Date   Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersIn February 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance related to
the 
derecognition of nonfinancial assets. 
January 1, 2018. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We have completed our review of the impact of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. The new guidance applies to the
full or partial sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets, including intangible
assets, real estate and inventory, under which the gain or loss is the
difference between the consideration received and the carrying value
of the asset. The new guidance does not impact out-licensing
arrangements. We are not expecting a material impact on existing
transactions. We will continue to monitor for changes in our business
and transactions which might be impacted by this new standard.
In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of
net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. 
Under the new rules, entities that sponsor defined benefit plans will
present net benefit cost as follows:
1. Service cost will be included in the same income statement line
items where other employee compensation costs are reported.
2. The other components of net benefit cost will be presented
outside of income from operations, if such a subtotal is
presented.
3. Only the service cost component will be capitalized, when
applicable (for example, as a cost of inventory, internal-use
software, or a self-constructed fixed asset).
If a separate line item is used to present the other components of
net benefit cost, it should have an appropriate description. If a
separate line item or items is not used, the line item or items in
the income statement where the other components of net benefit
cost are included must be disclosed.
  January 1, 2018. 
We have completed our review of the impact of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption, the net benefit
costs other than service costs will be reclassified to 
Other ( income ) /deductions 
–– net from their current classification within Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, 
and Research anddevelopment expenses 
. Retrospective application is required. Beginning in 2018, we will capitalize only the service cost component
of the net benefit costs on a prospective basis. Net
 benefitcost/(income) other than service costs was $114 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 and $154 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 (see Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements–– 
Note 11.   Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plansand Defined Contribution Plans 
 for further details). In May 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on the accoun
tingfor 
modifications of share-based payment awards . The new guidance clarifies that changes in the terms or conditions of a
share-based payment award be accounted for as a modification
unless all the following conditions are met:
The fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair
value of the original award immediately before the original award
is modified.
The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as
the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before
the original award is modified.
The modification does not change the classification of the
award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument.
  January 1, 2018. Earlyapplication is permitted,
including in interim periods.
 
We have completed our review of the impact of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. The new accounting standard is
applicable on a prospective basis upon adoption and therefore has no
impact on completed transactions. The impact of adopting this
guidance will be dependent upon whether we make any future
modifications of share-based payment awards, and we have no plans
to modify share-based payment awards at this time.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not 
Adopted as of December 31, 2017 (Effective January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020) 
The following table provides a brief description of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted:Standard/Description
  Effective Date   Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersIn February 2016, the FASB issued an update to
 its guidance onleases 
. The new ASU provides guidance for both lessee and lessor accounting models. Among other things, the new guidance
requires that a right of use asset and a lease liability be
recognized for leases with a duration of greater than one year.
 
January 1, 2019. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We have made substantial progress in completing our review of theimpact of this new guidance. We anticipate recognition of at least $2
billion of additional assets and corresponding liabilities on our balance
sheet. We are currently assessing the potential impact of embedded
leases on our consolidated financial statements, given our
manufacturing outsourcing, service arrangements and other
agreements. In connection with this guidance we will need to design
new global processes and technological solutions to provide the
appropriate financial accounting and disclosure data. We continue to
monitor changes, modifications, clarifications or interpretations
undertaken by the FASB, which may impact our conclusions.
In March 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that shortens 
theamortization period for certain callable debt securities held at
a premium 
. The new guidance requires the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date.
 
January 1, 2019. Earlyapplication is permitted,
including in interim periods, so
long as any adjustments are
reflected as of the beginning of
the fiscal year that includes the
interim period in which the
guidance is applied.
  We are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements.
In July 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for
certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities
and equity, 
 and accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features 
(a feature in a financial instrument that reduces the strike price of an issued financial instrument if the
issuer sells shares of its stock for an amount less than the
currently stated strike price of the issued financial instrument or
issues an equity-linked financial instrument with a strike price
below the currently stated strike price of the issued financial
instrument).
  January 1, 2019. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance making targeted
improvements to 
accounting for hedging activities . The objective of this amendment is to improve financial reporting of
hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an
entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements, and
also to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance.
  January 1, 2019. Early adoptionis permitted, including in interim
periods.
 
We are planning to early adopt this standard in the first quarter ofcalendar year 2018. We do not expect the adoption to have a
 materialimpact on our financial statements.
In February 2018, the FASB issued an update to
 its guidance onthe 
reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulatedother comprehensive income 
. The new guidance provides an option for us to elect to reclassify the stranded tax amounts
related to the TCJA. If reclassified, the reclassification from AOCI
to retained earnings for stranded tax effects would include:
1. the effect of the change in 
the U.S. federal corporate tax rate;and
2. other stranded tax amounts related to the application of the
TCJA that we elect to reclassify, if any.
The reclassification, if elected, may be applied either
retrospectively or at the beginning of the annual or interim period
in which the amendments are adopted.
  January 1, 2019. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We are evaluating the election and assessing the impact of theprovisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.

Standard/Description
  Effective Date   Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersIn June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting 
forcredit losses of financial instruments 
. The new guidance replaces the probable initial recognition threshold for incurred loss
estimates in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects
expected credit loss estimates.
 
January 1, 2020. Earlierapplication is permitted as of
fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within that fiscal
year.
 
We are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance onour consolidated financial statements. Previously, when credit losses
were measured under GAAP, an entity generally only considered past
events and current conditions in measuring the incurred loss. The new
guidance requires us to identify, analyze, document and support new
methodologies for quantifying expected credit loss estimates for our
financial instruments, using information such as historical experience
and current economic environmental conditions, plus the use of
reasonable supportable forecast information.
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance for 
goodwill impairment testing 
. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to
measure goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance the
goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value
of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount
of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, although it cannot
exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit.
  January 1, 2020. Earlierapplication is permitted.
 
We have not yet completed our review of the impact of this newguidance on our consolidated financial statements. However, we do
not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate
assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past
results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements, and are cautioned no
t to put unduereliance on forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except
 as required by law or bythe rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult
 any further disclosures we make on related subjects.Certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions are discussed here and under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of
 our Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2017 
. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible topredict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete se
t of all potential risks or uncertainties.The operating segment information provided in this report does not purport to represent the revenues, costs and income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for
taxes on income that each of our operating segments would have recorded had each segment operated as a
 standalone company during the periods presented.This report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. These studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical
data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context
 of the larger body of data. In addition, clinical trial data aresubject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support
 the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-lineproduct, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.
Financial Risk Management
The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings. We
manage these financial exposures through operational means and through the use of third-party instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change.
Foreign Exchange Risk
We operate globally and, as such, we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations, as well as in our financial assets (investments) and liabilities
(borrowings). Our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to currency risk.
On the commercial side, a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. See 
the “ Our Operating Environment — TheGlobal Economic Environment 
” section of this Financial Review for the key currencies in which we operate. We 68
 
 2017 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-
currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Where foreign exchange risk cannot be mitigated via operational means, we may use foreign currency forward-exchange
contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to manage that risk.
With respect to our financial assets and liabilities, our primary foreign exchange exposure arises predominantly from short-term and long-term intercompany receivables and
payables, and, to a lesser extent, from short-term and long-term investments and debt, where the asse
ts and/or liabilities are denominated in currencies other than thefunctional currency of the business entity.
We also hedge some forecasted intercompany sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, U.K. pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar to protect
against longer-term movements.
In addition, under certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments o
f our foreign business entities. In these cases,we may use foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency debt.
For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Fair Value Measurements 
. The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding
all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S.
 dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative to theU.S. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of 
December 31, 2017 , the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and on our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on 
Pfizer’s immediate andintermediate liquidity needs.
With respect to our investments, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but our strategy may change based on
 prevailing market conditions. Ourfloating-rate assets are subject to the risk that short-term interest rates may fall and, as a
 result, the investments would generate less interest income. Fixed-rate investmentsprovide a known amount of interest income regardless of a change in interest rates. We sometimes use interest rate swaps in our financial investment portfolio.
With respect to our long-term borrowings, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but here too, we may change our strategy depending upon
prevailing market conditions. We generally issue debt with a fixed rate, and then use interest rate swaps to convert it into
 floating-rate debt as we deem appropriate in thecircumstances. This effective floating rate debt serves to offset some o
f the interest rate risks associated with our short-term and floating-rate investments.For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Fair Value Measurements 
. The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding all other
assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point increase in interest
rates as of 
December 31, 2017 , the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant. Contingencies
Legal Matters
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-
related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications (see Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements— 
Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies). Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial.
We believe that our claims and defenses in these matters are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do no
t believe that anyof these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the
outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of
 operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or ourcash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that
 have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment processrelies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause
 us tochange those estimates and assumptions.
Tax Matters
2017 Financial Report    
 
 69
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business for tax matters (see Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements— 
Note 5D. Tax Matters: Tax Contingencies). We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of
 a tax benefit, we regularly monitor ourposition and subsequently recognize the tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that
 sufficiently raise the likelihood ofprevailing on the technical merits of the position to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable
settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on 
the results of audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings,statute of limitations expirations, changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to 
the “more-likely-than-not” standard.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but
 our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potentialtax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such es
timates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or whenthe statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as
 discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formaladministrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to
 our uncertain tax positions, and such changescould be significant.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management’s Report
We prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in our 
2017 Financial Report. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and es
timates. We also accept responsibility for thepreparation of other financial information that is included in this document.
Report on Internal Control Ove
r Financial ReportingThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
 Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
 financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness to futureperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that
 the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures maydeteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2017 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2017 . The Company’s independent auditors have issued their auditors’ report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears in our 
2017 Financial Report under the heading, 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee reviews Pfizer’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements
and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.
The Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of Pfizer’s
results and the assessment of Pfizer’s internal control over financial reporting. We discussed significant accounting policies applied in Pfizer’s financial statements, as well as,
when applicable, alternative accounting treatments. Management represented to the Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management
and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed under
applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.
In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor’s independence from Pfizer and its management. As part
of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting
firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence
from Pfizer.
We also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm’s provision of non-audit services to Pfizer is compatible with the auditor’s independence. The
Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from Pfizer and its management.
As part of our responsibilities for oversight of Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management process, we reviewed and discussed company policies with respect to risk assessment and
risk management, including discussions of individual risk areas, as well as an annual summary of the overall process.
The Committee discussed with Pfizer’s Internal Audit Department and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits.
The Committee meets with the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance and Risk Officer and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in regular
and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of 
Pfizer’s internal controls, and the overall quality of Pfizer’s financial reporting andcompliance programs.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the 
Board has approved, that the auditedfinancial statements be included in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2017 , for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee has selected, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the selection of 
Pfizer’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2018 . The Audit Committee

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm onInternal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
The Board of Directors and Sha
reholders of Pfizer Inc.:Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We
 have audited Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting of as of December 31, 2017 ,  based on criteria established inInternal
 Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Companymaintained,
 in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 ,  based on criteria established in Internal Control-IntegratedFramework (2013) issued by COSO.
We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets ofPfizer
 Inc. and Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 ,  and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flowsfor
 each of the years in the three-year  period ended December 31, 2017 ,  and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report datedFebruary 22, 2018 
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial
 reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  theCompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent withrespect
 to the Company in accordance  with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities  and Exchange Commission and thePCAOB.
We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether effective
 internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financialreporting,
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our
 audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for ouropinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation offinancial
 statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes thosepolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
 reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of thecompany;
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles, and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;and
 (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company’s  assets  that  could  have  amaterial effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
 evaluation of effectiveness to futureperiods
 are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures maydeteriorate.

Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
A. Basis of Presentation
See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this 
2017 Financial Report for terms used throughout the consolidated financial statements and related notes of this 2017 
Financial Report. The consolidated financial statements include our parent company and all subsidiaries, and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The decision of
 whether or not to consolidate an entity requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economicor other control over the entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than vo
ting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information isincluded as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S.
 subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for eachyear presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our businesses
have been eliminated. Taxes paid on intercompany sales transactions are deferred until recognized upon sale of the asset to a third party.
We manage our commercial operations through 
two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). For additional information, seeNote 18 
. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to
 rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.Our recent significant business development activities include:
•
On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS, to ICU Medical, a global device manufacturer, for up to approximately $900 million 
, composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions and  devices. The operatingresults of HIS are included in the consolidated statement of income and EH’s operating results through February 2, 2017 and
, therefore, our financial results, and EH’soperating results, for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of
 HIS internationaloperations, while our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect 12 months of HIS global operations and 
for the year endedDecember 31, 2015 reflect four months of HIS U.S. operations and three months
 of HIS international operations. Assets and liabilities associated with HIS are presented asheld for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
•
On December 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S. for 
$1,045 million , composed of cash and contingent consideration. Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of this business, and
, in accordance with our international reportingperiod, our financial results, EH’s operating results, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 
2017 reflect approximately 11 months of the small molecule anti- infectives business acquired from AstraZeneca.
•
On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for $81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ( 
$13.9 billion , net of cash acquired). Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets , liabilities, operating results and cash flows ofMedivation. Therefore, Medivation operations are reflected in our financial results, IH’s operating results, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017. In
accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect approximately three
months of Medivation operations.
•
On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for $99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion , net of cash acquired), plus 
$698 million debt assumed. Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Anacor. Therefore, Anacor operations are reflected in our financial results, IH’s operating results, and cash flows for the
 year ended December 31, 2017. Inaccordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect approximately six
months of Anacor operations.
•
On April 6, 2016, we announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan entered into on November 22, 2015 was terminated by mutual agreement of thecompanies. The decision was driven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016
, which the companies concluded qualified as an“Adverse Tax Law Change” under the merger agreement. In connection with the termination of the merger agreement, on April 8, 2016 (which fell into Pfizer’s second fiscal
quarter), Pfizer paid Allergan 
$150 million (pre-tax) for reimbursement of Allergan’s expenses associated with the terminated transaction (see Note 4 ). Pfizer and Allergan also released each other from any and all claims in connection with the merger agreement.
•
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira for approximately $16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Hospira. In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect four months of Hospira U.S. operations and
 three months of Hospira international operations.For additional information, see

B. Adoption of New Accounting Standa
rds in 2017We adopted a new standard as of January 1, 2017 that
 amended guidance on the assessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Underthis new guidance, when evaluating whether an entity is the primary beneficiary, a single decision maker must consider its indirect interest held through related parties under
common control proportionately. There was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from adopting this standard.
We adopted a new standard as of January 1, 2017 related to inventory.
 The new guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value,which is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. There was no
material impact to our consolidated financial statements from adopting this standard.
C. Estimates and Assumptions
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affec
t reported amounts and disclosures, including amounts recorded anddisclosed in connection with acquisitions. These estimates and underlying assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated
statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues (such as rebates, chargebacks,
 sales allowances and sales returns), determining thecost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and
 estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well asdetermining provisions for taxes on income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, such as
 accountsreceivable, investments, inventories, deferred tax assets, fixed assets and intangible assets (including acquired IPR&D assets), and estimates are used
 in determining thereported amounts of liabilities, such as taxes payable, benefit obligations, accruals for contingencies, rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns, and
restructuring reserves, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but
 that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If ourestimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted.
As future events and their effects cannot be
 determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events andcircumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are subject
 to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ fromestimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions
using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts
 and circumstances indicate the need for change.For information on estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 5A . Tax Matters: Taxes on Income fromContinuing Operations.
D. Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We accoun
t for acquired businesses using theacquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of 
theacquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance shee
t. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the considerationtransferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that
 do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S.GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is expensed.
Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date
. Fair value is generallyestimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date
until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . Amounts recorded in connection with an acquisition can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. E. Fair Value
We are often required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, we use fair
value extensively in the initial recognition of net assets acquired in a business combination, when measuring certain impairment losses and when accounting for and reporting
of certain financial instruments. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the
highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and af
ter the transfer.When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of 
the following techniques:•
Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.•
Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.82
 
 2017 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
•
Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:
•
Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).•
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other thanquoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means
(Level 2 inputs).
•
Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).A single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Forinformation about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. F. Foreign Currency Translation
For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their
U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the
 balance sheet date and we translate functional currency income and expense amounts to their U.S. dollarequivalents at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects 
that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet da
te, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions–– net 
, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.G. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable
Revenue Recognition 
—We record revenues from product sales when the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer. A t the time of sale, we also record estimates fora variety of revenue deductions, such as chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. When we cannot reasonably estimate 
the amount of future sales returnsand/or other revenue deductions, we record revenues when the risk of product return and/or additional revenue deductions has been substantially eliminated.
Deductions from Revenues–– 
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the  same period that therevenues are recognized, and primarily represent chargebacks, rebates and sales allowances to wholesalers, and, to a lesser extent, distributors like MCOs, retailers and
government agencies with respect to our pharmaceutical products. Those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales 
for the reportingperiod and, as such, knowledge and judgment of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales 
for areporting period.
Specifically:
•
In the U.S., we record provisions for pharmaceutical Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid andactual prescriptions written during prior quarters. We apply the experience ratio to the respective period’s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This
experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to
Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap,” also known as the “doughnut hole,” based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and
consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the
 coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends andfuture expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in 
formulary status andrebate rates.
•
Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales withineach period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government’s to
tal unbudgetedpharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds, and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of
reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties) closely approximate actual as wesettle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices;historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; es
timated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time betweenshipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate o
f future returns, such as loss of exclusivity, product recalls or a changing competitiveenvironment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
•
We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the costof our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.

Our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and
cash discounts totaled 
$4.9 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively. The following table provides information about the balance sheet classification of these accruals:

Note 1C. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from 
Revenues . Collaborative Arrangements— 
Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature o f thearrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts
received from our collaboration partners as alliance revenues, a component of 
Revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded when our collaboration partners ship the product and title passes to their customer. The related expenses 
forselling and marketing these products are included in 
Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when our collaboration partners sell the product and title passes to their customers. All royalty payments to collaboration partners
are included in 
Cost of sales . Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions—net. Trade Accounts Receivable 
—Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance against gross trade accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
current information. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.
H. Cost of Sales and Inventories
We carry inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We
regularly review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.
I. Selling, Informational and Administ
rative ExpensesSelling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising,
shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense.
Advertising expenses totaled approximately 
$3.1 billion in 2017 , $3.2 billion in 2016 and $3.1 billion in 2015 . Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of radio time, television time and space in publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.
J. Research and Development Expenses
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs
 incurred in connection with certain licensingarrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments made by us to third parties under licensing arrangements as
expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives
regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.
R&D expenses related to upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights totaled 
$169 million in 2017 , $82 million in 2016 and $429 million in 2015 . For additional information, see 
Note 2C . K. Amortization of Intangible 
Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets include:
•
Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation —These assets are recorded at cost and are increased by the cost of any  significant improvements afterpurchase. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on
 a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of theindividual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.
84
 
 2017 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
•
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization —These acquired assets are recorded at fair value. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives that are associated with marketed products are not amortized until a useful life can be
determined. Intangible assets associated with IPR&D projects are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the 
EU, or in a seriesof other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. The useful life of an
 amortizing asset generally is determined by identifying the period inwhich substantially all of the cash flows are expected to be generated.
•
Goodwill —Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets . Goodwill is not amortized.Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds
and intellectual property is included in 
Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to intangible assets that are associated with a single function and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses 
and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
Specifically:
•
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairmentindicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset
, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to thecarrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book
 value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of animpairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
•
For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as Brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, forthe excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for I
PR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize theasset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.
•
For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that value to its book value. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, wethen determine the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the fair value of all the identifiable net assets other than goodwill from the fair value of 
the reporting unit andrecord an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value.
Impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about
the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. L. Restructuring Charges and 
Certain Acquisition-Related CostsWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our
cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. Included in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of
 an asset, that incremental impact isclassified in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition
are expensed as incurred 
. Amounts recorded for restructuring charges and other associated costs can result from a complex series of judgments about future events
 and uncertainties and can relyheavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. M. Cash Equivalents and Statement of 
Cash FlowsCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. 
If itemsmeeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as 
Short-term investments . Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the
classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the na
ture of thehedge instrument. Cash flows associated with financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to 
their purpose and accountingnature.
N. Investments and Derivative Financial Inst
rumentsOur investments are comprised of the following: trading funds and securities, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities (when we have both the positive intent and
ability to hold the investment to maturity) and private equity securities. The classification of an investment can depend on
 the nature of the investment, our intent and ability tohold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence.
•
Trading securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions—net. 2017 Financial Report    
 
 85
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
•
Available-for-sale debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized. •
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried at amortized cost.•
Private equity securities are carried at equity method or at cost method. For equity investments where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policiesof the investee, we use the equity-method of accounting. Under the
 equity-method, we record our share of the investee’s income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions —net 
. The excess of the cost of the  investment over our share of the equity of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets of the investee,with any remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which typically does not include amounts of contingent consideration.
Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.
We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity securities, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined to be other-than-
temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see 
Note 7A ), with changes in fair value reported in Net income or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7F ). A single estimate of fair value and impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. O. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies
Current tax assets primarily includes (i) tax effects associated with intercompany transfers of assets within our consolidated group, which are recognized in the consolidated
statement of income when the asset transferred is sold to a third-party or recovered through amortization of the asse
t's remaining economic life; and (ii) income tax receivablesthat are expected to be recovered either as refunds from taxing authorities or as a reduction to
 future tax obligations.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between 
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilitiesusing enacted tax rates and laws, including the recently enacted TCJA. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax asse
ts are not recoverablebased on an assessment of estimated future taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and
 feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary,to realize the deferred tax assets. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net amount
 in the noncurrent section of ourconsolidated balance sheet.
Other taxes payable includes liabilities for uncertain tax positions and an estimate of the repatriation tax liability on the deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 foreign
earnings recorded in connection with the TCJA for which we plan to elect payment over eight years through 2026. See 
Note 5A for additional information. We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a 
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely onthe technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit
 by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized uponsettlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
 has full knowledge of all relevant information.Under the benefit recognition model, if our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the
tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of 
theposition to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of tha
t tax year with theappropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on the results of audits of federal, state and
 foreign income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations,changes and clarification in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not
standard. Liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months.
 Interest and penalties, if any,are recorded in 
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability. Given the significant changes resulting from and complexities associated with the TCJA, the estimated financial impacts for 2017 are provisional and subject to further analysis, interpretation and clarification of the
TCJA, which could result in changes to these estimates during 2018. For additional information, see 
Note 5A . Amounts recorded for valuation allowances and income tax contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see

P. Pension and P
ostretirement Benefit PlansThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both qualified and supplemental(non-qualified) defined benefit and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees. We recognize
the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined bene
fit plans as an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The obligations are generally measured atthe actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement
obligations may include assumptions such as expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to
future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cos
t of providing medical insurance benefits,as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at
 fair value. Net periodicbenefit costs are recognized, as required, into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Amounts recorded for pension and postretirement benefit plans can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
 uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Q. Legal and Environmental Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-
related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. We record accruals for these
contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a
 loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate thanany other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range o
f loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, weaccrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.
Amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
 assumptions.For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. R. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values
are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses 
, as appropriate. Amounts recorded for share-based compensation can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see

A. Acquisitions
AstraZeneca’s Small Molecule Anti-Infectives Business (EH)
On December 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 
2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S., including the commercialization and development rights to the newly approved EU drug
Zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), the marketed agents Merrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem) and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets ATM-
AVI and CXL (ceftaroline fosamil-AVI). Under the terms of the agreement, we made an up
front payment of approximately $552 million to AstraZeneca upon the close of the transaction and an additional 
$3 million payment for a contractual purchase price adjustment in the second quarter of 2017. We also made a $50 million milestone payment in the second quarter of 2017, we made an additional milestone payment of 
$125 million in our first fiscal quarter of 2018 and we will make a deferred payment of $175 million to AstraZeneca in January 2019. In addition, AstraZeneca may be eligible to receive an additional milestone payment of 
$75 million if the related milestone is achieved prior to December 31, 2021, and up to 
$600 million if sales of Zavicefta™ exceed certain thresholds prior to January 1, 2026, as well as tiered royalties on sales of Zavicefta™  andATM-AVI in certain markets for a period ending on the later of 10 years from first commercial sale or the loss of patent
 protection or loss of regulatory exclusivity. The totalroyalty payments are unlimited during the royalty term and the undiscounted payments are expected to be in the range of
 approximately $250 million to $425 million . The total fair value of consideration transferred for AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business was approximately 
$1,045 million , which includes $555 million in cash, plus the fair value of contingent consideration of 
$490 million (which is composed of the deferred payment, the $50 million milestone payment made in the second quarter of 2017, the $125 million 
milestone payment made in our first fiscal quarter of 2018 and the future expected milestone and royalty payments). In  connection with this acquisition, weprovisionally recorded 
$879 million in Identifiable intangible assets , primarily consisting of $660 million in Developed technology rights and $219 million in IPR&D . We also recorded 
$92 million in Other current assets related to the economic value of inventory which was retained by AstraZeneca for sale on our behalf, $92 million in Goodwill and $17 million 
of net deferred tax liabilities. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has not been finalized. 2017 Financial Report

Medivation, Inc. (IH)
On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for 
$81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ( $13.9 billion 
, net of cash acquired). Of this consideration, approximately $365 million was not paid as of December 31, 2016, and was recorded in Other current liabilities. The remaining consideration was paid as of 
December 31, 2017 . Medivation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Medivation is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology. Medivation’s portfolio includes Xtandi (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in
the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells. Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. Astellas has exclusive
commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. In addition, Medivation has a development-stage oncology asset in its pipeline, talazoparib, which is currently in a Phase 3
study for the treatment of BRCA-mutated breast cancer. In
 connection with this acquisition, we recorded $12.2 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , primarily consisting of $8.1 billion 
of Developed technology rights with an average useful life of approximately 12 years and $4.1 billion of IPR&D, and recorded $6.1 billion of Goodwill, $4.0 billion of net income tax liabilities, and 
$259 million of assumed contingent consideration. In 2017 and 2016, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair valuesinitially recorded in 2016, which resulted in a reduction in 
Identifiable intangible assets of approximately $1.0 billion with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net income tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition
date. The 2017 results include a decrease of approximately 
$38 million to Amortization of intangible assets which reflects the cumulative pre-tax impact of the measurement period adjustments to 
Identifiable intangible assets that were amortized to the income statement since the acquisition date. The measurement period adjustments did not result from intervening events subsequent to the acquisition date. The final allocation of the consideration transferred to
 the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has beencompleted.
Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc. (IH)
On August 1, 2016, we acquired all the remaining equity in Bamboo, a privately-held biotechnology company focused on developing gene therapies for the po
tential treatmentof patients with certain rare diseases relating to neuromuscular conditions and those affecting the central nervous system, for 
$150 million , plus potential milestone payments of up to 
$495 million contingent upon the progression of key assets through development, regulatory approval and commercialization. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Bamboo was approximately 
$343 million , including cash of $130 million ( $101 million , net of cash acquired), contingent consideration of $167 million , consisting of milestone payments, and the fair value of Pfizer’s previously held equity interest in Bamboo of 
$45 million . We previously purchased a minority stake in Bamboo in the first quarter of 2016 for a payment of approximately 
$43 million . Upon acquiring the remaining interest in Bamboo in the third quarter of 2016, we recognized a gain of $2 million 
on our existing investment in Other (income)/deductions––net over the one-year allocation period . This acquisition provides us with several clinical and pre-clinicalassets that complement our rare disease portfolio, an advanced recombinant AAV vector design and production technology, and
 a fully functional Phase I/II gene therapymanufacturing facility. Bamboo is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded 
$330 million of Identifiable intangible assets, consisting entirely of 
IPR&D. We also recorded $142 million of Goodwill and $94 million of net deferred tax liabilities. The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed.
Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IH)
On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for 
$99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion net of cash acquired), plus 
$698 million debt assumed. Anacor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Anacor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on novel small-molecule therapeutics derived from its boron chemistry platform. Anacor’s crisaborole, a non-steroidal topical PDE-4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, was approved by the FDA
on December 14, 2016 under the trade name, Eucrisa. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded 
$698 million as the fair value of notes payable in cash, and recorded $4.9 billion 
in Identifiable intangible assets , primarily consisting of $4.8 billion of IPR&D , and recorded $646 million of Goodwill and $346 million of net income tax liabilities. The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed.
Hospira, Inc. (EH)
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for 
$90 per share incash. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Hospira was approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Hospira is a subsidiary of Pfizer and its commercial operations are included in the EH segment.
Hospira’s principal business was the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of generic acute-care and oncology injectables, biosimilars and integrated infusion
therapy and medication management systems (see 
Note 2B below). Hospira’s broad portfolio of products is used by hospitals and alternate site providers, such as clinics, home healthcare providers and long-term care facilities. We believe our acquisition of Hospira has strengthened our EH business, as EH now has a broadened portfolio of generic
and branded sterile injectables, marketed biosimilars and biosimilars in development.

Final amounts recognized as of the acquisition date, included in Current tax assets ( $57 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $58 million ), Income taxes payable ( $5 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax 
liabilities ( $3.4 billion ) and Other taxes payable ( $101 million , including accrued interest of $5 million ). As of the acquisition date, the fair value of accounts
 receivable approximated the book value acquired. The gross contractual amount receivable was $565 million , of which $12 million 
was not expected to be collected. In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurred liabilities for environmental, legal and tax matters, as well as guarantees and indemnifications. These matters may include
contingencies. Except as specifically excluded by the relevant accounting standard, contingencies are required to be measured at fair value as of
 the acquisition date if theacquisition-date fair value of the asset or liability arising from a contingency can be determined. If the acquisition-date fair value of the asset
 or liability cannot be determined,the asset or liability would be recognized at the acquisition date if both of the following criteria are met: (i) it is probable that an asset
 existed or that a liability had been incurredat the acquisition date, and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated.
•
Environmental Matters —In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurred liabilities for environmental matters such as remediation work, asset retirement obligations and environmental guarantees and indemnifications. The contingencies for environmental matters are not significant to Pfizer’s financial statements.
•
Legal Matters —Hospira is involved in various legal proceedings, including product liability, patent, commercial, antitrust and environmental matters and government investigations, of a nature considered normal to its business. The contingencies arising from legal matters are not significant to Pfizer’s financial statements.
•
Tax Matters —In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurred liabilities for income taxes . Income taxes are exceptions to both the recognition and fair valuemeasurement principles associated with the accounting for business combinations. Reserves for income tax contingencies continue to be measured under the benefit
recognition model as previously used by Hospira. Net liabilities for income taxes approximate 
$3.4 billion as of the acquisition date, which included $109 million for uncertain tax positions. The net tax liability included the recording of additional adjustments of approximately 
$3.2 billion for the tax impact of fair value adjustments and approximately $719 million 
for income tax matters that we intend to resolve in a manner different from what Hospira had planned or intended. For example, because we planned torepatriate certain overseas funds, we provided deferred taxes on Hospira’s unremitted earnings for which no taxes had been previously provided by Hospira as it was
Hospira’s intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings.
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the 
future economic benefits arising from other assetsacquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Hospira includes the following:
•
the expected specific synergies and other benefits that we believe will result from combining the operations of Hospira with the operations of Pfizer;•
any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, as well as future, as yet unidentified projects and products; and•
the value of the going-concern element of Hospira’s existing businesses (the higher rate of return on the assembled collection of net assets versus if Pfizer had acquired all ofthe net assets separately).
Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill related to the acquisition of Hospira is related to our EH segment
 (see Note 10 for additional information).

  1.23 The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and do not purport to reflect what the
 combinedcompany’s results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014, nor do they project the 
future results of operations of the combinedcompany or reflect the expected realization of any cost savings associated with the acquisition. The actual results o
f operations of the combined company may differsignificantly from the pro forma adjustments reflected here due to many factors. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information includes various assumptions,
including those related to the purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Hospira.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results reflect the historical financial information of Pfizer and Hospira, adjusted to give effect to the
 acquisition of Hospiraas if it had occurred on January 1, 2014, primarily for the following pre-tax adjustments in 2015:
•
Elimination of Hospira’s historical intangible asset amortization expense (approximately $33 million ). •
Additional amortization expense (approximately $342 million ) related to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired. •
Additional depreciation expense (approximately $52 million ) related to the fair value adjustment to PP&E acquired. •
Adjustment related to the non-recurring fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory estimated to have been sold (the elimination of $364 million of charges). •
Adjustment to decrease interest expense (approximately $18 million ) related to the fair value adjustment of Hospira debt. •
Adjustment for non-recurring acquisition-related costs directly attributable to the acquisition (the elimination of $877 million of charges), reflecting non-recurring charges incurred by both Hospira and Pfizer which would have been recorded in 2014 under the pro forma assumption that the Hospira acquisition was completed on January 1,
2014.
The above adjustments were adjusted for the applicable tax impact. The taxes associated with the adjustments
 related to the fair value adjustment for acquired intangibleassets, PP&E, inventory and debt reflect 
the statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions where the adjustments are expected to be incurred. The taxes associated withelimination of Hospira’s historical intangible asset amortization expense and the adjustment for the acquisition-related costs directly attributable to the acquisition were based on
the tax rate in the jurisdiction in which the related deductible costs were incurred.
Marketed Vaccines Business of Baxter International Inc. (IH)
On December 1, 2014 (which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 for our international operations), we acquired Baxter 
’ s portfolio of marketed vaccines for a final purchaseprice of 
$648 million . The portfolio that was acquired consists of NeisVac-C and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac. NeisVac-C is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group C meningococcal meningitis and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac is a vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis. In connection with this acquisition, we
recorded 
$376 million in Identifiable intangible assets, primarily consisting of $371 million in Developed technology rights. We also recorded $194 million of Inventories and $12million 
in Goodwill . The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed. B. Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems 
Net Assets to ICU Medical, Inc. (EH)On October 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into
 a definitive agreement under which ICU Medical agreed to acquire all of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS,for approximately 
$1 billion in cash and ICU Medical common stock. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions, and devices. As a result o f the performance of HIS relative to ICUMedical’s expectations, on January 5, 2017 we entered into a revised agreement with ICU Medical under which ICU Medical would acquire HIS for up to approximately 
$900 million 
, composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. The revised transaction closed on February 3, 2017. At closing, under the terms of the
 revised agreement, we received 3.2 million newly issued shares of ICU Medical common stock (as originally agreed), which we initially valued at approximately 
$428 million (based upon the 90

closing price of ICU Medical common stock on the closing date less a discount for lack of marketability) and which are reported as available-for-sale equity securities at fair
value in 
Long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, a promissory note in the amount o f $75 million , which was repaid in full as of December 31, 2017, and net cash of approximately 
$200 million before customary adjustments for net working capital, which is reported in Other investing activities, net on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year-ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we are en
titled to receive a contingent amount of up to an additional $225 million in cash based on ICU Medical’s achievement of certain cumulative performance targets for the combined company through December 31, 2019. After receipt of ICU Medical
shares, we own approximately 
16% of ICU Medical. We have agreed to certain restrictions on transfer of our ICU Medical shares for 18 months after the closing date . Werecognized pre-tax losses of approximately 
$55 million in 2017 in Other (income)/deductions––net, representing adjustments to amounts previously recorded in 2016 to write down the HIS net assets to fair value less costs to
 sell. For additional information, see Note 4 . While we have received the full purchase price excluding the contingent amount as of the February 3, 2017 closing, the sale o
f the HIS net assets was not completed in certainnon-U.S. jurisdictions due to temporary regulatory or operational constraints. In these jurisdictions, which represent a relatively small portion of the HIS net assets, we have
continued to operate the net assets for the ne
t economic benefit of ICU Medical, and we are indemnified by ICU Medical against risks associated with such operations duringthe interim period, subject to our obligations under the definitive transaction agreements. Sales of the HIS ne
t assets have occurred in certain of these jurisdictions as ofDecember 31, 2017 and we expect the sale of the HIS net
 assets in the remaining jurisdictions to be fully completed by the first quarter of 2018. As such, and as we havealready received all of the non-contingent proceeds from the sale and ICU Medical is contractually obligated to complete the transaction, we have treated these
 jurisdictions assold for accounting purposes.
In connection with the sale transaction, we entered into certain transitional agreements designed to facilitate the orderly transition of 
the HIS net assets to ICU Medical. Theseagreements primarily relate to administrative services, which are generally to be provided for a period of up to 24 months after the closing date. We will also manufacture and
supply certain HIS products for ICU Medical and ICU Medical will manufacture and supply certain retained Pfizer products for us after closing, generally for a term of five years.
These agreements are not material to Pfizer and none confers upon us the ability to influence the
 operating and/or financial policies of ICU Medical subsequent to the sale.At 
December 31, 2016 , we determined that the carrying value of the HIS net assets  held for sale exceeded their fair value less estimated costs to sell, resulting in a pre-taximpairment charge of 
$1.7 billion , which is included in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ). The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to future cash flows to be generated by HIS, primarily as a result of an increase in competition for customer contracts and pricing factors that
 were not initially anticipated.Assets and liabilities associated with HIS are presented as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2016 . The HIS assets held for sale are reported in 
Assets held for sale and HIS liabilities held for sale are reported in Other current liabilities . The amounts associated with HIS, as well as other assets classified as held for sale consisted of the following:

 Other assets held for sale consist primarily of PP&E and other assets.C. Research and Development and Collabo
rative ArrangementsResearch and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund II, L.P.
On November 1, 2016, we announced the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for bococizumab. During December 2016, 
$31.3 million was refunded to NovaQuest representing amounts NovaQuest prepaid for development costs (under the May 2016 agreement described below) that were not used for program expenses due
to the discontinuation of the development program. No additional payments have been or are expected to be
 received from or paid to NovaQuest under this agreement, whichwas effectively terminated on November 18, 2016.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
In May 2016, our agreement with NovaQuest became effective, under which NovaQuest agreed to 
fund up to $250 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s bococizumab compound and Pfizer agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound.
NovaQuest’s development funding was expected to cover up to 
40% of the development costs and was to be received over five quarters during 2016 and 2017. As there was asubstantive and genuine transfer of risk to NovaQuest, the development funding applicable to program expenses during 2016 was recognized as an obligation to
 performcontractual services and therefore has been recognized as a reduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses 
for 2016 totaled $180.3 million . Research and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund V, L.P.
In April 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with NovaQuest under which NovaQuest will fund up to 
$200 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s rivipansel compound and Pfizer will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound. NovaQuest’s
development funding is expected to cover up to 
100% of the development costs and will be received over approximately 12 quarters from 2016 to 2019. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to NovaQuest, the development funding is recognized by us
 as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is areduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses totaled $72.1 million for 2017 and $46.6 million for 2016. Following potential regulatory approval, NovaQuest will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to approximately 
$267 million in total, based on achievement of first commercial sale and certain levels of cumulative net sales as well as royalties on rivipansel net sales over approximately eight years. Fixed sales-based
milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets over the estimated commercial life of the rivipansel product and royalties on net sales will be recorded as 
Cost of sales when incurred. Research and Development Arrangement with RPI Finance Trust
In January 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with RPI, a subsidiary of Royalty Pharma, under which RPI
 will fund up to $300 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s Ibrance (palbociclib) product primarily for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive early breast cancer (the Indication). RPI’s
development funding is expected to cover up to 
100% of the costs primarily for the applicable clinical trials through 2021. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to RPI, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is a
 reduction of Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to 
Research and development expenses totaled $75.6 million for 2017 and $44.9 million for 2016. If successful and upon approval of Ibrance in the U. S.or certain major markets in the EU for the Indication based on the applicable clinical trials, RPI will be eligible to receive a combination of approval-based fixed milestone
payments of up to 
$250 million dependent upon results of the clinical trials and royalties on certain Ibrance sales over approximately seven years. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets over the estimated commercial life of the Ibrance product and sales- based royalties will be recorded as 
Cost of sales when incurred. Collaborative Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of
research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or
commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the ac
tivity. Our rights andobligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and we
have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.
The following table provides the amounts and classification of payments (income/(expense)) between us and our collaboration partners:

The amounts disclosed in the above table do not include transactions with third parties other than our collaboration partners, or other costs associated
 with the products underthe collaborative arrangements.
In addition, in connection with our collaborative arrangements, we paid post-approval milestones to collaboration partners of 
$140 million in 2017 related to our collaboration with Merck KGaA (see below) and 
$20 million in 2015 . These payments were recorded in Identifiable intangible assets –– Developed technology rights. We did not pay post- approval milestones to collaboration partners in 2016. We also recorded upfront and milestone payments from our collaboration partners of 
$150 million in 2017 , related to our collaboration with Merck and 
$200 million in 2015, related to our collaboration with Lilly (see below). These amounts were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue and are being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period. Collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc.
In 2013, we announced that we entered into a worldwide collaboration agreement, except for Japan, with Merck for the development and
 commercialization of ertugliflozin (PF-04971729), our oral sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Under the agreement, we collaborated with Merck on the clinical
development of ertugliflozin, and ertugliflozin-containing fixed-dose combinations with metformin and Januvia (sitagliptin) tablets which were approved by the FDA in December
2017 as Steglatro, Segluromet and Steglujan, respectively.
In the first quarter of 
2017 , we received a $90 million milestone payment from Merck upon the FDA’s acceptance for review of the NDAs for ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combinations (ertugliflozin plus Januvia (sitagliptin) and ertugliflozin plus metformin), which has been deferred and primarily repo
rted in Other noncurrent liabilities and is being recognized in 
Other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period. We are eligible for additional payments associated with the achievement of future regulatory and commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2017, we were due a 
$60 million milestone payment from Merck in conjunction with the approval of ertugliflozin by the FDA, which we received in the first quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the 
$60 million due from Merck has been deferred and primarily reported in Other noncurrent liabilities . The Merck sales force will exclusively promote Steglatro and the two fixed-dose combination products and we will share revenues and certain costs with Merck on a 
60% / 40%basis, with Pfizer having the 
40% share. Pfizer will record its share of the collaboration revenues as product sales as we supply the ertugliflozin active pharmaceutical ingredient to Merck for use in the alliance products.
Collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company
In 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize Pfizer’s tanezumab, which provides that Pfizer and Lilly will equally
share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. Following the decision by the FDA in March 2015 to lift the partial clinical
hold on the tanezumab development program, we received a 
$200 million upfront payment from Lilly in accordance with the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Lilly, which is recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Pfizer and Lilly resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab in July 2015. The FDA
 granted Fast Track designation for tanezumabfor the treatment of chronic pain in patients with OA and CLBP
 in June 2017. Under the collaboration agreement with Lilly, we are eligible to receive additional payments fromLilly upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones.
Collaboration with OPKO Health, Inc.
We entered into a collaborative agreement with OPKO, which closed in January 2015, to develop and commercialize OPKO’s long-acting hGH-CTP for the 
treatment of GHD inadults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born SGA who fail to show catch-up growth by 
two years of age. In February 2015, we made anupfront payment of 
$295 million to OPKO, which was recorded in Research and development expenses, and OPKO is eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OPKO is also eligible to receive royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD, which is
subject to regulatory approval. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval, the royalties will transition to tiered gross profit sharing
for both hGH-CTP and our product, Genotropin.
Collaboration with Merck KGaA
In November 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, the proposed international non-proprietary
name for the investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody (MSB0010718C), currently approved as Bavencio for metastatic MCC and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC
in certain countries and in development as a potential treatment for multiple other types of cancer. We and Merck K
GaA are exploring the therapeutic potential of this novel anti-PD-L1 antibody as a single agent as well as in various combinations with our and Merck KGaA’s broad portfolio of approved and investigational oncology therapies. We and
Merck KGaA are also combining resources and expertise to advance Pfizer’s anti-PD-1 antibody into Phase 1 trials and explore novel combinations. Under the terms of the
agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we made an upfront payment o
f $850 million to Merck KGaA and Merck KGaA is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately 
$2.0 billion . During 2017, we made $140 million in milestone payments to Merck KGaA, which were recorded in Identifiable intangible assets 
–– Developed technology rights, for approvals of avelumab received in 2017 for the MCC indication in the U.S., the EU and Japan, and  for the metastatic UCindication in the U.S. Both companies jointly fund all development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1
products from this collaboration. Also, as part of the agreement, we gave Merck KGaA
 certain co-promotion rights for Xalkori in the U.S. and several other key markets.2017 Financial Report

D. Equity-Method Investments
Investment in Hisun Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Company Limited
In September 2012, we and Hisun, a leading pharmaceutical company in China, formed a new company, Hisun Pfizer, to develop, manufacture, market and sell pharmaceutical
products, primarily branded generic products, predominately in China. Hisun Pfizer was established with registered capital of 
$250 million , of which our portion was $122.5 million 
. As a result of the contributions from both parties, Hisun Pfizer holds a broad port folio of branded generics covering cardiovascular disease, infectious disease,oncology, mental health and other therapeutic areas.
We have accounted for our interest in Hisun Pfizer as an equity-method investment, due to 
the significant influence we have had over the operations of Hisun Pfizer through ourboard representation, minority veto rights and 
49% voting interest. Our investment in Hisun Pfizer has been reported in Long-term investments , and our share of Hisun Pfizer’s net income has been recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net. On November 10, 2017, we sold our 
49% equity share in Hisun Pfizer to Sapphire I (HK) Holdings Limited, an investment fund managed by Hillhouse Capital, for a total of $286 million 
in cash which included our carrying value of $270 million in cash plus $16 million to cover certain taxes incurred on the transaction. As a result of the  sale transaction, werecognized a loss of 
$81 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the recognition in earnings of the currency translation adjustment associated with our investment . After the saletransaction, Hisun Pfizer will change its name but will retain its current rights to manufacture, sell and distribute all of Hisun Pfizer’s currently marketed and pipeline products in
China. We will provide technical, manufacturing and regulatory services in connection with a technology transfer process being run by Hisun Pfizer to support Hisun Pfizer’s
objective that the products that we had previously licensed to Hisun Pfizer, will in the future, be manufac
tured locally in China. We will continue to supply certain products toHisun Pfizer for a period of time, after the sale transaction, to facilitate a
 smooth transition.In 2016, we determined that we had other-than-temporary declines in the value of Hisun Pfizer, and, therefore, we recognized a loss o
f $452 million in Other(income)/deductions––net 
(see Note 4 ), consisting of losses recognized in the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016.  In the first and second quarters of 2016, we determinedthat we had other-than-temporary declines in the value of Hisun Pfizer and, therefore, we recognized a loss of 
$81 million and $130 million , respectively. The declines in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to be generated by Hisun P
fizer, primarily as a result of an increase in risk due to the continued slowdown in theChinese economy and changes in the expected timing and number of new product introductions by Hisun Pfizer. In the 
fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a loss of $241 million 
to reduce the carrying value of our investment in Hisun Pfizer to approximately $270 million at December 31, 2016. In the third quarter of 2015, we determined that we had an other-than-temporary decline in the value of Hisun P
fizer, and, therefore, in 2015, we recognized a loss of $463 million 
in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ) . The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to be generated by Hisun Pfizer, as aresult of lower than expected recent performance, increased competition, a slowdown in the China economy in relation to their products, as well as certain changes in the
regulatory environment.
In valuing our investment in Hisun Pfizer, we used discounted cash flow techniques, reflecting our best estimate of 
the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows, and anominal terminal year growth factor. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected ne
t cashflows, which include the expected impact of competitive, legal, economic and/or regulatory forces on the products; the long-term growth rate, which seeks 
to project thesustainable growth rate over the long-term; and the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash
 flows, including country risk. As ofDecember 31, 2015 
, the carrying value of our investment in Hisun Pfizer was approximately $ 775 million . Investment in Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro S.A.
We entered into an agreement on June 30, 2017 to exit our investment in Teu
to, a 40% -owned generics company in Brazil, and sell our 40% interest in Teuto to the majority shareholders. As part of the agreement, we have waived our option to acquire the remaining 
60% of Teuto, and Teuto’s other shareholders have waived their option to sell their 60% 
stake in the company to us. As a result, in the  second quarter of 2017, we recognized a net loss of approximately $30 million in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 
), which included the impairment of our equity-method investment in Teuto, the reversal of a contingent liability associated with the majority shareholders’ option to sell their60% 
stake in the company to us, and the recognition in earnings of the currency translation adjustment associated  with the Teuto investment. The transaction closed on August16, 2017.
In 2016, we determined that we had an other-than-temporary decline in the value of Teuto, and,
 therefore, in 2016, we recognized a loss of $50 million in Other(income)/deductions––net 
(see Note 4 ) related to our equity-method investment. The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to  begenerated by Teuto, primarily due to a slowdown in Brazilian economic conditions, which have been impacted by political risk, higher inflation, and the depreciation of the
Brazilian Real.
In valuing our investment in Teuto, we used discounted cash flow techniques, reflecting our best estimate o
f the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows, and anominal terminal year growth factor. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected ne
t cashflows, which include the expected impact of competitive, legal, economic and/or regulatory forces on the products; the long-term growth rate, which seeks 
to project thesustainable growth rate over the long-term; and the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash
 flows, including country risk.94

E. Cost-Method Investment
AM-Pharma B.V.
In April 2015, we acquired a minority equity interest in AM-Pharma, a privately-held Dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of recAP for inflammatory
diseases, and secured an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in the company. The option becomes exercisable after completion of a Phase 
II trial of recAP in thetreatment of Acute Kidney Injury related to sepsis, which is currently expected in the 
first quarter of 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, we originally paid $87.5 million for both the exclusive option and the minority equity interest, which was recorded as a cost-method investment in 
Long-term investments . During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a loss of 
$43 million in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ) for an impairment of our long-term investment. Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity
Initiatives
We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. For
example:
•
In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may includeexpenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees,
assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and
•
In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions,workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.
All of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as groups such as
 informationtechnology, shared services and corporate operations.
In connection with our acquisition of Hospira, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We
 expect to incur costs ofapproximately 
$1 billion (not including costs of $215 million in 2015 associated with the return of acquired IPR&D rights as described in the Current-Period Key Activities section below) associated with the integration of Hospira. The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred for the 
three-year period post-acquisition.In 2016, we substantially completed previously disclosed cost-reduction initiatives begun in 2014 associated with our global commercial structure reorganization, manufacturing
plant network rationalization and optimization initiatives, and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives across the enterprise.
As a result of the evaluation performed in connection with our decision in September 2016 to not pursue, a
t that time, splitting IH and EH into two separate publicly-tradedcompanies, we identified new opportunities to potentially achieve greater optimization and efficiency to become more competitive in our business. Therefore, in early 
2017 , we initiated new enterprise-wide cost reduction/productivity initiatives, which we expect to substantially complete by the end of 2019. These initiatives will encompass all areas of
our cost base and will include:
•
Optimization of our manufacturing plant network to support IH and EH products and pipelines. During 2017-2019, we expect to incur costs of approximately $800 million related to this initiative. Through 
December 31, 2017 , we incurred approximately $197 million associated with this initiative. •
Activities in non-manufacturing related areas, which include further centralization of our corporate and platform functions, as well as other activities where opportunities areidentified. During 2017-2019, we expect to incur costs of approximately 
$300 million related to this initiative. Through December 31, 2017 , we incurred approximately $151 million 
associated with this initiative. The costs expected to be incurred during 2017-2019, of approximately 
$1.1 billion for the above-mentioned programs (but not including expected costs associated with the Hospira integration), include restructuring charges, implementation costs and additional depreciation––asset restructuring. Of this amount, we expect that about 
20% of the total charges will be non-cash.
Current-Period Key Activities
In 
2017 , we incurred costs of $348 million associated with the 2017-2019 program, $319 million associated with the integration of Hospira and $137 million associated with all other acquisition-related initiatives.

In 2017 , restructuring charges are primarily associated with our acquisitions of Hospira and Medivation, as well as cost-reduction and productivity initiatives not associated with acquisitions. In 2016 , restructuring charges are largely associate
d with cost-reduction and productivity initiatives not associated with acquisitions, as well as our acquisitions of Hospira and Medivation. In 2015, restructuring charges are largelyassociated with.cost-reduction a
nd productivity initiatives not associated with acquisitions. In 2017 , Employee terminations primarily include revisions of our estim ates of severance benefits. Employee terminationcosts are generally recorded w
hen the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods aftertermination.
The restructuring activities in 
2017 are associated with the  following:•
IH ( $64 million income); EH ( $4 million income); WRD/GPD ( $80 million ); manufacturing operations ( $115 million ); and Corporate ( $51 million ). The restructuring activities in 
2016 are associated with the  following:•
IH ( $272 million ); EH ( $158 million ); WRD/GPD ( $169 million ); manufacturing operations ( $368 million ); and Corporate ( $189 million ), The restructuring activities in 
2015 , which include a $39 million charge related to a 36% reduction in our labor force i n Venezuela, are associated with the following:•
IH ( $85 million ); EH ( $402 million ); WRD/GPD ( $80 million ); manufacturing operations ( $80 million ); and Corporate ( $164 million ). In September 2015, in ord
er to eliminate certain redundancies in Pfizer’s biosimilar drug products pipeline created as a result of the acquisition of Hospira, Pfizer opted to return rights to Celltrion that Hospira hadpreviously acquired to pote
ntial biosimilars to Rituxan® (rituximab) and Herceptin® (trastuzumab). As such, upon return of the acquired rights, in 2015, we incurred charges of $215 million , which are comprised of (i) a write-off of the applicable IPR&D ass
ets, totaling $170 million , which is included in Asset impairments ; (ii) a write-off of amounts prepaid t o Celltrion in the amount of $25 million , which is included in Asset impairments 
; and (iii) a payment to Celltrion of $20 million , which is included in Exit costs . (b)
 
The asset impairment charges for 2017 are largely associated with our acquisitions of Hospira and Medivation. The asset impairment charges included in restructuring charges for 2017 and 2016 are primarilyassociated with abandoned asse
ts. The asset impairment charges for 2015 are primarily associated with our ac quisition of Hospira. See (a) above for additional information.(c)
 
Transaction costs represent external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services, which in 2017 are directly related to our acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor and Medivation. Transaction costs in2016 are mostly related to o
ur acquisitions of Medivation and Anacor, and the terminated transaction with Allergan. Transaction costs in 2015 represent external costs directly related to the acquisition of Hospiraand the terminated transacti
on with Allergan and primarily include expenditures for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services.(d)
 
I ntegration costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes. In 2017 , integration costs primarily relate to 
our acquisitions of Hospira and Medivation, as well as a net gain of $12 million related to the settlement of th e Hospira U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (see Note 11 ). In 2016, integration costs prim
arily relate to our acquisition of Hospira and the terminated transaction with Allergan. Integration costs in 2015 represent external incremental costs directly related to our acquisition ofHospira.
(e) 
 Additional depreciation––asset restructuring represents the impact of changes in the estimated useful lives of assets involved in restructuring actions.(f) 
 Implementation costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to implementing our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.96

all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significantestimates and assumptions inh
erent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the product;the discount rate, which seeks to r
eflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.98

2017 v. 2016 –– The decrease in the domestic loss was primarily due to lower restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs, the non-recurrence of the 2016 impairment on the remeasurement of HISnet assets, lower certain asset impairm
ents and lower certain legal matters, partially offset by higher net losses on early retirement of debt, and higher amortization of intangible assets. The increase in internationalincome was primarily due to the n
on-recurrence of the 2016 impairment on the remeasurement of HIS net assets, lower restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs, and lower certain assetimpairments.
(b)
 
2016 v. 2015 –– The increase in the domestic loss was primarily due to a charge related to the write-down of HIS net assets to fair value less estimated costs to sell, higher asset impairments, and higherrestructuring charges and cert
ain acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of legacy U.S. Hospira operations as compared to four months of U.S. operations in 2015, and lower chargesfor legal matters. The increase in int

 the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an estimate of certain tax effects of the TCJA, including the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities from the reduction in thecorporate
 tax rate from 35% to 21% ,  the impact on valuation allowances and other state income tax considerations, the $15.2  billion repatriation  tax liability on accumulatedpost-1986 foreig
n earnings for which we plan to elect payment over eight years through 2026 (with the first of eight installments due in April 2019) that is reported in Other taxes payable 
, and deferred taxes on  basis differences expected to give rise to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, we had provided deferred tax liabilitiesin
 the past on foreign earnings that were not indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we reversed an estimate of the deferred taxes that are no longer expected to beneeded
 due  to  the  change  to  the  territorial  tax  system.  The  estimated  amounts  recorded  may  change  in  the  future  due  to  uncertain  tax  positions.  With  respect  to  theaforementioned
 repatriation tax liability related to the TCJA repatriation tax, our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability ofattributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.
The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staf
f Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5,Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income 
, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes  for temporary basisdifferences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the
 tax is incurred. Wehave elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years. However, given the complexity of
these provisions, we have not finalized our analysis. We were able to make a reasonable estimate of the deferred taxes on 
the temporary differences expected to reverse in thefuture and provided a provisional deferred tax liability of approximately 
$1 billion as of December 31, 2017. The provisional amount is based on the evaluation of certain temporary differences inside each of our foreign subsidiaries that are expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income. However, as we continue to evaluate the
TCJA’s global intangible low-taxed income provisions during the measurement period, we may revise the methodology used for determining the deferred tax liability associated
with such income.
We
 believe that we have made reasonable estimates with respect to each of the above items, however, all of the amounts recorded are provisional as we have not completedour
 analysis of the complex and far reaching effects of the TCJA. Further, we continue to consider our assertions on any remaining outside basis differences in our foreignsubsidiaries
 as of December 31, 2017 and have not completed our analysis. Under guidance issued by the staff of the SEC, we expect to finalize our accounting related to thetax
 effects of the TCJA on deferred taxes, valuation allowances, state tax considerations, the repatriation tax liability, global intangible low-taxed income, and any remainingoutside
 basis differences  in our foreign subsidiaries during 2018 as we complete our analysis, computations  and assertions.  It is possible that others, applying reasonablejudgment to
2017 Financial Report

the
 same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We will revise these estimates during 2018 as we gather additionalinformation to complete our tax returns and as any interpretation or clarification of the TCJA occurs through legislation, U.S. Treasury actions or other means.
In 
2017 , the Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income was impacted by the following: •
estimated U.S. net tax benefits of $10.7 billion associated with the enactment of the TCJA (see discussion above), primarily reflecting: ◦
$22.8 billion tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (see Note 5C ); ◦
$1.6 billion tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of other U.S. deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with intangibles (see Note 5C ); ◦
$12.9 billion tax expense related to the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated pre-2017 post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries; ◦
$1.0 billion tax expense related to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income (see Note 5C ); and ◦
approximately $100 million tax benefit primarily associated with certain tax initiatives; •
U.S. tax expense of approximately $1.3 billion related to the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated current year earnings of foreign subsidiaries; •
tax benefit of approximately $370 million related to net losses on early retirement of debt; •
tax benefits of approximately $150 million representing tax and interest resulting from the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations; and
•
the non-deductibility of a $307 million fee payable to the federal government as a result of the U.S . Healthcare Legislation.In 
2016 , the Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income was impacted by the following: •
U.S. tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion as a result of providing U.S. deferred income taxes on certain funds earned outside the U.S . that will not be indefinitelyreinvested overseas, virtually all of which were earned in 2016 (see 
Note 5C ); •
tax benefits of approximately $460 million , representing tax and interest, resulting from the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years, primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations;
•
benefits related to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve certain claims related to Protonix, whichresulted in the receipt of information that raised our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position;
•
net tax benefits of $89 million , related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in the  fourth quarter of 2016, as of January 1, 2016, requiring excess tax benefits ordeficiencies of share-based compensation to be recognized as a component of the 
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in Pfizer’s 2016 Financial Report); •
the non-deductibility of a $312 million fee payable to the federal government as a result of the U.S . Healthcare Legislation; and•
the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which was signed into law in December 2015.In 
2015 , the Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income was impacted by the following: •
U.S. tax expense of approximately $2.1 billion as a result of providing U.S. deferred income taxes on certain funds earned outside the U.S . that will not be indefinitelyreinvested overseas, virtually all of which were earned in 2015 (see 
Note 5C ); •
tax benefits of approximately $360 million , representing tax and interest, resulting from the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years, primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations;
•
the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which was signed into law in December 2015, as well as tax benefits associated with certain tax initiatives;•
the non-deductibility of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela;•
the non-deductibility of a charge for the agreement in principle reached in February 2016 to resolve claims relating to Protonix; and•
the non-deductibility of a $251 million fee payable to the federal government as a result of the U.S . Healthcare Legislation.In all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in 
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income (see

B. Tax Rate Reconciliation
The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our ef
fective tax rate for Income from continuing operations  follows:

  (73.5 )%  13.4  % 22.2  %(a) 
 For a discussion about the enactment of the TCJA, see Note 5A. (b)
 
For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the cost of repatriation decisions, whichincludes the repatriation tax 
on deemed repatriated current year earnings of foreign subsidiaries discussed in Note 5A , as well as changes in uncertai n tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Taxsettlements and resolution of c
ertain tax positions”. Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year as tax rates outside the U.S. are generally lowerthan the U.S. statutory income tax rat
e, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the costof repatriation decisions, an
d other U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations, is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generally offsets some of the reduction to our effective tax rateeach year resulting from the juris
dictional location of earnings; and (iii) the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain taxpositions” is a component of o
ur effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location ofearnings as well as repatriatio
n costs, can vary as a result of the repatriation decisions, as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and as a result of the extent and location of otherincome and expense items, suc
h as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategic business decisions. See also Note 5A for the components of pre -tax income and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, 
which is based on the locatio n of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements and other items impacting Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income . (c)
 
In all periods presented, the reduction in our effective tax rate resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings is largely due to generally lower tax rates, as well as manufacturing and other incentives associatedwith our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico 
and Singapore. 2015 and 2016 also include incentives in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic related to the Hospira infusion systems business, which was sold to ICUMedical in February 2017. We be
nefit from a Puerto Rican incentive grant that expires in 2029. Under the grant, we are partially exempt from income, property and municipal taxes. In Singapore, we benefit fromincentive tax rates e
ffective through 2031 on income from manufacturing and other operations.(d)
 
The favorable rate impact in 2017 also reflects lower repatriation costs associated with estimated current year income of our foreign subsidiaries. The favorable rate impact in 2016 also includes the non-recu rrenceof the non-deductibility of a f
oreign currency loss related to Venezuela. The rate impact in 2015 also includes the non-de ductibility of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela.(e)

2017 reflects the estimated remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as the result of the enactment of the TCJA. For additional information, see Note 5A . (a)
 
The decrease in 2017 is primarily the result of the enactme nt of the TCJA, which includes the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities primarily associated with intangible assets and unremitted earnings of foreignsubsidiaries as well as amortization 
on intangible assets. For additional information, see Note 5A. (b)
 
The amounts in 2017 and 2016 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.4 billion and $3.0 billion , respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax creditcarryforwards that are available, 
under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.(c)
 
The amount in 2017 primarily includes a provisional estimate on temporary differences associated with global intangible low-taxed income primarily related to basis differentials on intangibles. For additionalinformation, see 
Note 5A. (d)
 
In 2017 , Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $0.7 billion ), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $3.9 billion ). In 2016 , Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent taxassets 
( $654 million ), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $30.8 billion ). We have carryforwards, primarily related to foreign tax credits, net operating and capital losses and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S. federal
and state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2018 to 2037. Certain of our U.S
. net operating losses aresubject to limitations under IRC Section 382.
Valuation allowances are provided when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future 
taxable income thatincorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax asse
ts.We have not completed our analysis of the TCJA on our prior assertion of indefinitely reinvested earnings. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our assertion with respect 
to ouraccumulated foreign earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax and we also continue to evaluate the amount o
f earnings that are indefinitely reinvested. Additionally, wecontinue to evaluate our assertions on any remaining outside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 as we have not finalized our analysis of the
effects of all of the new provisions in the TCJA. As o
f December 31, 2017, it is not practicable to estimate the additional deferred tax liability that would be recorded if theearnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax and any remaining outside basis differences as of December 31, 2017 are not indefinitely reinvested. In
 accordance with theauthoritative guidance issued by the SEC Staff Accounting 
Bulletin 118, we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period.D. Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax
positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and
 theresolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have
 beendeemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax bene
fits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation fromsuch estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the sta
tutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items inthe period of resolution.

Uncertain Tax Positions
As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax
 positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
, we had approximately $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion , respectively, in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest. •
Tax assets associated with uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment ofincome taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to
 minimizedouble taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets,
 which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependentupon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, 
the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
, we had approximately $1.2 billion , in each year, in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. In 2017 , these amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets 
( $1.0 billion ) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $118 million ). In 2016 , these amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets 
( $1.0 billion ) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $201 million ). •
Tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions represent unrecognized tax benefits, which arise when the estimated benefit recorded in our financial statements differsfrom the amounts taken or expected to be taken in a 
tax return because of the uncertainties described above. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issuescommon among multinational corporations. Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.
The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:

Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income 
in our consolidated statements of income. In 2017 , we recorded a net increase in interest of $208 million . In 2016 , we recorded a net increase in interest of $72 million 
; and in 2015 , we recorded a net increase in interest of $71 million . Gross accrued interest totaled $975 million as of December 31, 2017 (reflecting a decrease of approximately 
$4 million as a result of cash payments) and gross accrued interest totaled $771 million as of December 31, 2016 (reflecting a decrease of approximately $18 million 
as a result of cash payments). In 2017 , this amount was included in Other taxes payable ( $975 million ). In 2016 , these amounts were included in Income taxes payable 
( $4 million ), Current tax asset s ( $13 million ) and Other taxes payable ( $754 million ). Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A. Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact
 on Accruals for Uncertain Tax PositionsThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS:
•
With respect to Pfizer, the IRS has issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) for tax years 2009-2010. We are not in agreement with the RAR and are currently appealingcertain disputed issues. Tax years 2011-2013 are currently under audit. Tax years 2014-2017 are open, but not under audit. 
All other tax years are closed.•
With respect to Hospira, the federal income tax audit of tax years 2012-2013 was effectively settled in the third quarter of 2017. The IRS is currently auditing tax year 2014through short-year 2015. All other tax years are closed. The tax years under audit for Hospira are not considered material to Pfizer.
•
With respect to Anacor and Medivation, the open tax years are not considered material to Pfizer.In addition to the open audit years in the U.S.,
 we have open audit years in other major tax jurisdictions, such as Canada (2010-2017), Japan (2015-2017), Europe (2011-2017,primarily reflecting Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Latin America (1998-2017, primarily reflecting Brazil) and Puerto Rico (2010-2017).
Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate 
that it is reasonably possible that within thenext 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as
 much as2017 Financial Report

, as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the  statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions thathave been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and poten
tial tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, andvariation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statu
tes of limitations expire, as we treat these events asdiscrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is
difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and
 such changes could be significant.E. Tax Provision/(Benefit) on Other

, and short-termborrowings not measured at fair value on a recurring basis were not significant as of 
December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016 . The fair value measurements of our held-to- maturity debt securities and our short-term borrowings are based on Level 2 inputs, using a market approach. The fair value measurements of our private equity securities
carried at cost, which represent investments in the life sciences sector, are based on Level 3 inputs using a market approach.
In addition, as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had long-term receivables where the determination of fair value employs discounted future cash flows, using current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the differences between the estimated fair values and carrying values of these receivables were not significant.
There were no significant impairments of financial assets recognized in any period presented.

The following inputs and valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:
•
Trading equity securities—quoted market prices.•
Trading debt securities—quoted market prices.•
Available-for-sale debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedinterest rate yield curves. Receivable-backed, loan-backed, and mortgage-backed debt securities are valued by third-party models that use significant inputs derived from
observable market data like prepayment rates, default rates, and recovery rates.
•
Available-for-sale equity securities—third-party pricing services that principally use a composite of observable prices.•
Derivative assets and liabilities (financial instruments)—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Where applicable, these models discount future cash flow amounts using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices
for currencies. The credit risk impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.
•
Held-to-maturity debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedinterest rate yield curves.
•
Available-for-sale money market funds—observable net asset value prices.•
Private equity securities, excluding equity-method investments—application of the implied volatility associated with an observable biotech index to the carrying amount ofour portfolio.

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and our owncredit rating.
We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other
third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like LIBOR interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial
instruments.

In December 2017, Pfizer exchanged approximately £ 833 million principal amount of the ou tstanding 6.50% debt due 2038 for £ 1.376 billion principal amount of 2.735% debt due 2043. This exchange constituteda debt extinguishment. See t
he following “Retirements” section for the income statement impact from the extinguishment.(c) 
 The notes, issued in U.S. dollars in Taiwan, are redeemable, at our option, in whole but not in part, on each March 17 on or after March 17, 2020.On November 21, 2016, we completed a public offering of 
$6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes: $1.0 billion of notes due 2019; $1.0 billion of notes due 2021; 
$1.75 billion of notes due 2026; $1.0 billion of notes due 2036; and $1.25 billion of notes due 2046, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.10% . On June 3, 2016, we completed a public offering of 
$5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 2.09% . Acquisition of Hospira Debt
On September 3, 2015, the Hospira acquisition date, our long-term debt increased due to the addition o
f an aggregate principal amount of$1,750 million 
of legacy Hospira debt, recorded at acquisition-date fair value of $1,928 million . In October 2015, Pfizer exchanged 
$1.7 billion debt of its then recently acquired subsidiary, Hospira, for virtually the same amount of Pfizer debt with the same interest  rate andmaturity terms as the Hospira debt, leaving a minor amount of outstanding debt in Hospira’s name that
was redeemed during the fourth quarter of 2016. In connection with the exchange of
fers, the indenture governing the Hospira notes and theHospira notes were amended to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants. The net income effect
 of thisexchange was immaterial.
Retirements
In December 2017, we exchanged approximately 
£833 million and repurchased £197 million principal amount of the outstanding 6.50% debt before the maturity date at a redemption value of 
£1.7 billion , leaving £470 million principal amount of the 6.50% debt due 2038 outstanding. Also, in December 2017, we repurchased approximately €834 million 
principal amount of the outstanding 5.75% debt before the maturity date at a redemption value of €1.0 billion , leaving approximately €1.2 billion of the 5.75% euro- denominated debt due 2021 outstanding. As a result, we recorded a net loss o
f approximately $846 million and $153 million upon the exchange and early retirement of the U.K. pound-denominated debt and the early retirement of the euro-denominated debt, respectively, for a net loss on early retirement of debt
 of $999 million . which included the related termination of cross-currency swaps, and that were recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 4 ). In November 2016, we repurchased 
$3.4 billion carrying value of outstanding debt before the maturity date at a redemption value of $3.7 billion . The debt repurchased included $3.27 billion 
carrying value of 6.20% senior notes due March 2019. As a result, we recorded a total net loss of approximately $312 million upon the early redemption of debt, which included the related termination of interest rate swaps, and which was recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 4 ). 108

E. Other Noncurrent Liabilities
In December 2017, the U.S. approved Bosulif (bosutinib) for the treatment of pa
tients with newly-diagnosed chronic-phase Ph+ CML. In connection with the U.S. approval, weincurred an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over a ten-year period aggregating 
$416 million related to a research and development arrangement. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded the estimated net present value of 
$364 million as an intangible asset in Developed technology rights , and we have recorded the present value of the remaining future payments of 
$281 million in Other noncurrent liabilities and $83 million in Other current liabilities as of December 31, 2017. In August 2017, the U.S. approved Besponsa
 (inotuzumab ozogamicin) and in June 2017, the EU approved Besponsa as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsedor refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In connection with the U.S. approval, we incurred an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual
payments over a nine-year period aggregating 
$296 million related to a research and development arrangement. As a result, during the third quarter of 2017 we recorded the estimated net present value of 
$248 million as an intangible asset in Developed technology rights , and we have recorded the present value of the remaining future payments of $236 million 
in Other noncurrent liabilities and $15 million in Other current liabilities as of December 31, 2017. In connection with the EU approval, we incurred an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over a nine-year period aggregating 
$148 million related to a research and development arrangement. As a result, during the second quarter of 2017 we recorded the estimated net present value of 
$123 million as an intangible asset in Developed technology rights , and we have recorded the present value of the remaining future payments of 
$119 million in Other noncurrent liabilities and $6 million in Other current liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The differences between the estimated fair values, using a market approach in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy, and carrying values of the obligations were not significant as
 ofDecember 31, 2017.
F. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging 
ActivitiesForeign Exchange Risk
A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. We manage our foreign exchange risk,in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency
liabilities. We also manage our foreign exchange risk, depending on market conditions, through fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedging programs through the use of
derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to protect net income against the impact of remeasurement into another currency,
or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.
2017 Financial Report    
 
 109
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
All derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and are reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. Changes in fair value are reported in
earnings or in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) , depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset  relationship) and the effectiveness of thehedge relationships, as follows:
•
We recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of thehedged risk. We recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact attributable to the hedged
 item also in earnings.•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) the effective portion of the gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges andreclassify those amounts, as appropriate, into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
•
As part of our net investment hedging program, we recognize the gain and loss impact on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of our net investments inearnings in three ways: over time-for the periodic net swap payments; immediately-to the extent of any change in the difference be
tween the foreign exchange spot rate andforward rate; and upon sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments-to the extent of
 change in the foreign exchange spot rates. We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) 
the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt designated as a hedge of our ne t investments in foreign subsidiaries andreclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments.
•
For certain foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts that are used tooffset the same foreign currency assets or liabilities immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts essen
tiallytake the opposite currency position of that reflected in the month-end balance sheet
 to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.As a part of our cash flow hedging program, we designate foreign exchange contracts to hedge a
 portion of our forecasted euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, U.K. pound,Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar-denominated intercompany inventory sales expected to occur no more than two years from the date of each hedge.
Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for any period presented.
Interest Rate Risk
Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. We strive to invest and borrow primarily on a floating-rate basis; however, in light of current
market conditions, we currently borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. From time to time, depending on market conditions, we will change the profile of our
outstanding debt by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. We entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge or offset
 the fixed interestrates on the hedged item, matching the amount and timing of the hedged
 item. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.All derivative contracts used to manage interest rate risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in fair value
are reported in earnings, as follows:
•
We recognize the gains and losses on interest rate contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of thehedged risk. We recognize the offsetting earnings impact of fixed-rate debt attributable to 
the hedged risk also in earnings.Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for any period presented.

Based on year-end foreign exchange rates that are subject to change, we expect to reclassify a pre-tax loss of $72 million within the next 12 months into Cost of sales. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging future foreign ex
change cash flow relates to our $1.9 billion U.K. pound debt maturing in 2043.(e) 
 Long-term debt includes foreign currency long-term borrowings with carrying values of $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2017, which are used as hedging instruments.Certain of our derivative instruments are covered by associated credit-support agreements that have credit-risk-related contingent features designed to reduce our
counterparties’ exposure to our risk of defaulting on amounts owed. As of 
December 31, 2017 , the aggregate fair value of these derivative instruments that are in a net  liabilityposition was 
$336 million , for which we have posted collateral of $346 million in the normal course of business. If there had been a downgrade to below an A rating by  S&P orthe equivalent rating by Moody’s, we would not have been required to post any additional collateral to our counterparties.
As of 
December 31, 2017 , we received cash collateral of $226 million from various counterparties. The collateral primarily supports the approximate fair value of our derivative contracts. With respect to the collateral received, the obligations are reported in 
Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt. G. Credit Risk
On an ongoing basis, we review the creditworthiness of counterparties to our foreign exchange and interest rate agreements and do not
 expect to incur a significant loss fromfailure of any counterparties to perform under the agreements. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk related to our financial instruments with any individual
counterparty, except for certain significant customers. For additional information, see 
Note 18C . For details about our investments, see Note 7B above . In general, there is no requirement for collateral from customers. However, derivative financial instruments are executed under credit-support agreements that provide for the
ability to request collateral payments, depending on levels of exposure, our credit rating and the credit rating of the counterparty,
 see Note 7F above. 2017 Financial Report

(b)
 
The decrease in I dentifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization , is primarily due to (i) amortization, (ii) measurement period adjustments related to Medivation (see Note 2A ), as well as (iii) impairments of 
Developed technology rights (see Note 4 ), partially offset by (iv) assets acquired as part of the acquisition of AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business (see Note 2A ), (v) the assets recorded in connection with t
he EU and U.S. approvals of Besponsa and in connection with the U.S. approval of Bosulif (see Note 7E ) and (vi) the assets recorded in c onnection with the approvals of Bavencio(see 
Note 2C ). Our identifiable intangible assets are associated with the following, as a percentage of total identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization:
 
  December 31, 2017  
  IH   EH   WRD Developed technology rights
  68 % 31 % — Brands, finite-lived
  75 % 25 % — Brands, indefinite-lived
  71 % 29 % — IPR&D
  81 % 12 % 7 %Developed Technology Rights
Developed technology rights represent the amortized cost associated with developed technology, which has been acquired from third parties and which can include the right to
develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that
 we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processesthat have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing the commercialized
products included in our biopharmaceutical businesses. The more significant components of developed technology rights are the following (in order of significance): Xtandi,
Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Eucrisa, Enbrel, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, and
, to a lesser extent Tygacil, Pristiq, Refacto AF and Zavicefta. Also included in thiscategory are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain biopharmaceutical products.
Brands
Brands represent the amortized or unamortized cost associated with tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protec
tion. Most of theseassets are associated with our Consumer Healthcare business unit. The more significant components of indefinite-lived brands are the following (in order of significance): Advil,
Xanax/Xanax XR, Centrum, Caltrate, Medrol and Preparation H. The more significant components of finite-lived brands are the following (in order of significance): Nexium,
Depo-Provera, Zavedos and, to a lesser extent, Idoform Bifiform, Polocard and Advil Cold and Sinus.
IPR&D
IPR&D assets represent R&D assets that have not yet
 received regulatory approval in a major market. The more significant components of IPR&D at December 31, 2017 arethe programs for the treatment of non-metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer and
 the program for the oral PARP inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer, both acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition.
IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated
 R&D effort. Accordingly, during thedevelopment period after the date of acquisition, these assets will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S.
 or the EU, or in a seriesof other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At tha
t time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out ofIPR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned,
 the related IPR&D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty 
that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceuticalbusiness is high-risk and, as such, we expect that many of these IPR&D asse
ts will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future.Amortization
The weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets and the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 10 years. Total
amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was 
$4.8 billion in 2017 , $4.1 billion in 2016 and $3.8 billion in 2015 . The following table provides the annual amortization expense expected for the years 2018 through 2022:

 Primarily reflects the impact of foreign exchange and an adjustment of our estimate of goodwill associated with the HIS net assets sold.Note 11. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we
sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of
the IRC, and, generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of
 employees with restrictions ondiscriminating in favor of highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to
certain employees. In addition, we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.
Effective January 1, 2018, there were two significant defined benefit pension plans tha
t were frozen to future benefit accruals in the U.S. and U.K. and will result in theelimination of future service costs for those plans.

In April 2017, we settled the remaining obligation associated with the Hospira U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. We purchased a group annuity contract on behalf of the remaining plan participants with athird-party insurance provider. As 
a result, we were relieved of the $156 million net pension benefit obligation  and recorded a pretax settlement gain of $41 million , partially offset by the recognitio n of actuariallosses and prior serv
ice costs upon plan settlement of approximately $30 million in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs during the second quarter of  2017 (see Note 3 ). In 2015, the netperiodic benefit costs include
d settlement losses primarily related to participants accepting the lump-sum option made in an offer to certain pl an participants to elect a lump-sum payment to settle Pfizer’s pensionobligation with those particip
ants, or to elect an early annuity.114

Due to the U.S. Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan freeze effective for January 1, 2018, the average amortization period for the U.S. qualified plans and U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) plans will reflect theexpected life expectancy of th
e plan participants, whereas prior years utilized the expected future service period of plan participants. The average amortization periods to be utilized for 2018 are 24.8 years for ourU.S. qualified plans, 26.2 years f
or our U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) plans, 20.0 years for our international plans, and 9.7 for our postretirement plans.B. Actuarial Assumptions

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company changed the approach used to measure service cost and interest costs for certain international pension plans and other postretirement benefits. In accordance with thischange, the effective rate for i
nterest on the benefit obligations and effective rate for service cost, respectively, are reported for international pension plans.The assumptions above are used to develop the benefit obligations at fiscal year-end and to develop the
 net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, theassumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year are established at the end o
f each previous fiscal year, while the assumptions used to determine benefitobligations are established at each fiscal year-end.
The net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on at
 least an annual basis. We revise these assumptions basedon an annual evaluation of long-term trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost
 of providing retirement benefits.The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the
 prevailing market rate of aportfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect
 the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our internationalplans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/
Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curveapproach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 
2017 resulted in lower discount rates as compared to the prior year.

 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For adescription of our general accounting policies associated with developing fair value estimates, see 
Note 1E. For a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in the
fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments are valued based on
 year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments as appropriatefor lagged reporting of up to three months.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension and postretirement plans’ assets:
•
Cash and cash equivalents: Level 1 investments may include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments may includeshort-term investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.
•
Equity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published
NAV derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted,
suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using their last available price.
•

Actual percentage of plan assets in Other investments for 2017 includes $215 million , as compared to $235 million in 2016, related to a gro up fixed annuity insurance contract that was executed by legacy Wyethfor certain members of its defined 
benefit plans prior to Pfizer acquiring the company in 2009, and $253 million in 2017, as compared to $144 million in 2016, related to an inve stment in a partnership whose primaryholdings are public equity
 securities. Global plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to manage ne
t periodic benefitcosts and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets. Our long-term return
expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account
 historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification,active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change
, we may adjust ourtargets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.
Our long-term asset allocation ranges reflect our asset class return expectations and tolerance for investment risk within the context of 
the respective plans’ long-term benefitobligations. These ranges are supported by analysis that incorporates historical and expected returns by asset class, as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes
and our liability profile.
Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall investment of the pension plan assets. 
In determining investment policies andassociated target allocations, each committee or board considers a wide variety of factors. As such, the
 target asset allocation for each of our international pension plans is seton a standalone basis by the relevant board or committee. The target asset allocation ranges shown for the
 international pension plans seek to reflect the combined targetallocations across all such plans, while also showing the range within which the target allocations for each plan typically falls.
The investment managers of certain separately managed accounts, commingled funds and private equity funds may be permitted to use repurchase agreements and derivative
securities, including U.S. Treasury and equity futures contracts as described in each respective investment management, subscription, partnership or other governing
agreement.
E. Cash Flows
It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least
 sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws andlocal tax laws.

 For the U.S. qualified plans, a $500 million voluntary contribution was paid in February 2018.The above table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected 
to be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptionsused for the calculation of the benefit obligation and, therefore, actual bene
fit payments may differ from projected benefit payments.F. Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and several other countries. For the majority of the
 U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of theirsalaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of 
the employee contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2011, for newly hired non-union employees, rehiresand transfers to the U.S. or Puerto Rico, we no longer offer a
 defined benefit pension plan and, instead, offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) in the definedcontribution plan. The RSC is an annual non-contributory employer contribution (that is not dependent upon the participant making a contribution) determined based on each
employee’s eligible compensation, age and years of service. Beginning on January 1, 2018, all non-union employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit plans
transitioned to the RSC in the defined contribution plans. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of 
$380 million in 2017, 
$317 million in 2016 and $287 million in 2015 . Note 12. Equity
A. Common Stock
We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in open market purchases as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of
the share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our Board of Directors, are available for general corporate purposes. On June 27, 2013, we announced that 
the Board ofDirectors had authorized a 
$10 billion share-purchase plan, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2015. On October 23, 2014 , we announced that the Board of Directorshad authorized an additional 
$11 billion share repurchase program, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2017. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new 
$11 billion share repurchase program (the December 2015 Stock Purchase Plan) to be utilized over time, and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2017. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a new 
$10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. This new program is in addition to the 
$6.4 billion remaining under the December 2015 Stock Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2017. On February 9, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. to repurchase shares of
 our common stock. This agreement was entered intounder our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on February 11, 2015,
 we paid $5 billion to GS&Co. and received approximately 
151 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. On July 2, 2015, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. was completed, which, perthe terms of the agreement, resulted in us owing GS&Co. a certain number of shares o
f Pfizer common stock or its equivalent dollar value. Pursuant to the agreement’ssettlement terms, we elected to settle this amount in cash and paid an additional 
$160 million to GS&Co. on July 13, 2015, resulting in a total o f approximately $5.2 billion paid to GS&Co. The final average price paid for the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was 
$34.13 per share. On March 8, 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. to repurchase 
$5 billion of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on March 10, 2016, we paid 
$5 billion to GS&Co. and received an initial delivery of approximately 136 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. based on a price of 
$29.36 per share, which represented, based on the closing share price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 8,  2016, approximately 80% of the notional amount of the accelerated share repurchase agreement. On June 20, 2016, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with G
S&Co. was completed, which, per the terms of theagreement, resulted in GS&Co. owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock. Pursuant
 to the agreement’s settlement terms, we received an additional 18 million 
shares of our common stock from GS&Co. on June 20, 2016. The  average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreementwas 
$32.38 per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization.

On February 2, 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank to repurchase 
$5 billion of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on February 6, 2017, we paid 
$5 billion to Citibank and received an initial delivery of approximately 126 million shares of our common stock from Citibank at a price of 
$31.73 per share, which represented, based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on February 2,  2017, approximately 80% of the notional amount of the accelerated share repurchase agreement. On May 16, 2017, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank was completed, which, per the terms of the agreement,
resulted in Citibank owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock. Pursuant to the agreement’s settlement 
terms, we received an additional 24 million shares of our common stock from Citibank on May 19, 2017. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was 
$33.31 per share. The common stock received is included in 
Treasury Stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. The following table provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including

Includes approximately 151 million shares purchased for $5.2 billion pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase  agreement entered into on February 9, 2015 (see above for additionalinformation), as well as other share repurchases 
through year-end 2015.At 
December 31, 2017 , our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $16.4 billion . B. Preferred Stock
The Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock is held by an employee stock ownership plan (Preferred ESOP) Trust and provides dividends at the rate of 
6.25% , which are accumulated and paid quarterly. The per-share stated value is 
$40,300 and the preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock as to dividends and liquidation rights. Each share is convertible, at the holder’s option, into 
2,574.87 shares of our common stock with equal voting rights. The conversion option is indexed to our common stock and requires share settlement, and, therefore, is reported at the fair value at the da
te of issuance. We may redeem the preferred stock at any time or upon termination of thePreferred ESOP, at our option, in cash, in shares of
 common stock, or a combination of both at a price of $40,300 per share. C. Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We have 
two employee stock ownership plans (collectively, the ESOPs), the Preferred ESOP and another that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP).Allocated shares held by the Common ESOP, including reinvested dividends, are considered outstanding for EPS calculations and the
 eventual conversion of allocatedpreferred shares held by the Preferred ESOP are assumed in the diluted EPS calculation. 
As of December 31, 2017 , the Preferred ESOP held preferred shares convertible into approximately 
1 million shares of our common stock, and the Common ESOP held approximately 51 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017 , all shares of preferred and common stock held by the ESOPs have been allocated 
to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the CommonESOP was 
$11 million in 2017 , $9 million in 2016 and $8 million in 2015 . Prior to 2015, Pfizer matching contributions were primarily invested in the Common ESOP. Beginning in January 2015, Pfizer matching contributions are being invested based on the investment direction of the employees’ own contributions. As a
 result, the compensation costrelated to the Common ESOP was significantly lower after 2014.
Note 13. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. The award value is determined by reference to the fair value of share-based awards to similar employees in
competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes; and is allocated between different long-term incentive vehicles, in the form of RSUs, P
PSs,TSRUs, stock options, PSAs, PTSRUs and PTUs,
 as determined by the Compensation Committee.The 2014 Stock Plan (2014 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2004 Plan, as amended and resta
ted. The 2014 Plan provides for 520 million shares to be authorized for grants, plus any shares remaining available for grant under the 2004 Plan as of April 24, 2014 (the carryforward shares). In addition, the 2014 Plan provides that
 the number of stockoptions, Stock Appreciation Rights (known as TSRUs and PTSRUs), RSUs, or other performance-based awards that may be granted to any
 one individual during any 36-monthperiod is limited to 
20 million shares, and that RSUs, PPSs and PS As count as three shares, while TSRUs, PTSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward themaximum shares available under the 2014 plan. The 2004 Plan provided that the number of stock options, TSRUs or other performance-based awards granted to any one
individual during any 36-month period was limited to 
8 million shares, and that RSUs, PPSs and PS As counted against the maximum available shares as two shares, whilestock options and TSRUs counted as 
one share. As of December 31, 2017 , 290 million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to
 a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.122

C. Stock Options
Stock options are awarded to select employees and, when vested, entitle the holder to
 purchase a specified number of shares of our common stock at a price per share equalto the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
Beginning in 2016, only a limited set of overseas employees received stock option grants. 
No stock options were awarded to senior and other key management in any periodpresented; however, stock options were awarded to certain other employees. In virtually all instances, stock options granted since 2005 vest
 after three years of continuousservice from the grant date and have a contractual term of 10 years. In
 most cases, stock options must be held for at least one year from the grant date before any vesting mayoccur. In the event of a sale of business or plant closing or restructuring, options held by
 employees are immediately vested and are exercisable for a period from three monthsto their remaining term, depending on various conditions.
We measure the value of stock option grants as of the grant
 date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The values determined through this fair valuemethodology generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses

 awards vestafter three years of continuous service from the grant date and the number of
 shares paid, if any, depends on the achievement of predetermined goals related to Pfizer’s long-term product portfolio during a 5-year performance period from the year of the grant date. The number of shares that may be

We measure the value of PPS grants as of the
 grant date using the intrinsic value method, for which we use the closing price of our common stock. The values are amortizedon a straight-line basis over the probable vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate, and adjusted each reporting period, as necessary, to reflect changes in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, changes
 in the number of shares that are probable ofbeing earned and changes in management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and/or changes in management’s
assessment of the probable vesting term.

er Return UnitsTSRUs are awarded to senior and other key management, and, beginning in 2016, to certain other employees. TSRUs entitle the holders to
 receive a number of shares of ourcommon stock with a value equal to the difference between the defined settlement price and 
the grant price, plus the dividends accumulated during the five-year or seven-yearterm, if and to the extent the to
tal value is positive. The settlement price is the average closing price of our common stock during the 20 trading days ending on the fifth orseventh anniversary of the grant, as applicable; the grant price is the closing price of our common stock on the
 date of the grant. The TSRUs are automatically settled on thefifth or seventh anniversary of the grant but vest on 
the third anniversary of the grant, after which time there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture.On October 26, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved the modification of current outstanding grants
 of TSRU awards, effective November 1, 2016, to permit a holderwho is "retiree eligible" (at least age 55 with at least 10 years of service), to elect to exercise and convert his/her T
SRUs when vested, into PTUs. The value received upon theelection and conversion is calculated by taking the change in stock price ( 
20 trading day average ending on the exercise date (Election Price) less the grant price) plusaccumulated dividends from the grant date, times the number of TSRUs exercised. This value is divided by the Election Price to de
termine the number of PTUs. The PTUs willbe entitled to earn Dividend Equivalent Units (DEUs), and the PTUs and DEUs will be settled in our common stock on the TSRUs original settlement date (i.e.,
 the fifth orseventh anniversary of grant), and will be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the original grant including forfeiture provisions. This modification applied to approximately
2,900 
employees, including members of senior management. There was no incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification. In 2017, TSRUs were granted withthe right for retirement-eligible employees to elect to exercise and convert their TSRUs, when vested, into PTUs.
We measure the value of TSRU grants as of the grant date using a
 Monte Carlo simulation model. The values determined through this fair value methodology generally areamortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.

PSAs are awarded to senior and other key management. PSAs vest
 after three years of continuous service from the grant date. The number of shares paid, if any, includingshares resulting from dividend equivalents, for awards granted in 2015 and later, depends upon the achievement of predetermined goals related to 
two measures: (i) operatingincome over 
three one-year periods; and (ii) TSR as compared to the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index (DRG Index) over the three-year performance period. The number of shares paid from awards granted in 2014 depends upon the achievement of predetermined goals related to Pfizer's TSR as compared to an industry peer group, 
for the three-year performance period from the year of the grant date. The number of shares that are earned over 
the performance period ranges from 0% to 200% of the initial award. We measure the value of PSA grants as of the
 grant date using the intrinsic value method, for which we use the closing price of our common stock. The values are amortizedon a straight-line basis over the probable vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate, and adjusted each reporting period, as necessary, to reflect changes in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, changes
 in the number of shares that are probable ofbeing earned and changes in management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved.

Note 15. Lease Commitments
We lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay
 directly for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operatingexpenses or to pay higher rent when operating expenses increase. Rental expense, net of sublease income, was 
$314 million in 2017 , $292 million in 2016 and $243 million in 2015 
. The future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases follow:

  $209  $172  $150  $136  $123  $891 Note 16. Insurance
Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-
insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost
and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. 
If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceed insurance coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 flows or results of operations in theperiod in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued (see 
Note 17 ). Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see 
Note 5D. Pending approval in the EU of Mylotarg––Mylotarg was developed, in part, through a research arrangement with a third party. If Mylotarg is approved in the EU in 2018
 for thetreatment of acute myeloid leukemia, we will incur an obligation for additional fixed payments over a 10-year period aggregating 
$310 million . A. Legal Proceedings
Our non-tax contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. We are the plaintiff in the vastmajority of these actions. An adverse outcome in actions in which we are the plaintiff could result in loss of paten
t protection for a drug, a significant loss of revenues fromthat drug or impairment of the value of associated assets.
•
Product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims,among others, often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual,
provable injury and other matters.
•
Commercial and other matters, which can include merger-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, can involve complexities that willvary from matter to matter.
•
Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. andin other countries. 
Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial.
We believe that our claims and defenses in these matters are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do no
t believe that anyof these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the
outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of
 operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or ourcash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that
 have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment processrelies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause
 us tochange those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and
qualitative factors in order to assess materiality, such as, among other things, the amount of
 damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding, if suchdamages and other relief are specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength o
f our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if notcertified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; any experience that we or, to
 our knowledge,other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure
might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader;

potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent o
f public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, weconsider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the pa
tent. As a result of considering qualitative factors in our determination of principalmatters, there are some matters discussed below with respect to which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.
A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are involved in numerous suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most of the suits
 involveclaims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of 
the generic drugmanufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts 
to enforce, patent rights with respect tocertain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the
 challenges to the U.S. patents on a number of our products that are discussedbelow, patent rights to certain of our products are being challenged in various other countries. We are also party to other pa
tent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuantto which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. Additionally, our licensing and
collaboration partners face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion rights. We also are often
involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the
European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of
 others. Also, if one of our patents is found to beinvalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several
of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the United States. The invalidation of
these patents could potentially allow a competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace. We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant 
to which one or more thirdparties seeks damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. For example, our subsidiary, Hospira,
is involved in patent and patent-related disputes over its attempts to bring generic pharmaceutical and biosimilar products to market. If one of our marketed products
 is found toinfringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages, or we may be prevented from further sales of
 that product. Such damages maybe enhanced as much as three-fold in the event that we or one of
 our subsidiaries, like Hospira, is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.Actions In Which We Are 
The PlaintiffBosulif (bosutinib)
In December 2016, Wyeth LLC, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc., and PF 
Prism C.V. (collectively, Wyeth) brought a patent-infringement action against Alembic Pharmaceuticals,Ltd, Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Alembic), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (collectively, Sun), in the U.
S. DistrictCourt for the District of Delaware in connection with abbreviated new drug applications respectively filed with the FDA by Alembic and Sun, each seeking approval to market
generic versions of bosutinib. Alembic is challenging patents, which expire in 2026, covering polymorphic forms of bosutinib and methods of treating chronic myelogenous
leukemia. Sun is challenging the patent covering polymorphic forms of bosutinib that expires in 2026. In March 2017, Wyeth brought a pa
tent-infringement action against MSNLaboratories Private Limited and MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, MSN), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in connection with an abbreviated new
drug application filed with the FDA by MSN, seeking approval to market a generic version of bosutinib, and challenging a patent expiring in 2026 covering polymorphic forms of
bosutinib. In September 2017, the case against MSN was dismissed. Also, in September 2017,
 Wyeth brought an additional patent-infringement action against Sun in the U.S.District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the infringement and validity of 
two other patents challenged by Sun, which expire in 2025 and 2026 respectively, coveringcompositions of bosutinib and methods of treating chronic myelogenous leukemia.
EpiPen
In July 2010, King, which we acquired in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary, brought a patent-infringement action against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for 
the District ofNew Jersey in connection with Sandoz’s abbreviated new drug application filed with the FDA seeking approval to market an epinephrine injectable product. Sandoz is
challenging patents, which expire in 2025, covering the next-generation autoinjector for use with epinephrine that is sold under the EpiPen brand name.
Precedex Premix
In June 2014, 
Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc. (Ben Venue) notified our subsidiary, Hospira, that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Hospira’s premix version of Precedex and containing allegations that a patent relating to the use of Precedex in an intensive care unit
 setting, whichexpires in March 2019, was invalid or not infringed. In August 2014, Hospira and Orion Corporation (co-owner of the patent that is the subject
 of the lawsuit) filed suit againstBen Venue, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (Hikma), and West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the validity and
infringement of the patent. In October 2014, 
Eurohealth International Sarl was substituted for Ben Venue and Hikma. In June 2016, this case was settled on terms not materialto Pfizer.
In June 2015, Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC (Amneal) notified Hospira that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic
version of Hospira’s premix version of Precedex and containing allegations that 
four patents relating to the Precedex premix formulations and their use, all of which expire in2032, were invalid or not infringed. In August 2015, Hospira filed suit against Amneal in the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Delaware asserting the validity and infringementof the patents that are the subject o
f the lawsuit. In January 2018, the District Court ruled that one of the four patents was valid and infringed, and that the other three patents were invalid.
In December 2015, Fresenius Kabi USA LLC (Fresenius) notified Hospira that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a
generic version of Hospira’s premix version of Precedex and containing allegations that 
four patents relating to the Precedex premix formulations and their use, all of whichexpire in 2032, were invalid or not infringed. In January 2016, Hospira filed suit against Fresenius in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting the
validity and infringement of the patents that are the subject of
 the lawsuit.130

four patents relating to the Precedex premix formulations and their use, all of which expire in 2032, wereinvalid or not infringed. In September 2016, Hospira filed suit against Par in the U.S. District Court for the District of
 Delaware asserting the validity and infringement of thepatents that are the subject of the lawsuit. 
In December 2016, the case was stayed pending the outcome of Hospira’s suit against Amneal (including all appeals).Toviaz (fesoterodine)
We have an exclusive, worldwide license to market Toviaz from UCB Pharma GmbH (UCB), which owns the patents relating to Toviaz.
Beginning in May 2013, several generic drug manufacturers notified us that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market generic
versions of Toviaz and asserting the invalidity, unenforceability and/or non-infringement of all of our patents for Toviaz that are listed in the FDA’s list o
f Approved DrugProducts with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the “Orange Book”. Beginning in June 2013, we filed actions against all of
 those generic drugmanufacturers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the infringement of 
five of the patents for Toviaz: three composition-of-matter patents and a method-of-use patent that expire in 2019 and a patent covering salts of 
fesoterodine that expires in 2022. In June and July 2015, we settled with four of the generic defendants.The trial relating to the 
four remaining defendants occurred in July 2015. In April 2016, the District Court held that the patents that were the subject of the lawsuit were valid andinfringed. The defendants’ deadline to appeal this decision expired in June 2016.
In December 2014, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Mylan Pharmaceuticals) notified us that it had filed an 
abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Toviaz and asserting the invalidity, unenforceability and/or non-infringement of all of our patents for Toviaz that are listed in the 
Orange Book. InJanuary 2015, we filed an action against Mylan Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the infringement of 
five of the patents for Toviaz:three 
composition-of-matter patents and a method-of-use patent that expire in 2019 and a patent  covering salts of fesoterodine that expires in 2022. In January 2017, theDistrict Court issued a verdict finding that the 
five patents that are the subject of the lawsuit are valid and infringed. In August 2017, the District Court issued a written decisionconsistent with the verdict, finding the 
five patents valid and infringed. In September 2017, Mylan Pharmaceuticals appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit. 
In January 2018, Mylan Pharmaceuticals withdrew its appeal. Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
In February 2017, we brought a patent-infringement action against MicroLabs USA Inc. and MicroLabs Ltd. (collectively, MicroLabs) in the U.S. District Court for the
 District ofDelaware asserting the infringement and validity of 
three patents challenged by MicroLabs in its abbreviated new drug application seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg tablets. Of the

twenty-five generic companies sent BMS Paragraph-IV certification letters informing BMS that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications seeking approval of generic versions of Eliquis, challenging the validity and infringement of one or more of the 
three patents listed in the Orange Book for Eliquis. The patents currently are set to expire in 2019, 2026, and 2031. 
Eliquis has been jointly developed and is being commercialized by BMS and Pfizer. In April 2017, BMS andPfizer filed patent-infringement actions against all generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S. District Court for the District of
 West Virginia,asserting that each of the generic companies’ proposed products would infringe each of the patent(s) that each
 generic filer challenged. Some generic filers challenged only the2031 patent, some challenged both the 2031 and 2026 patent
, and one generic company challenged all three patents. We and BMS have settled with certain of the genericcompanies on terms not material to Pfizer and we and BMS may settle with other generic companies in the future.
Bavencio (avelumab)
In July 2017, BMS, E.R. Squibb & 
Sons LLC, Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and Tasuku Honjo brought a patent-infringement action in the U.S. District Court for the District ofDelaware against Pfizer, Merck KGaA, and EMD Serono, alleging that Bavencio (avelumab) infringes 
one patent relating to methods for treating tumors with anti-PD-L1antibodies, which expires in 2023.
Actions In Which We Are 
The DefendantInflectra (infliximab-dyyb)
In March 2015, Janssen and New York University, together, brought a patent-infringement action in the U.S
. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Hospira,Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. alleging that infliximab-dyyb, to be marketed by Hospira in the U.S. under the brand name Inflectra, would infringe 
six patentsrelating to infliximab, its manufacture and use. Claims with respect to 
four of the patents have since been dismissed by the plaintiffs, leaving two patents at issue in the ongoingaction: the infliximab antibody patent and a patent relating to cell culture media. In Augus
t 2016, the District Court ruled that the antibody patent was invalid, and Janssenappealed that ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, 
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the infliximab antibody patent wasinvalid in Janssen’s appeal of a separate decision from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tha
t also declared the antibody patent invalid. Subsequently, the Court of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit dismissed Janssen’s appeal of the District Court decision.
A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other
products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation, which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In
connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other
claims. As of 
December 31, 2017 , approximately 56,500 claims naming American Optical and numerous other defendants were pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits are pending against Pfizer in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing
asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned
by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.
Effexor
Beginning in May 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions,
 affiliates of Wyeth and certainother defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Ef
fexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting ofall persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR 
from any ofthe defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the de
fendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of genericEffexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and,
 in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certainstates, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Ef
fexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR andentering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each o
f the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in theindividual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor 
XR in the U.S. and itsterritories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S
. District Court for the District of New Jersey.In October 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement but declined to dismiss the other direct
purchaser plaintiff claims. In January 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers
and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Third Circuit. In August 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed theDistrict Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.

Zoloft
A number of individual lawsuits and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us and/or our subsidiaries in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury as a
result of the purported ingestion of Zoloft. Among other types o
f actions, the Zoloft personal injury litigation includes actions alleging a variety of birth defects as a result of thepurported ingestion of Zoloft by women during pregnancy. Plaintiffs in these birth-defect actions seek compensatory and punitive damages and 
the disgorgement of profitsresulting from the sale of Zoloft. In April 2012, the federal birth-defect cases were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Zoloft Products Liability Litigation MDL-2342 
) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. A number of  plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their actions. In April2016, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing the claims of almost all of the remaining plaintiffs. In May 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the
 DistrictCourt’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In June 2017,
 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision.Lipitor
•
Antitrust ActionsBeginning in November 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain affiliates of Pfizer, and, in most
of the actions, Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) and certain affiliates of Ranbaxy. The
 plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classesconsisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from
any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of 
the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of genericLipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which P
fizer andRanbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor, and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates,
and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. 
Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf ofthe putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed
against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert
 claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted andthe relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Lipitor Antitrust Litigation MDL-2332 
) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims by direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with
prejudice the claims of all other Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and 
for leave to amend theircomplaint to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In Augus
t 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s decisions and remandedsubstantially all of the claims to the District Court.
Also, in January 2013, the State of West
 Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief onbehalf of the State of West 
Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions describedabove.
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed type 2 diabetes
 as a resultof the purported ingestion of Lipitor. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In February 2014, the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium) Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation (No. II) MDL-2502 
) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. Since 2016, certain cases in the Multi-District Litigationwere remanded to certain state courts. In January 2017, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing substantially all of the remaining cases
pending in the Multi-District Litigation. In January 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of
 Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Viagra
A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed melanoma and/or the
exacerbation of melanoma as a result of the purported ingestion of Viagra. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In April 2016, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In Re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2691 
) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In December 2016, federal actions filed against Lilly and filed against both us and Lilly, were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to the Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) and Cialis (Tadalafil) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2691 ). Celebrex
Beginning in July 2014, purported class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Pfizer and certain subsidiaries of P
fizer relating toCelebrex. The plaintiffs seek to represent U.S. nationwide or multi-state classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased from the defendants,
 or indirectlypurchased or reimbursed patients for some or all of the purchase price of, Celebrex or generic Celebrex from May 31, 2014 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly
unlawful conduct. The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Celebrex in violation of federal antitrust laws or certain state antitrust, consumer protection and various
other laws as a result of Pfizer fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing a patent on Celebrex, engaging in sham litigation and prolonging the impact of sham litigation
through settlement activity that further delayed generic entry. Each of 
the actions seeks treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges forCelebrex since May 31, 2014. In December 2014, the District Court granted the parties’ joint motions to consolidate the direct purchaser and end-payer cases, and all such
cases were consolidated as of March 2015. In October 2014 and March 2015, we filed motions to dismiss the direct purchasers’ and end-payers’ amended complaints,
respectively. In November 2015, the District Court denied in part and granted in part our motion to dismiss the direct purchasers’ amended complaint. In February 2016, the

 approval, to resolve the direct purchasers’ classaction for 
$94 million . In November 2017, Pfizer and the end-payers entered into an agreement to resolve the claims of the end-payer plaintiffs on terms not material to Pfizer.Intravenous Solutions
Beginning in November 2016, purported class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Hospira, Hospira Worldwide, Inc. and certain
other defendants relating to intravenous saline solution. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all persons and en
tities in the U.S. who directly purchased intravenoussaline solution sold by any of the defendants from January 1, 2013 until the 
time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceases. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants’conduct restricts output and artificially fixes, raises, maintains and/or stabilizes the prices of intravenous saline solution sold throughout the U.S. in violation of
 federal antitrustlaws. Plaintiffs seek treble damages (for themselves and on behalf of the putative classes) and an injunction against de
fendants for alleged price overcharges for intravenoussaline solution in the U.S. since January 1, 2013. All of these actions have
 been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On February 3, 2017,we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS, which includes intravenous saline solution, to ICU Medical. The litigation is the subject
 of cross-claims forindemnification by both Pfizer and ICU Medical under the purchase agreement.
Separately, in April 2017, Pfizer, Hospira and 
two employees of Pfizer received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District ofPennsylvania, in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, 
Antitrust Division. The subpoenas seek documents related to the sale, manufacture, pricingand shortages of intravenous solutions, including saline, as well as communications among industry participants regarding these issues. The Department of Justice
investigation is also the subject of cross-claims for indemnification by both Pfizer and ICU Medical under the purchase agreement. In addition, in August 2015,
 the New YorkAttorney General issued a subpoena to Hospira for similar information. Hospira has produced records to the New York Attorney General and is coordinating with ICU Medical to
produce records to the New York Attorney General as appropriate going forward, and Hospira and Pfizer are coordinating with ICU Medical to produce records to the
Department of Justice.

and/or various entities affiliated with Mylan N.V., and Mylan N.V. Chief Executive Officer, Heather 
Bresch. The plaintiffs in these actions seek to represent U.S. nationwideclasses comprising persons or entities who paid for any portion of the end-user purchase price of an EpiPen between 2009 until the cessation of
 the defendants’ allegedlyunlawful conduct. In August 2017, a similar lawsuit brought on behalf of a purported class of direct purchaser plaintiffs against
 Pfizer, King, Meridian and Mylan was voluntarilydismissed without prejudice. Against Pfizer and/or its affiliates, plaintiffs generally allege that Pfizer’s and/or its affiliates’ settlement of paten
t litigation regarding EpiPen delayedmarket entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust or consumer protection laws. At

A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and O
ther MattersAverage Wholesale Price Litigation
Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and other pharmaceutical manufacturers were sued in various state courts by a number of states alleging that the
 defendants provided averagewholesale price (AWP) information for certain of their products that was higher than the actual average prices at which those products were sold. The AW
P is used to determinereimbursement levels under Medicare Part B and Medicaid and in many private-sector insurance policies and medical plans. All but 
one of those actions have been resolvedthrough settlement, dismissal or final judgment. The plaintiff state, Illinois, 
in the one remaining action claims that the alleged spread between the AWPs at which purchaserswere reimbursed and the actual sale prices was promoted by the defendants as an incentive to purchase certain of their products. The
 action alleges, among other things, fraud and violation of the state’s unfair trade practices and 
consumer protection statutes and seeks monetary and other relief, including civil penalties and treble damages. Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and
spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000,
 Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operationsto a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by
Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to
 indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s formeragricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural
business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of its
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are primarily limited to
sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spinof
f that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmaciafor, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New
Monsanto’s assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to
 Former Monsanto’s chemicalbusinesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated
biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical
businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, we submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) a corrective measures study report with regard to Pharmacia’s discontinued industrial chemicalfacility in North Haven, Connecticut and a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to Wyeth Holdings Corporation’s discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook,
New Jersey. In September 2010, our corrective measures study report with regard to the North Haven facility was approved by the EP
A, and we commenced construction of thesite remedy in late 2011 under an Updated Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA. In
 July 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation finalized an Administrative SettlementAgreement and Order on Consent for Removal Action (the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) with the EP
A with regard to the Bound Brook facility. In May 2012, wecompleted construction of an interim remedy to address the discharge of impacted groundwater from that facility to the Raritan River. In Sep
tember 2012, the EPA issued a finalremediation plan for the Bound Brook facility’s main plant area, which is generally in accordance with one of the remedies evaluated in our revised site-wide feasibility study. In
March 2013, Wyeth Holdings Corporation (now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to
 allow us toundertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the main plant area and to perform a focused feasibility study for 
two adjacent lagoons. In September 2015, the U.S.,on behalf of the EPA, lodged a complaint and consent
 decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey that allows Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete thedesign and to implement the remedy for the main plant area. In December 2015, the consent decree (which supersedes the 2011 
Administrative Settlement Agreement) wasentered by the District Court. We have accrued for the estimated costs of
 the site remedy for the North Haven facility and the site remediation for the Bound Brook facility.We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
 amended, and otherstate, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In October 2017, a number of United States service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia against a
number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the United States Anti-Terrorism
Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to
 pharmaceutical and medical devicecontracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief.
A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple
emerging markets in which we operate. As a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. Criminal charges, and substantial fines and/or civil
penalties, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from government investigations. Among the investigations by
government agencies are the matters discussed below.

A5. Legal Proceedings––Matters Resolved 
During 2017During 2017, certain matters, including the matter discussed below, were resolved or were the subject of definitive settlement agreements or settlement agreements-in-
principle.
Xtandi
In April 2014, the Regents of the University of California (the Regents) filed a complaint against the Medivation Group in California Superior Court in San Francisco. Medivation
was acquired by Pfizer in September 2016 and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. The Regents’ complaint sought a 
10% share, under a license agreement between the Medivation Group and the Regents, of certain payments the Medivation Group receives with respect to
 Xtandi under the Medivation Group’s sub-licensing and collaborationagreement with Astellas. Trial was scheduled to commence in May 2017. In July 2017, the parties resolved the matter through a se
ttlement on terms not material to Pfizer,which was recorded in the second quarter of 2017 as a measurement period adjustment related to the Medivation acquisition.
B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and
 other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certainliabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If
 the indemnified party were to make asuccessful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and
limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2017 the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations was not significant.
Pfizer Inc. has also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that it acquired and 
that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.C. Commitments

Other Costs and Business Activities
Certain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the
 following:•
WRD, which is generally responsible for research projects for our IH business until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the IH segmentvia the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The
WRD organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the
various R&D projects, including EH R&D projects. WRD is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all
safety-event activities.
•
GPD, which is generally responsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios. GPD also provides technicalsupport and other services to Pfizer R&D projects.
•
Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs,compliance and worldwide procurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments.
Effective in the first quarter of 
2017 , Corporate also includes the costs associated with our Pfizer Medical organization (Medical), previously reported as part of Other Business Activities. Medical is responsible for the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities,
clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, and partnerships with global public health and medical associations. In
2015, Medical was also responsible for regulatory inspection readiness reviews, internal audits of Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials and internal regulatory compliance
processes, which are now part of the compliance function within Corporate.
•
Other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operatingsegment as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs (which include manufacturing variances associated with production).
•
Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments toinventory, intangible assets and PP&E; (ii) acquisition-related costs, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the
 acquired operations and restructuringthe combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as restructuring or legal
charges) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size,
 would not be expected to occur as part of our normalbusiness on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset
impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.

Segment Assets
We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as
 many of our operating assets are shared (such as our plant network assets) or commingled(such as accounts receivable, as many of our customers are served by both operating segments). Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any
asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets
 were approximately $172 billion as of December 31, 2017 
and approximately $172 billion as of December 31, 2016 . Selected Income Statement Information
