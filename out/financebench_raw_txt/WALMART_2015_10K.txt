WAL-MART STORES, INC.  
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2015  
PART I  
General  
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere

Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differe ntiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. Leading on price 
is designed to earn the trust of our customers ever y day by providing a broad assortment of quality me rchandise and services at everyday low 
prices ("EDLP"), while fostering a culture that rew ards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and div ersity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy 
under which we price items at a low price every day  so our customers trust that our prices will not ch ange under frequent promotional activity. 
Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday lo w cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expens es so those cost savings can be 
passed along to our customers. Our digital and phys ical presence provides customers access to our broa d assortment anytime and anywhere. 
We strive to give our customers and members a great  digital and physical shopping experience.  
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31 
for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operati ons. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar 
basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal y ears ended January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 "), Janua ry 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014 ") and January 31, 
2013 ("fiscal 2013 "). During fiscal 2015 , we gene rated total revenues of $ 485.7 billion , which was  primarily comprised of net sales of 
$482.2 billion .  
We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th S treet, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common  stock trades on the New York 
Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."  
The Development of Our Company  
Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in Oc tober 1969, the businesses conducted by our founder s began in 1945 when Sam M. 
Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety stor e in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James  L. Walton, opened a similar store in 
Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' bus iness was devoted entirely to the operation of vari ety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart 
Discount City, which was a discount store, opened i n Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first th ree Sam's Clubs, and in 1988, we 
opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened ou r first Neighborhood Market.  
In 1991, we began our first international initiativ e when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. S ince then, our international presence has 
continued to expand and as of January 31, 2015 , ou r Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries.  
In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by c reating the walmart.com retail website. Since then,  our digital presence has continued to grow 
and as of January 31, 2015 , we operated e-commerce  websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walm art and our various brands around the 
world.  
 
7  ITEM 1.  BUSINESS  
 
Information About Our Segments  
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U. S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, 
Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico  and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations a re conducted in three reportable 
segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and S am's Club. The Company defines its segments as thos e operations whose results the chief 
operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews  to analyze performance and allocate resources. The  Company sells similar individual 
products and services in each of its segments. It i s impractical to segregate and identify revenues fo r each of these individual products and 
services.  
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates re tail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washingto n D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary 
store formats, as well as digital retail. Walmart U .S. generated approximately 60% of our net sales in  fiscal 2015 , and of our three segments, 
Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically ha d the highest gross profit as a percentage of net s ales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, 
Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the great est amount to the Company's net sales and operating  income.  
Walmart International consists of operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous  formats divided into three major 
categories: retail, wholesale and other. These cate gories consist of numerous formats, including super centers, supermarkets, hypermarkets, 
warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash & carr y, home improvement, specialty electronics, restaur ants, apparel stores, drug stores and 
convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walm art International generated approximately 28% of ou r fiscal 2015 net sales. The overall gross 
profit rate for Walmart International is lower than  that of Walmart U.S. because of its merchandise mi x. Walmart International is our second 
largest segment and has grown through acquisitions,  as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other u nits.  
Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse cl ubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Pu erto Rico, as well as digital retail. 
Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our f iscal 2015 net sales. As a membership-only warehous e club, membership income is a 
significant component of the segment's operating in come. As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower  gross profit rate and lower operating 
expenses as a percentage of net sales than our othe r segments.  
The Company measures the results of its segments us ing, among other measures, each segment's net sales  and operating income, which 
includes certain corporate overhead allocations. Fr om time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including 
any corporate overhead allocations, as determined b y the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. W hen the measurement of a segment 
changes, previous period amounts and balances are r eclassified to be comparable to the current period' s presentation.  
Walmart U.S. Segment  
The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart" or  "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as 
walmart.com. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales  of $288.0 billion , $279.4 billion and $274.4 bill ion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , 
respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, n o single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales.  
Physical. The Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D. C. and Puerto Rico, with 
supercenters in 49 states, Washington D.C. and Puer to Rico, discount stores in 42 states and Puerto Ri co and Neighborhood Markets and other

Unit counts (1) as of January 31, 2015 for Walmart International ar e summarized by major category for each geographic market as follows:  
Digital. The Walmart International segment operates e-commer ce websites in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Can ada, Chile, China, India, 
Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom) . Customers have access through our e-commerce webs ites and mobile commerce 
applications to a broad assortment of merchandise a nd services, both of which vary by country. Digital  retail supports our physical stores with 
capabilities like "Click & Collect" in the United K ingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Me xico.  
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart Internat ional segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the 
breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majorit y of our sales, we have both leveraged 
U.S. private brands and developed market specific p rivate brands to serve our customers with high qual ity, lower priced items. Along with the 
private brands we market globally, such as "Equate, " "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hometre nds," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and 
"Parent’s Choice," our international markets have d eveloped market specific brands including "Aurrera, " "Cambridge," "Chosen by You," 
"Extra Special" and "Smart Price." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and loca l suppliers in each market to ensure 
reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equ al to national brands at low prices.  
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the W almart International segment vary by country and by  individual markets within 
countries, depending upon local and national ordina nces governing hours of operation. Each country acc epts a variety of payment methods.  
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is sea sonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segmen t's 
highest sales volume and operating income have occu rred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by 
country due to different national and religious hol idays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.  
Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a v ariety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, 
grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty st ores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improveme nt, specialty electronic, e-commerce 
and catalog businesses in each of the markets in wh ich we operate. We also operate some restaurants an d, on a limited basis, consumer finance 
operations. We compete with others for desirable si tes. Our ability to develop, open and operate units  at the right locations and to deliver a 
customer-centric experience that seamlessly integra tes digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in 
the markets in which Walmart International operates . We believe EDLP is the right business model for o ur customers and for all of our markets 
and we are in the midst of a multi-year plan to tra nsition all of our markets to EDLP. Additionally, o ur ability to operate food departments 
effectively has a significant impact on our competi tive position in the markets where we operate.

and 2013 :   
Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monda y through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Satu rday from 9:00 a.m. to 
8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. A dditionally, all club locations offer Business Memb ers and Plus Members the ability to 
shop before the regular operating hours Monday thro ugh Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. A variety of pa yment methods are accepted at our clubs 
and online, including the Sam's Club cash-back Mast erCard.  
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and 
religious holidays, as well as different weather pa tterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in 
the fiscal quarter ending January 31.  
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only ware house clubs, the largest of which are Costco Wholes ale and BJ's 
Wholesale Club, as well as with discount retailers,  retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline 
stations, e-commerce and catalog businesses. Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehou se clubs for desirable new club sites. 
At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only pri ces, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk siz ing to serve both our Savings and 
Business members. Our strategy allows us to differe ntiate ourselves within the membership-only warehou se club industry and the overall retail 
industry.  
Distribution. During fiscal 2015 , approximately 66% of the Sam's  Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped fro m the Sam's Club 
segment's 24 dedicated distribution facilities located strategic ally throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walma rt U.S. segment's distribution 
facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment fo r certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of t he Sam's Club segment's purchases directly 
to Sam's Club locations. The table below provides f urther details of our dedicated distribution facili ties as of January 31, 2015 .  
The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution op erations is on cross-docking merchandise, while sto red inventory is minimized. Cross-
docking is a distribution process under which shipm ents are directly transferred from inbound to outbo und trailers. Shipments typically spend 
less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and so metimes less than an hour.  
Sam's Club uses a combination of a private truck fl eet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-p erishable merchandise from distribution 
facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with com mon carriers to transport perishable grocery mercha ndise from distribution facilities to clubs.

Other Segment Information  
Certain financial information relating to our segme nts is included in our Annual Report to Shareholder s for the fiscal year ended January 31, 
2015 ("Annual Report to Shareholders") under the ca ption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Fina ncial Condition and Results of 
Operations" and in Note 14 in the "Notes to Consoli dated Financial Statements" included therein, which  information is incorporated herein by

Portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are i ncluded as Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form  10-K and incorporated by reference 
herein as expressly provided herein.  
Employees  
As of the end of fiscal 2015 , the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.2 million emp loyees ("associates") worldwide, with 
nearly 1.4 million associates in the U.S. and 0.8 m illion associates internationally. Similar to other retail ers, the Company has a large number of 
part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates and a la rge number of associates turn over each year. We be lieve our relationships with our 
associates are good.  
On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a signi ficant initiative on pay and training for U.S. asso ciates. Approximately 500,000 full-
time and part- time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Cl ubs will receive pay raises in the first half of fi scal 2016. Also included in the 
announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiri ng, training, compensation and scheduling programs,  as well as to our store management 
structure. These changes will give our U.S. associa tes the opportunity to earn higher pay and advance in their careers.  
Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included i n our Annual Report to Shareholders in 
Note 12 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Sta tements" included therein, which information is inc orporated herein by reference.  
In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-p aid benefits to our associates, including 
store discount cards or Sam's Club memberships, bon uses based on Company performance, matching a porti on of purchases through the 
Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. T he Company also offers health-care benefits to elig ible full-time and part-time associates in 
the U.S. The Company's medical plan in the U.S. has  no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses.  
Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits th at vary based on customary local practices 
and statutory requirements.

The risks described below could materially and adve rsely affect our business, results of operations, f inancial condition and liquidity. Our 
business operations could also be affected by addit ional factors that apply to all companies operating  in the U.S. and globally.  
Global and Domestic Economic Risks and Consumer Dem and Risks  
General or macro-economic factors, both domesticall y and internationally, may materially adversely aff ect our financial performance.  
General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher 
interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs,  weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflati on, increased costs of essential services, such 
as medical care and utilities, higher levels of une mployment, decreases in consumer disposable income,  unavailability of consumer credit, 
higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer sp ending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in curre ncy exchange rates, higher tax rates, 
imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other chang es in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall e conomic slowdown and other economic 
factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our busin ess, change the mix of products we sell 
to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a s lowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and res ult in slower inventory turnover and 
greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of un employment, inflation, deflation, decreases in cons umer disposable income, unavailability 
of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending an d shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws,  higher fuel and other energy costs, 
weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations a nd other adverse developments in the 
economies of the other countries in which we operat e may adversely affect consumer demand for our merc handise in those countries, 
especially those countries in which average incomes  are significantly lower than average incomes in th e U.S. These conditions may adversely 
affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affec t our operations and consolidated 
operating results.  
Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy  costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher cos ts of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency 
exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and ot her changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws , the imposition of measures that create 
barriers to or increase the costs associated with i nternational trade, changes in other laws and regul ations and other economic factors in the U.S. 
and other countries in which we have operations can  increase our cost of sales and operating, selling,  general and administrative expenses, and 
otherwise adversely affect our domestic and interna tional operations and our operating results. The ec onomic factors that affect our operations 
also affect the operations and economic viability o f our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a fact or that can result in an increase in the 
cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or , in more extreme cases, could result in certain su ppliers not producing goods in the volume 
typically available to us for sale.  
We may not timely identify or effectively respond t o consumer trends or preferences, whether involving  physical retail, digital retail or 
a combination of both retail offerings, which could  negatively affect our relationship with our custom ers, the demand for our products 
and services, and our market share.  
It is difficult to predict consistently and success fully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends 
in part on how accurately we predict consumer deman d, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and 
the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, throug h our digital retail businesses or 
through the combination of both retail offerings. A  critical piece of identifying consumer preferences  involves price transparency, assortment of 
products, customer experience and convenience. Thes e factors are of primary importance to customers an d they continue to increase in 
importance, particularly as a result of digital too ls and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for 
purchasing products online, at physical locations o r through a combination of both retail offerings. F ailure to timely identify or effectively 
respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (i ncluding the key factors described above) and spend ing patterns, whether for our physical 
retail offerings, digital retail offerings or a com bination of these retail offerings, could negativel y affect our relationship with our customers, the 
demand for our products and services and our market  share.  
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversel y affect our financial performance and our reported  results of operations.  
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are  conducted primarily in the local currencies of tho se countries. Our consolidated financial 
statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translat e the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net 
sales, other revenues and expenses of our operation s outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U. S. dollars using exchange rates for the 
current period. As a result of such translations, f uture fluctuations in currency exchange rate over t ime that are unfavorable to us may result in 
our consolidated financial statements reflecting si gnificant adverse period-over-period changes in our  financial performance. Such unfavorable 
currency exchange rate  
 
20  ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  
 
fluctuations will adversely affect the reported per formance of our Walmart International operating seg ment and have a corresponding adverse 
affect on our reported consolidated results of oper ations.  
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our  stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the 
country in which the goods will be sold. When we mu st acquire the currency to pay for such products an d the exchange rates for the payment 
currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, o ur cost of goods sold may increase and we may be un able or unwilling to change the prices 
at which we sell those goods to address that increa se in our costs. Consequently, fluctuations in curr ency exchange rates may adversely affect 
our results of operations.  
Capital Investment and Information Systems Risks  
 
We may face impediments to our expansion in the U.S ., including conversions of discount stores into su percenters and opening other 
store formats, which may adversely affect our finan cial performance.  
Our expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our  ability to execute our retail concepts successfull y in new markets within the U.S. and 
upon our ability to increase the number of stores i n markets in which we currently have operations. Ou r ability to open additional supercenters, 
discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs and to convert existing di scount stores into supercenters depends 
in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire a nd retain qualified personnel and to acquire new st ore sites on acceptable terms. Local real 
estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations res tricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as 
well as local community action opposed to the locat ion of specific stores at specific sites and the ad option of certain local laws restricting our 
operations, may affect our ability to open new stor es and clubs, to convert discount stores into super centers or to relocate or expand existing 
units in certain cities and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could li mit our growth opportunities and our ability 
to convert our discount stores into supercenters. I f we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small 
formats or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert disco unt stores into supercenters, our financial perform ance, such as net sales and operating 
income growth, could be adversely affected. In addi tion, if consumers in the markets into which we exp and are not receptive to our retail 
concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our pres ence in a market, our financial performance could b e adversely affected.  
Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart Interna tional operations could adversely affect our financ ial performance.  
Our business strategy for our Walmart International  segment includes expansion by selective acquisitio ns and strategic alliances that add new 
stores and markets to our existing Walmart Internat ional business, as well as opening new units in the  countries in which we have existing 
operations. In the countries in which we have exist ing operations, new units may be opened in the form ats already existing in those countries or 
may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operate d in those markets. As in the U.S., our 
ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate  existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large 
measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain  qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new  store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws 
can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-ex isting buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand 
existing units. In addition, access to local suppli ers of certain types of goods may limit our ability  to add new units or to expand product 
selections in existing units in certain markets, es pecially in those markets in which consumers desire  to purchase locally produced goods. 
Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into  which we expand or into which we introduce new ret ail concepts may result in the 
consumers in those markets not being as receptive t o our retail concepts as we anticipate those consum ers will be and may make an effective 
response to such issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plan s for our Walmart International segment, 
our financial performance could be adversely affect ed.  
We may be unable to continue to identify suitable a cquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the 
acquisition of any such candidate identified. Altho ugh we ultimately believe we will be able to succes sfully integrate any newly acquired 
operations into our existing operations, no certain ty exists that future acquisitions or alliances wil l be successfully integrated into our operations 
or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable t ime. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates  for acquisition or alliance or to integrate 
effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment 
and our future financial performance.  
We rely extensively on information systems to proce ss transactions, summarize results and manage our b usiness. Disruptions in both 
our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could h arm our ability to run our business.  
Although we have independent, redundant and physica lly separate primary and secondary information syst ems, given the number of individual 
transactions we have each year, it is critical that  we maintain uninterrupted operation of our busines s-critical information systems. Our 
information systems, including our back-up systems,  are subject to damage or interruption from power o utages, computer and 
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worm s, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-ser vice attacks, security breaches 
(through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sop histicated organizations), catastrophic events such  as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and 
hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our information systems and our back-up systems are  damaged, breached or cease to function 
properly, we may have to make a significant  
 
21  
 
investment to repair or replace them, and we may su ffer interruptions in our operations in the interim . Any material interruption in both our 
information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are 
pursuing complex initiatives to transform our infor mation technology processes and systems, which will  include, for many of our information 
systems, establishing common processes across our l ines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system 
changes are undertaken, although we believe that ou r change management process will mitigate this risk . If we fail to integrate our information 
systems and processes, we may fail to realize the c ost savings anticipated to be derived from these in itiatives.  
Competitive and Reputational Risks  
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associa tes, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes i n laws and other labor issues could 
materially adversely affect our financial performan ce.  
Our ability to continue to expand our operations de pends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. 
Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positio ns that become vacant at our existing stores, 
clubs and distribution centers, while controlling o ur associate wage and related labor costs, is gener ally subject to numerous external factors, 
including the availability of a sufficient number o f qualified persons in the work force of the market s in which we are located, unemployment 
levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,  changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised 
employment and labor laws and regulations. If we ar e unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualifi ed personnel, the quality of service we 
provide to our customers may decrease and our finan cial performance may be adversely affected. The wag e increases for over 500,000 
associates in our operations in the U.S. and invest ment in other initiatives for our associates in the  U.S. that we announced in February 2015 
will increase our wage and other labor expenses sig nificantly. If the combined impact of the increase in our gross profit and decrease in certain 
operating expenses in fiscal 2015 and thereafter do es not offset the additional wage expense, our cons olidated operating income and our 
consolidated income from continuing operations coul d be less than our consolidated operating income an d consolidated income from 
continuing operations for recent fiscal years. In a ddition, if our costs of labor or related costs inc rease significantly for other reasons or if new 
or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or heal thcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financi al performance could be materially 
adversely affected.  
We face strong competition from other retailers and  wholesale club operators (whether through physical  retail, digital retail or 
through a combination of both areas), which could m aterially adversely affect our financial performanc e.  
The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, sto re sites, products and services and in 
other important aspects of its business with many o ther local, regional, national and global retailers , as well as other national and international 
internet-based retailers. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, departm ent, drug, dollar, variety and specialty 
stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and h ypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog busi nesses. Our Sam's Club segment 
competes with other wholesale club operators, as we ll as discount retailers, retail and wholesale groc ers and general merchandise wholesalers 
and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as int ernet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog busi nesses. Internationally, we compete with 
retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stor es, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, sup ercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, 
wholesale clubs, e-commerce and catalog businesses.  Such retailers, wholesale club operators and e-com merce retailers compete in a variety of 
ways, including the prices at which we sell our mer chandise, the merchandise selection and availabilit y, services offered to customers, location, 
store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping conve nience and overall shopping experience we offer, th e attractiveness and ease of use of our e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications,  speed of and options for delivery to our customers  of the merchandise they purchase 
from us online and the integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations. Where  necessary, to compete effectively with 
competitors who price merchandise at points lower t han the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we  will lower our prices on goods for 
sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competi tive pressures and changes in the retail markets co uld materially adversely affect our financial 
performance. See "Item 1. Business" above for addit ional discussion of our competitive situation in ea ch of our reportable segments.  
Although the retail industry as a whole is highly f ragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to 
time, which could result in increased competition a nd significantly alter the dynamics of the retail m arketplace. Such consolidation may result 
in competitors with greatly improved financial reso urces, improved access to merchandise, greater mark et penetration than they previously 
enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive  positions. Such business combinations could result  in the provision of a wider variety of 
products and services at competitive prices by such  consolidated companies, which could adversely affe ct our financial performance.  
 
22  
 
If the technology-based systems that give our custo mers the ability to shop with us online do not func tion effectively, our operating 
results, as well as our ability to grow our e-comme rce business globally, could be materially adversel y affected.  
Many of our customers shop with us over our e-comme rce websites and mobile commerce applications, incl uding walmart.com and 
samsclub.com, which are a part of our multi-channel  sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to 
shop online with us and with our competitors and to  do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media to interact with our 
customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales st rategy, we offer "Walmart Pickup" and 
"Club Pickup" programs under which many products av ailable for purchase online can be shipped to and p icked up by the customer at his or 
her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provid es additional customer traffic at such stores and c lubs. Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly 
evolving part of the retail industry and of our ope rations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in w hich our Walmart International segment 
operates. Any failure on our part to provide attrac tive, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer  a wide assortment of merchandise at 
competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations  of online shoppers and developments in 
online merchandising and related technology could p lace us at a competitive disadvantage, result in th e loss of e-commerce and other sales, 
harm our reputation with customers, have a material  adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce bus iness globally and could have a 
material adverse impact on our business and results  of operations.  
Data and Privacy Risks  
Any failure to maintain the security of the informa tion relating to our company, customers, associates  and vendors that we hold, 
whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our  information systems or otherwise, could damage our  reputation with customers, 
associates, vendors and others, could cause us to i ncur substantial additional costs and to become sub ject to litigation, and could 
materially adversely affect our operating results.  
As do most retailers, we receive and store in our d igital information systems certain personal informa tion about our customers, and we receive 
and store personal information concerning our assoc iates and vendors. We also utilize third-party serv ice providers for a variety of reasons, 
including, without limitation, encryption and authe ntication technology, content delivery to customers , back-office support, and other 
functions. In addition, our online operations at ww w.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and our websites in  certain of our foreign markets 
depend upon the secure transmission of confidential  information over public networks, including inform ation permitting cashless payments. 
Each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous attempts to access the informa tion stored in our information systems. 
We maintain substantial security measures to protec t, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such info rmation and have security processes, 
protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect informatio n from our systems to which they have 
access to under their engagements with us.  
As a result of these measures and our monitoring pr ocesses and procedures, we believe that past attemp ts by computer hackers, cyber terrorists 
and others to gain access to the information stored  on our information systems have been unsuccessful.  However, we or our third-party service 
providers may be unable to anticipate one or more o f the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticat ed means by which computer hackers, 
cyber terrorists and others may attempt to defeat o ur security measures or those of our third-party se rvice providers and breach our or our third-
party service providers information systems. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming incre asingly sophisticated. As cyber threats 
evolve and become more difficult to detect and succ essfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or 
those of our third-party service providers in the f uture and obtain the personal information of custom ers, associates and vendors that we hold or 
to which our third-party service providers have acc ess, and we or our third-party service providers ma y not discover any security breach and 
loss of information for a significant period of tim e after the security breach occurs. Moreover, assoc iate error or malfeasance, faulty password 
management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers’  security measures and breach our or our 
third-party service providers information systems ( whether digital or otherwise).  
Any breach of our security measures or those of our  third-party service providers and loss of our conf idential information, which could be 
undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and informatio n security laws and regulations could 
cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and t o restore customer confidence in us and 
to make changes to our information systems and admi nistrative processes to address security issues and  compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations.  
In addition, such events could materially adversely  affect our reputation with our customers, associat es, vendors and shareholders, as well as 
our operations, results of operations, financial co ndition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about 
our operations and financial condition and performa nce and could result in litigation against us or th e imposition of penalties or liabilities, 
which may not be covered by our insurance policies.  Moreover, a security breach could require us to de vote significant management resources 
to address the problems created by the security bre ach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures 
that we employ to guard such important personal inf ormation against cyberattacks and other attempts to  access such information and could 
result in a disruption of our operations, particula rly our digital retail operations.  
 
23  
 
As a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards fo r payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Indus try Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"), 
issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standa rds Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines  and standards with regard to our 
security surrounding the physical and electronic st orage, processing and transmission of individual ca rdholder data. By accepting debit cards 
for payment, we are also subject to compliance with  the American National Standards Institute encrypti on standards and payment network 
security operating guidelines. Even though we compl y with these guidelines and standards and other inf ormation security measures, we cannot 
be certain that the security measures we maintain t o protect all of our information technology systems  are able to prevent, contain or detect any 
cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches  from known malware or malware that may be develope d in the future. To the extent that any 
disruption results in the loss, damage or misapprop riation of information, we may be materially advers ely affected by claims from customers, 
financial institutions, regulatory authorities, pay ment card networks and others. In addition, the cos t of complying with stricter privacy and 
information security laws and standards could be si gnificant to us.  
Supply Chain and Third -Party Risks  
Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our p roducts are sourced and the safety of those product s could materially adversely 
affect our financial performance.  
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variet y of domestic and international suppliers. Global s ourcing of many of the products we sell 
is an important factor in our financial performance . All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and 
environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as m eeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers 
who meet our standards, and to access products in a  timely and efficient manner is a significant chall enge, especially with respect to suppliers 
located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Politica l and economic instability in the countries in whic h foreign suppliers are located, the 
financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' fail ure to meet our supplier standards (including our r esponsible sourcing standards), labor problems 
experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturer s, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, 
disruption in the transportation of merchandise fro m the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, cl ubs, and other facilities, including as a 
result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a ma terial amount of merchandise we purchase enters int o the U.S., currency exchange rates, 
transport availability and cost, transport security , inflation and other factors relating to the suppl iers and the countries in which they are located 
are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S.'s for eign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed 
on certain countries, the limitation on the importa tion of certain types of goods or of goods containi ng certain materials from other countries 
and other factors relating to foreign trade are bey ond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products 
could adversely affect our financial performance.  
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe  products. Concerns regarding the safety of food an d non-food products that we source 
from our suppliers and then sell could cause custom ers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, o r to seek alternative sources of supply for 
all of their food and non- food needs, even if the basis for the concern is ou tside of our control. Any lost confidence on the pa rt of our customers 
would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As su ch, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the 
cause, could adversely affect our financial perform ance.  
Legal, Regulatory and Other External Risks  
Our Walmart International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, ac counting, regulatory, political and 
economic risks and conditions specific to the count ries or regions in which we operate, which could ad versely affect our business or 
financial performance.  
We are currently engaged in the operation of retail  through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in  Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, 
China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom; our maj ority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Centr al America, China and Mexico; and 
our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiarie s in China. During fiscal 2015 , our Walmart Intern ational operations generated 
approximately 28% of our consolidated net sales. As  a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the U.S., we expect that our 
Walmart International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these 
countries or in other countries or regions througho ut the world could be negatively affected by a vari ety of factors, most of which are beyond 
our control. These factors include political condit ions, including political instability, local and gl obal economic conditions, legal and regulatory 
constraints, tax regulations, local labor laws, ant i-money laundering laws and regulations, trade poli cies, currency regulations, and other 
matters in any of the countries or regions in which  we operate, now or in the future.  
In particular, Brazilian federal, state and local l aws are complex and subject to varying interpretati ons. Although the Company believes it 
complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiarie s in Brazil are party to a large number of labor cl aims and non-income tax assessments, 
which have arisen during the normal course of busin ess in Brazil. These matters are subject to inheren t uncertainties and if decided adversely to 
the Company, could adversely affect our financial p erformance.  
Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in  which we have operations have in the past suffered  from high rates of inflation and 
currency devaluations, which, if they occurred agai n, could adversely affect our financial performance . Other  
 
24  
 
factors which may impact our Walmart International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fisc al policies both of the U.S. and of other 
countries, laws, regulations and other activities o f foreign governments, agencies and similar organiz ations, and risks associated with having 
numerous facilities located in countries which have  historically been less stable than the U.S. Additi onal risks inherent in our Walmart 
International operations generally include, among o thers, the costs and difficulties of managing inter national operations, adverse tax 
consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing in tellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing 
business in the U.S. generally also exist when doin g business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggera ted by the difficulty of doing business in 
numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences  in culture, laws and regulations.  
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a  risk exists that our associates, contractors or ag ents could, in contravention of our policies, 
engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. law s and regulations applicable to us, such as the For eign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws 
and regulations of other countries such as the UK B ribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such b usiness practices and have in place 
enhanced global anti- corruption compliance programs designed to ensure c ompliance with these laws and regulations. Neverthe less, we remain 
subject to the risk that one or more of our associa tes, contractors or agents, including those based i n or from countries where practices that 
violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary , will engage in business practices that 
are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our comp liance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws  and regulations. Any such violations, 
even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performa nce.  
Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-poli tical events could adversely affect our financial p erformance.  
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, su ch as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical stor ms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather 
conditions such as major or extended winter storms,  droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of cli mate change or otherwise, severe changes 
in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which w e operate or in which our suppliers are 
located could adversely affect our operations and f inancial performance. Such events could result in p hysical damage to, or the complete loss 
of, one or more of our properties, the closure of o ne or more stores, clubs and distribution facilitie s, the lack of an adequate work force in a 
market, the inability of customers and our associat es to reach or have transportation to our stores an d clubs directly affected by such events, the 
evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are locat ed, changes in the purchasing patterns of 
consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long- term disruption in the supply of products from some  local and overseas 
suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods  from overseas, the disruption or delay in the deli very of goods to our distribution facilities or 
stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in ou r stores, the disruption of utility services to 
our stores and our facilities, and disruption in ou r communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and 
adversely affect our operations in the areas in whi ch these types of events occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012, or numerous 
winter storm systems in the U.S. in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and could adversely affect our financial perf ormance.  
In light of the substantial premiums payable for in surance coverage for losses caused by certain natur al disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, 
typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well a s the limitations on available coverage for 
such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self- insured with respect to such losses. Although we ma intain certain specific coverages for losses 
from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of 
losses that would be incurred as a result of any ph ysical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores , clubs and distribution facilities, loss or 
spoilage of inventory, and business interruption ca used by any such events below catastrophic levels o f coverage, as well as in the event of a 
catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of a pplicable coverages. Significant losses caused by s uch events could materially adversely 
affect our financial performance.  
We are subject to certain legal proceedings that ma y materially adversely affect our results of operat ions, financial condition and 
liquidity.  
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, w hich include consumer, employment, tort and other l itigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if 
decided adversely to us or settled by us, may resul t in liability material to our results of operation s, financial condition and liquidity. We are 
currently a defendant in a number of cases containi ng class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs  have brought claims under federal and 
state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of ca ses containing class-action allegations in which th e plaintiffs have brought claims under 
federal and state consumer laws. In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of  the Company, has been named as a 
defendant in over 4,000 "equal value" claims that a re pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (t he "Employment Tribunal") in the 
United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work p erformed by female employees in 
ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of,  among other things, the demands of their jobs to t hat of male employees working in ASDA's 
warehouses and distribution facilities, and that th e disparity in pay between these different job posi tions is not objectively justified. The 
claimants are seeking: (i) back pay consisting of t he difference between the wage rate paid in the sto res and the rate paid in the warehouses and 
distribution facilities for the period of their emp loyment up to a maximum of six years under the stat ute of limitations; and (ii) an increase in 
the store rate prospectively, to match that paid in  the warehouses and the  
 
25  
 
distribution facilities. On January 30, 2015, the E mployment Tribunal held a case management conferenc e in order to set a schedule for 
addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issu es involved in the first phase of the litigation. A t this time, it is undetermined: (i) how many 
of these claims may ultimately be filed; or (ii) wh ether the Employment Tribunal will decide to hear e ach claim individually or to consolidate 
them into groups of similar claims and proceed with  the trial of "test cases." Determinations made in such test cases, if any, might be asserted 
as binding in subsequent trials of claims within th at group and any subsequent claims involving the sa me issues. Moreover, a determination as 
to the appropriate rate of pay for a particular sto re position might be asserted as the basis for addi tional claims for back pay or wage increases 
by other store associates who perform, or who have performed, like work in that position. On March 23,  2015, ASDA asked the Employment 
Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that t he High Court, which is the superior first instance  civil court in the UK that is headquartered 
in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of Londo n, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March 23, 2015, 
ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to "strike out" substantially all of the claims for failing to  comply with Employment Tribunal 
rules. We discuss this case and other litigation to  which we are party in greater detail below under t he caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and 
in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financ ial Statements", which are part of our Annual Repor t to Shareholders, which are 
incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this An nual Report on Form 10-K.  
We could be subject to liability, penalties and oth er sanctions and other adverse consequences arising  out of our on-going FCPA 
matter.  
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, whic h is composed solely of independent directors, is c onducting an internal investigation 
into, among other things, alleged violations of the  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other a lleged crimes or misconduct in 
connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries , including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately 
handled prior allegations of such violations and/or  misconduct. We are also conducting a voluntary glo bal review of our policies, practices and 
internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthe ning our global anti-corruption compliance programs . Since the implementation of the 
global review and enhanced anti-corruption complian ce programs, the Audit Committee and we have identi fied or been made aware of 
additional allegations regarding potential violatio ns of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regardi ng allegations of potential FCPA violations 
have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to,  Brazil, China and India. In November 
2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative ac tivity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ" ) and the SEC, and we have been 
informed by the DOJ and the SEC that we are the sub ject of their respective investigations into possib le violations of the FCPA. A number of 
federal and local government agencies in Mexico hav e also initiated investigations of these matters. F urthermore, lawsuits relating to the 
matters under investigation have been filed by seve ral of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers 
and certain of Walmex's current and former officers .  
We could be exposed to a variety of negative conseq uences as a result of these matters. One or more en forcement actions could be instituted in 
respect of the matters that are the subject of some  or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in 
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctio ns, cease and desist orders, debarment or other rel ief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. 
The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuit s may result in judgments against us and our curren t and former directors and officers 
named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at th is time the outcome or impact of the government inv estigations, the shareholder lawsuits, 
or our own internal investigations and review. More over, we expect to continue to incur costs (increme ntal to the $173 million of costs incurred 
in fiscal 2015) in conducting our on-going review a nd investigations and in responding to requests for  information or subpoenas seeking 
documents, testimony and other information in conne ction with the government investigations and in def ending the existing and any additional 
shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedin gs that are instituted against us or any of our cur rent or former officers. These matters 
may require the involvement of certain members of o ur senior management that could impinge on the time  they have available to devote to 
other matters relating to our business. We also exp ect that there will be ongoing media and government al interest, including additional news 
articles from media publications on these matters t hat could impact the perception of our role as a co rporate citizen among certain audiences. 
Our process of assessing and responding to the gove rnmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuit s continues. While we believe that it is 
probable that we will incur a loss from these matte rs, given the on-going nature and complexity of the  review, inquiries and investigations, we 
cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of los s that may arise from these matters. Although we do  not presently believe that these matters 
will have a material adverse affect on our business , given the inherent uncertainties in such situatio ns, we can provide no assurance that these 
matters will not be material to our business in the  future.  
None.  
 
26  ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  
 
The number of supercenters, discount stores, Neighb orhood Markets, other small formats and Sam's Clubs  located in each state or territory of 
the U.S. and the number of units located in each of  the geographic markets internationally in which we  operate are disclosed as of the fiscal 
year ended January 31, 2015 in the part of our Annual Report to Shareholde rs under the caption "Unit Counts as of January 31,  2015 " that is 
an exhibit hereto and that information is incorpora ted herein by reference. The following table provid es further details of our retail units and 
distribution facilities, including return facilitie s, as of January 31, 2015 : 
We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas t hat serve as our principal office and lease office facilities throughout the U.S. for operations 
and field management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Compan y. We use independent contractors to 
construct our buildings. All store leases provide f or annual rentals, some of which escalate during th e original lease or provide for additional 
rent based on sales volume. Substantially all of th e Company's store and club leases have renewal opti ons, some of which include escalation 
clauses causing an increase in rents.

I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled 
"Contingencies," which is one of the Notes to Conso lidated Financial Statements incorporated by refere nce in Part II, Item 8. Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Re port on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference in this item. We refer you to that 
discussion for important information concerning tho se legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief 
sought. We provide the following additional informa tion concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in 
which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which  the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.  
Wage-and-Hour Class Action: Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart , Ct. of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, PA, 3/2 0/02 and 8/30/04; Superior 
Ct. of PA, Eastern Dist., Philadelphia, PA, 12/7/07 ; Supreme Ct. of PA, Harrisburg, PA, 10/9/11.  
ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2 008 & Others-Manchester Employment Tribunal).  
II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in w hich the complaints closely track the 
allegations set forth in a news story that appeared  in The New York Times ( the " Times " ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities 
lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the Unite d States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to 
the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plai ntiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreig n Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") 
beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sectio ns 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act o f 1934, as amended, relating to certain 
prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff see ks to represent a class of shareholders who purchas ed or acquired stock of the Company 
between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and s eeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected 
the value of such stock. In addition, a number of d erivative complaints have been filed in Delaware an d Arkansas, also tracking the allegations 
of the Times story, and naming various current and former office rs and directors as additional defendants. The plai ntiffs in the derivative suits 
(in which the Company is a nominal defendant) alleg e, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the 
Company breached their fiduciary duties in connecti on with oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the de rivative suits have been combined 
into two consolidated proceedings, one of which is currently pending in the Western District of Arkans as and the other in the Delaware Court 
of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the United States D istrict Court for the Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants’ motion to 
dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. Management does not believe any possibl e loss or the range of any possible loss 
that may be incurred in connection with these proce edings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

28  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
 
III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S- K requires disclosure of certain environmental matt ers. The following 
matters are disclosed in accordance with that requi rement. For the matters listed below, management do es not believe any possible loss or the 
range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the  aggregate, will be material to the 
Company’s financial condition or results of operati ons.  
Between April 2014 and October 2014, the Sustainabi lity Development Ministry of the Municipality of Ju arez in Nuevo León, Mexico, notified 
a subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal- Mart de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., that there were  environmental concerns with the operations at 10 
stores. These concerns included but were not limite d to the failure to have the appropriate number of trees planted on the property, failure to 
have appropriate perimeter fencing, and lack of pro per zoning permits for some stores. The Company res olved this with the agency by paying a 
penalty of approximately $333,000 and implementing steps to address the concerns.  
In 2014, the Environmental and Natural History Mini stry of Chiapas, Mexico, notified a subsidiary of t he Company, Arrendadora de Centros 
Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V., that four stores m ay have been constructed without first obtaining an  environmental impact license as 
required, and for failing to comply with conditions  required by those licenses. The Ministry has propo sed a penalty of approximately $857,000 
and has required the Company to obtain the licenses  and comply with the conditions.  
In September 2014, a spill of approximately 50 lite rs of fuel occurred at a store in Lerma, Mexico. A subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-
Mart de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., took steps to a ddress the spill and engaged an expert to oversee t he final cleanup. The Municipality of 
Lerma proposed a penalty of approximately $128,000 along with implementation of a monitoring program a round the spill area to address the 
situation.  
In February 2014, a division of the Health Departme nt of the City of Vitória notified WMS Supermercado s do Brasil Ltda ("Walmart Brazil"), 
a subsidiary of the Company, that a wastewater leak  had been observed in the parking lot of a store. W almart Brazil immediately took steps to 
address the situation and is cooperating with the a gency to resolve the issue.

Our common stock is primarily traded in the U.S. on  the New York Stock Exchange. At March 30, 2015 , the latest practicable date, there were 
249,876 common stock shareholders of record.  
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares o f its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of 
Directors. On June 6, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion share  repurchase program, which had 
approximately $712 million of remaining authorizati on for share repurchases as of that date, with a ne w $15.0 billion share repurchase 
program, announced on June 7, 2013. As was the case  with the replaced share repurchase program, the cu rrent share repurchase program has no 
expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurc hases. At January 31, 2015 , 
authorization for $10.3 billion of share repurchase s remained under the current share repurchase progr am. Any repurchased shares are 
constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.  
For the three months ended January 31, 2015 , the C ompany did not repurchase shares of its common stoc k under the share repurchase 
program.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that  are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be 
timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated t o management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and 
procedures, we recognize that any controls and proc edures, no matter how well designed and operated, c an provide only reasonable assurance 
of achieving the desired control objectives. Our ma nagement is necessarily required to use judgment in  evaluating controls and procedures. 
Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entitie s. Since we do not control or manage those entities , our controls and procedures with 
respect to those entities are substantially more li mited than those we maintain with respect to our co nsolidated subsidiaries.  
In the ordinary course of business, we review our i nternal control over financial reporting and make c hanges to our systems and processes to 
improve such controls and increase efficiency, whil e ensuring that we maintain an effective internal c ontrol environment. Changes may include 
such activities as implementing new, more efficient  systems, updating existing systems, automating man ual processes, migrating certain 
processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not 
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company ’s internal control over financial reporting. Howev er, they allow us to continue to enhance 
our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective.  
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design an d operation of our disclosure controls and procedur es as of the end of the period covered by 
this report was performed under the supervision and  with the participation of management, including ou r Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed  by the Company in the reports that it 
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicate d to management, including our 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer , as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regardi ng required disclosure and are effective to 
provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported wit hin the time periods specified by the 
SEC's rules and forms.

(i)  the acquisition of Control of Wal- Mart by a person pursuant to a general offer 
(a)  to acquire the whole of the issued ordinary sh ares of Wal- Mart not already held by that person or a person co nnected 
to that person, such offer having been made on a co ndition such that, if it was met, that person 
would obtain Control of Wal-Mart, or  
 
provided that any condition subject to which the of fer is made has been satisfied; or  
 
6 Current HMRC guidance indicates that Rule 8.3 will only apply to Options granted on/after 20 March 201 5, the date the rules were amended.  
 (b)  to acquire all the shares in Wal- Mart of the same class as the Shares (not already h eld by that person or a person 
connected to that person)  
(ii)  the sale of more than half of the issued share capi tal of the Company or the undertaking of the busine ss of the Company to 
any company which is not an Associated Company of W al-Mart.  
8.2  Subject to the Option not having lapsed under Rule 7.2, if, in consequence of Wal- Mart coming under the Control of another person as 
set out in paragraph 37(6C)(a) of Schedule 3, the s hares in Wal- Mart to which an Option relates no longer meet the requirements of 
Part 4 of Schedule 3, the Option may be exercised n o later than 20 days after the day on which such pe rson obtains such Control, 
notwithstanding that the shares no longer meet thos e requirements (and see Rule 7.2(H) regarding time of lapsing).  
8.3  In addition to Rules 8.1 and 8.2, an Option which i s exercised no earlier than 20 days before the rele vant date for the purposes of 
paragraph 37(2) of Schedule 3 is to be treated as i f it had been exercised in accordance with Rule 8.1 (i) PROVIDED THAT any such 
exercise in anticipation shall be treated as having  had no effect if the relevant date for the purpose s of paragraph 37(2) of Schedule 3 
does not fall within the period of 20 days beginnin g with the date on which the Option is exercised 6 .  
8.4  For the purposes of Rule 8 
(A)  " connected " has the meaning given in section 718 ITEPA; and 
(B)  a person is to be treated as obtaining Control of a  company if that person and others acting in concer t together obtain Control 
of it.  
8.5  For the purposes of Rule 8.1(i), it does not matter  if the general offer is made to different sharehol ders by different means. 
9.  Grant of New Options 
9.1  If an Acquiring Company obtains Control of Wal -Mart or acquires the shares or business of the Comp any in the circumstances set out 
in Rule 8.1 the Option Holder may at any time withi n the six month period beginning with the date refe rred to in Rule 8.1 by 
agreement with the Acquiring Company release any un exercised Option ("Old Option") then held by him in  consideration for the grant 
to him of a New Option.  
 
 9.2  A New Option shall be -
(A)  for such a number of New Shares as shall have subst antially the same total Market Value immediately af ter the Release Date 
as the total Market Value of the Shares which were the subject of the Old Option immediately before th e Release 
Date PROVIDED THAT if the Shares are subject to a Restriction, the Mar ket Value for these purposes shall be 
determined as if they were not subject to the Restr iction,  
(B)  exercisable in the same manner as the Old Option, 
(C)  deemed to have been granted on the Date of Grant of  the corresponding Old Option, and 
(D)  subject to the provisions of the Sharesave Plan as it had effect immediately before the Release Date b ut so that (save and 
except for Rules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14.4 and 15) refere nces to the "Company" and "Wal- Mart" shall be construed as 
references to the "New Company" and references to " Options" shall be construed as references to "New O ptions."  
9.3  The total amount payable by an Option Holder upon t he exercise of the New Option shall be substantiall y the same as the total amount 
that would have been payable by him upon the exerci se of the Old Option.  
9.4  For the purposes of this Rule 9, the Market Value o f any shares shall be determined using a methodolog y agreed by HMRC. 
10.  Exercise of Options 
10.1  In order to exercise an Option in whole or in  part the Option Holder must:-
(A)  Give notice (which may be in electronic form) to th e Company Secretary (or the person appointed by the  Board for the 
purpose), in such manner as the Company may from ti me to time require and notify to Option Holders.  
(B)  The notice must be accompanied by payment in full o f the Option Price or must authorise the Appropriat e Authority to make 
such payment on behalf of the Option Holder.  
10.2  An Option may be exercised in whole or in part prov ided that partial exercise shall be of not less tha n 10 per cent of the Shares 
comprised in the Option.  
10.3  The date the Exercise Notice is received in accorda nce with Rule 10.1 shall constitute for all purpose s the Receipt Date of such 
Option. The Company will ensure that the Option is exercised within 30 Business Days of the Receipt Da te.  
10.4  If the Option becomes exercisable before the releva nt Bonus Date it shall be exercisable over not more  than the number of Shares the 
aggregate Option Price of which is as nearly as pos sible equal to but not more than the total repaymen t due on the Receipt Date and 
the Option shall not be exercisable over any Shares  in excess of that number.  
 
 
7 Finance Act 2014 removed the requirement for HMRC t o approve adjustments in these circumstances, howev er HMRC guidance (ESSUM 35160) still states that: " where there is 
a variation in the share capital of the company, th e agreement of HMRC's Shares & Assets Valuation mus t be secured."  
 10.5  All allotments and issues or transfers of Shares (a s the case may be) will be made within 30 Business Days of the Receipt Date and 
will be subject to all (if any) necessary consents of any governmental or other authorities under enac tments or regulations for the time 
being in force. It shall be the responsibility of t he Option Holder to comply with any requirements to  be fulfilled in order to obtain or 
obviate the necessity for any such consent. A share  certificate or such other form of acknowledgment o f shareholding as is then 
prescribed in respect of such Shares so issued or t ransferred shall be sent to the person exercising t he Option at his risk.  
10.6  If under the terms of an announcement made by  Wal-Mart a dividend is to be or is proposed to be paid to the holders of Shares, the 
Shares to be issued on the exercise of an Option af ter the date of such announcement will not rank for  such dividend and the Shares to 
be transferred on the exercise of an Option after t he date of such announcement will be transferred wi thout the right to receive any 
such dividend and any such right to that dividend w ill be retained by the transferor. Subject as afore said the Shares so to be issued 
shall be identical and rank pari passu in all respe cts with the fully paid registered Shares in issue on the Receipt Date.  
10.7  Where the Shares are listed on the New York Stock E xchange or any other market or recognised investmen t exchange as defined in 
section 285 of the Financial Services and Markets A ct 2000, the Board shall as soon as practicable app ly to the New York Stock 
Exchange for admission of such Shares to the New Yo rk Stock Exchange or such other market or recognise d investment exchange (as 
appropriate).  
11.  Variation of Capital 
11.1  Upon the occurrence of an Issue or Variation the re striction on the number of Shares available for the  offer of Options set out in Rule 
3.1 and the number or nominal amount of Shares comp rised in each Option and the Option Price may be ad justed in such manner as 
the Board may determine 7 PROVIDED THAT :-  
(A)  other than in the event of a capitalisation issue, written confirmation of the Auditors is obtained th at in their opinion the 
adjustments are fair and reasonable,  
(B)  the total Market Value of the Shares over which an Option subsists is substantially the same immediate ly before and 
immediately after the adjustment,  
(C)  the total amount payable on the exercise of an Opti on in full is substantially the same immediately be fore and immediately 
after the adjustment, and  
(D)  if it is intended that this Sharesave Plan shall co ntinue to be a Schedule 3 SAYE Option Scheme, no ad justment shall be 
made which would result in the requirements of Sche dule 3 not being met in relation to an Option.  
 
Subject to the Option not having lapsed under Rule 7.2, if the Company convenes a general meeting for the purpose of considering a 
resolution for voluntary winding up, the Board shal l notify Option Holders of the date of such meeting  and Options may be exercised 
within 28 days of the passing of the resolution. To  the extent unexercised, Options shall lapse upon t he passing of the resolution. In the 
event that the resolution is not passed, any purpor ted exercise of Options shall be invalid.  
 11.2  For the purposes of this paragraph, if the Shares a re subject to a Restriction, the Market Value shall  be determined as if they were not 
subject to the Restriction.  
11.3  Notice of any such adjustment shall be given to the  Option Holder by the Board, which may be in electr onic form and may call in 
Option certificates for endorsement or replacement.   
12.  Winding Up

13.4  For the purposes of the Sharesave Plan, an e- mail shall be treated as not having been duly sent or received if the recipient of such e-

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Fin ancial Condition and Results of Operations  
Overview  
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in the operation of retail, wholes ale and other units in various formats 
around the world. Our operations consist of three r eportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart Internati onal and Sam's Club.  
Each of our segments contributes to the Company's o perating results differently, but each has generall y maintained a consistent contribution 
rate to the Company's net sales and operating incom e in recent years.  
Through the operations in each of our segments, we help people around the world save money and live be tter – anytime and anywhere – in 
retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving t o create a customer-centric experience 
that seamlessly integrates digital and physical sho pping. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mo rtar presence in each of the markets we 
operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-comme rce websites and mobile commerce applications. Each  week, we serve nearly 260 million 
customers who visit our over 11,000 stores under 72  banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in  11 countries. Our strategy is to lead 
on price, invest to differentiate on access, be com petitive on assortment and deliver a great experien ce. By leading on price we earn the trust of 
our customers every day by providing a broad assort ment of quality merchandise and services at everyda y low prices ("EDLP"), while 
fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutua l respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pri cing philosophy under which we price 
items at a low price every day so our customers tru st that our prices will not change under frequent p romotional activity. Price leadership is 
core to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is o ur commitment to control expenses so those cost sav ings can be passed along to our 
customers. Our digital and physical presence provid es customers access to our broad assortment anytime  and anywhere. We strive to give our 
customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.  
Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our U.S. and  Canadian operations. We consolidate all other oper ations generally using a one-month lag 
and on a calendar year basis. Our business is seaso nal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as 
weather patterns. Historically, our highest sales v olume and operating income have occurred in the fis cal quarter ending January 31 .  
This discussion, which presents our results for the  fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 "), January 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014 ") and 
January 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013 "), should be read i n conjunction with our Consolidated Financial State ments and the accompanying notes. We 
intend for this discussion to provide the reader wi th information that will assist in understanding ou r financial statements, the changes in certain 
key items in those financial statements from period  to period and the primary factors that accounted f or those changes. We also discuss certain 
performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discus sion provides information about the 
financial results of the three segments of our busi ness to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of 
operations affect the financial condition and resul ts of operations of the Company as a whole.  
Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysi s of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  we discuss segment operating 
income, comparable store and club sales and other m easures. Management measures the results of the Com pany's segments using each 
segment's operating income, including certain corpo rate overhead allocations, as well as other measure s. From time to time, we revise the 
measurement of each segment's operating income, inc luding certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the 
information regularly reviewed by our chief operati ng decision maker. When we do so, the previous peri od amounts and balances are 
reclassified to conform to the current period's pre sentation. The  
 
3  •  Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates  retail stores in all 50 states in the United State s ("U.S."), Washington D.C. and 
Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as w ell as digital retail. Walmart U.S. generated appro ximately 60% of our net sales in 
fiscal 2015 and, of our three segments, Walmart U.S . is the largest and has historically had the highe st gross profit as a percentage of 
net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walma rt U.S. has historically contributed the greatest a mount to the Company's net sales 
and operating income.  
•  Walmart International consists of operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and includes retai l, wholesale and other businesses. 
These businesses consist of numerous formats, inclu ding supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, ware house clubs, including Sam's 
Clubs, cash & carry, home improvement, specialty el ectronics, restaurants, apparel stores, drug stores  and convenience stores, as well 
as digital retail. Walmart International generated approximately 28% of our fiscal 2015 net sales. The  overall gross profit rate for 
Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart  U.S. because of its merchandise mix. Walmart Inter national is our second largest 
segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well  as by adding retail, wholesale and other units.  
•  Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse  clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in  Puerto Rico, as well as digital 
retail. Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2015 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership 
income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate 
and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net  sales than our other segments.

amounts disclosed for "Corporate and support" in th e leverage discussion of the Company's performance metrics consist of corporate overhead 
and other items not allocated to any of the Company 's segments.  
Comparable store and club sales is a metric that in dicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores  and clubs by measuring the change in 
sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commer ce sales, for a particular period from the correspo nding period in the previous year. 
Walmart's definition of comparable store and club s ales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including 
remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as e-commerce sales. We measure the e-comme rce sales impact by including those 
sales initiated through our websites and fulfilled through our e-commerce distribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online, 
but fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Changes  in format are excluded from comparable store and c lub sales when the conversion is 
accompanied by a relocation or expansion that resul ts in a change in retail square feet of more than f ive percent. Comparable store and club 
sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by  others within the retail industry. The method of c alculating comparable store and club sales 
varies across the retail industry. As a result, our  calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled 
measures reported by other companies.  
In discussing our operating results, the term curre ncy exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating 
results for all countries where the functional curr ency is not the U.S. dollar. We calculate the effec t of changes in currency exchange rates as 
the difference between current period activity tran slated using the current period's currency exchange  rates, and the comparable prior year 
period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our di scussion, we refer to the results of this calculati on as the impact of currency exchange rate 
fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency op erating results, we are referring to our operating results without the impact of the currency 
exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact o f acquisitions until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods. The disclosure 
of constant currency amounts or results permits inv estors to understand better Walmart's underlying pe rformance without the effects of 
currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions . Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and 
operating income, of the Company and the Walmart In ternational segment in the future.  
We made certain reclassifications to prior period a mounts or balances to conform to the presentation i n the current fiscal year. These 
reclassifications did not impact the Company's oper ating income or consolidated net income. Additional ly, certain prior period segment asset 
and expense allocations have been reclassified amon g segments to be comparable with the current period  presentation.  
The Retail Industry  
We operate in the highly competitive retail industr y in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sa les competition from other discount, 
department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty sto res, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as e -commerce and catalog businesses. Many 
of these competitors are national, regional or inte rnational chains or have a national or internationa l online presence. We compete with a 
number of companies for prime retail site locations , as well as in attracting and retaining quality em ployees (whom we call "associates"). We, 
along with other retail companies, are influenced b y a number of factors including, but not limited to : catastrophic events, weather, competitive 
pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer deb t levels and buying patterns, consumer credit avail ability, cost of goods, currency 
exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, d eflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, genera l economic conditions, insurance costs, 
interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecuri ty attacks and unemployment. Further information on  the factors that can affect our operating 
results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be located in "Ite m 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 , and in the discussion under "Cautionary Stat ement Regarding Forward-Looking 
Statements and Information" in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 20 15 .  
Company Performance Metrics  
Our performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value: growth, leverage a nd returns. Our priority of growth 
focuses on sales through growth in net sales, compa rable store and club sales, including e-commerce sa les, and unit square feet growth; the 
priority of leverage encompasses our objective to i ncrease our operating income at the same rate as or  a faster rate than the growth in net sales 
by growing our operating, selling, general and admi nistrative expenses ("operating expenses") at a slo wer rate than the growth of our net sales; 
and the priority of returns focuses on how efficien tly we employ assets through return on investment a nd how effectively we manage working 
capital through free cash flow. While all three pri orities are important, our top priority is growth, with increased investment in digital retail and 
our associates. Sales growth will contribute to imp roving leverage and returns over time.

Growth  
Net Sales  
Our consolidated net sales increased 1.9% and 1.6% for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively, when compa red to the previous fiscal year. The 
increase in net sales for fiscal 2015 was primarily  due to 3.0% year-over-year growth in retail square  feet, positive comparable sales in the U.S. 
and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. The  increase was partially offset by $5.3 billion of n egative impact from fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates for fiscal 2015 . The incre ase in net sales for fiscal 2014 was due to 3.1% gr owth in retail square feet, higher e-
commerce sales, the impact of fiscal 2013 acquisiti ons and positive comparable club sales at Sam's Clu b. The increase in net sales for fiscal 
2014 was partially offset by $5.1 billion of negati ve impact from fluctuations in currency exchange ra tes.  
Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales  
Comparable store and club sales is a metric which i ndicates the performance of our existing U.S. store s and clubs by measuring the change in 
sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commer ce sales, for a particular period over the correspo nding period in the previous year. The 
retail industry generally reports comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar (also know n as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent 
with the retail industry, we provide comparable sto re and club sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when 
we discuss our comparable store and club sales belo w, we are referring to our calendar comparable stor e and club sales calculated using our 
fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs fro m the retail calendar, our calendar comparable stor e and club sales also differ from the retail 
calendar comparable store and club sales provided i n our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar compara ble store and club sales, as well as the 
impact of fuel, for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , were as follows:  
 
Comparable store and club sales in the U.S., includ ing fuel, increased 0.5% in fiscal 2015 and decreas ed 0.5% in fiscal 2014 , when compared 
to the previous fiscal year. The fiscal 2015 total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positivel y impacted by higher traffic and lower gas 
prices during the end of the fiscal year. E-commerc e sales positively impacted comparable sales approx imately 0.3% and 0.2% for Walmart 
U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for the fiscal y ear ended January 31, 2015 . For fiscal 2014, the t otal U.S. comparable store and club sales 
were negatively impacted by lower consumer spending  primarily due to the slow recovery in general econ omic conditions, the 2% increase in 
the 2013 payroll tax rate, and the reduction in gov ernment food benefits and severe winter storms that  occurred during the fourth quarter. These 
factors were partially offset by increased member t raffic at Sam's Club primarily coming from Savings Members. Additionally, e-commerce 
sales positively impacted the Walmart U.S. comparab le store and Sam's Club comparable club sales perce ntages by approximately 0.3% for 
fiscal 2014.  
 
As we continue to add new stores and clubs in the U .S., we do so with an understanding that additional  stores and clubs may take sales away 
from existing units. We estimate the negative impac t on comparable store and club sales as a result of  opening new stores and clubs was 
approximately 0.9% and 0.8% in fiscal  2015  and 20 14 , respectively. Our estimate is calculated primaril y by comparing the sales trends of the 
impacted stores and clubs, which are identified bas ed on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores 
and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened.

Leverage  
Operating Income  
We believe comparing both the growth of our operati ng expenses and our operating income to the growth of our net sales are meaningful 
measures, as they indicate how effectively we manag e costs and leverage operating expenses. Our object ive for a fiscal year is to grow 
operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales and to grow operating income at the same rate as or  a faster rate than net sales. On occasion, 
we may make strategic growth investments that may, at times, cause our operating expenses to grow at a  faster rate than net sales and that may 
result in our operating income growing at a slower rate than net sales.  
Operating Expenses  
For fiscal 2015 , operating expenses increased 2.3%  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, while  net sales increased 1.9% , respectively, 
when compared to the previous fiscal year. Accordin gly, we did not meet our objective of growing opera ting expenses at a slower rate than net 
sales. Our continued investments in digital retail,  higher health-care expenses in the U.S. from incre ased enrollment and medical cost inflation, 
the $249 million impact of wage and hour litigation  in the U.S., as well as expenses of $148 million r elated to the closure of approximately 30 
underperforming stores in Japan were the primary fa ctors that caused us not to leverage for fiscal 201 5 . For fiscal 2014 , we did not meet our 
objective of growing operating expenses at a slower  rate than net sales as operating expenses as a per centage of net sales increased 27 basis 
points. Overall, lower than anticipated sales, high er investment in key areas, such as global leverage  and digital retail initiatives, and the nearly 
$1.0 billion of increased expenses for various matt ers described in the Walmart International segment discussion, were the primary cause for 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales.  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Compan y announced a new associate wage structure combined  with comprehensive associate 
training and educational programs. We anticipate th e additional expenses in fiscal 2016 resulting from  these programs will be approximately 
$1.0 billion, which may impact our ability to lever age operating expenses in fiscal 2016.  
Operating Income  
For fiscal 2015 , we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at the same rate or a fast er rate than net sales as operating income 
increased 1.0% , while net sales increased 1.9% whe n compared to the previous fiscal year. This was pr imarily due to the factors we discussed 
for not leveraging operating expenses. For fiscal 2 014 , we also did not meet our objective of growing  operating income at a faster rate than net 
sales as operating income decreased 3.1% while net sales increased 1.6%, when compared to the previous  fiscal year. This was primarily due to 
the factors we discussed for not leveraging operati ng expenses, partially offset by increases in membe rship and other income of 5.6%.

Returns  
Return on Investment  
Management believes return on investment ("ROI") is  a meaningful metric to share with investors becaus e it helps investors assess how 
effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends  in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balan ces long-term potential strategic 
initiatives with possible short-term impacts.  
ROI was 16.9% and 17.0% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The sligh t change in ROI was primarily due to 
continued investments in store growth and digital r etail initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate  fluctuations.  
We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operati ng income plus interest income, depreciation and am ortization, and rent expense) for the 
trailing 12 months divided by average invested capi tal during that period. We consider average investe d capital to be the average of our 
beginning and ending total assets, plus average acc umulated depreciation and average amortization, les s average accounts payable and average 
accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent fa ctor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trail ing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. 
When we have discontinued operations, we exclude th e impact of the discontinued operations.  
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP fin ancial measure because we calculate ROI using finan cial measures that exclude and 
include amounts that are included and excluded in t he most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For example, we exclude the impact 
of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of ou r calculation of ROI. In addition, we 
include a factor of eight for rent expense that est imates the hypothetical capitalization of our opera ting leases. We consider return on assets 
("ROA") to be the financial measure computed in acc ordance with generally accepted accounting principl es ("GAAP") that is the most directly 
comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated in come from continuing operations for 
the period divided by average total assets of conti nuing operations for the period) because ROI: adjus ts operating income to exclude certain 
expense items and adds interest income; adjusts tot al assets of continuing operations for the impact o f accumulated depreciation and 
amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilit ies; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at  total invested capital.  
Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numero us methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. A s a result, the method used by 
management to calculate our ROI may differ from the  methods used by other companies to calculate their  ROI. We urge you to understand the 
methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI before comparing our ROI to that of such other companies.

Free Cash Flow  
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial m easure. Management believes, however, that free cas h flow, which measures our ability 
to generate additional cash from our business opera tions, is an important financial measure for use in  evaluating the Company's financial 
performance. Free cash flow should be considered in  addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cons olidated income from continuing 
operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by op erating activities in a period minus payments for p roperty and equipment made in that 
period. We generated free cash flow of $16.4 billio n , $10.1 billion and $12.7 billion for fiscal 2015  , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The 
increase in free cash flow for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was pr imarily due to the timing of payments for accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities, as well as the tim ing of income tax payments, combined with lower cap ital expenditures. The fiscal 2014 
decline in free cash flow, when compared to the pre vious fiscal year, was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments, as well as lower 
income from continuing operations and slightly high er capital expenditures.  
Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited i n that it does not represent residual cash flows av ailable for discretionary expenditures due to 
the fact that the measure does not deduct the payme nts required for debt service and other contractual  obligations or payments made for 
business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
Although other companies report their free cash flo w, numerous methods may exist for calculating a com pany's free cash flow. As a result, the 
method used by Walmart's management to calculate ou r free cash flow may differ from the methods used b y other companies to calculate their 
free cash flow. We urge you to understand the metho ds used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free 
cash flow to that of such other companies.  
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to ne t cash provided by operating activities, 
which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure m ost directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used 
in investing activities and net cash used in financ ing activities.  
(1) "Net cash used in investing activities" include s payments for property and equipment, which is als o included in our computation of free cash flow.

Results of Operations  
Consolidated Results of Operations  
Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of n et sales, but also include membership and other inc ome, increased 2.0% and 1.6% for 
fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in total revenues was consistent with the 1.9% and 
1.6% increases in net sales. The increase in net sa les was primarily due to 3.0% year-over- year growth in retail square feet, positive compara ble 
sales in the U.S. and higher e-commerce sales acros s the Company. The increase was partially offset by  $5.3 billion of negative impact from 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal 2015 . The increase in net sales for fiscal 2014 wa s due to 3.1% growth in retail square feet, 
higher e-commerce sales, the impact of fiscal 2013 acquisitions and positive comparable club sales at Sam's Club. The increase in net sales for 
fiscal 2014 was partially offset by $5.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency ex change rates. An increase in membership and 
other income in both fiscal years, primarily due to  growth in membership income at Sam's Club, also co ntributed to the increase in total 
revenues.  
Our gross profit rate was relatively flat for fisca l 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  While the gross profit rate at Walmart 
International increased, the gross profit rate at W almart U.S. and Sam's Club decreased. Our gross pro fit rate decreased 3 basis points for fiscal 
2014, when compared to the previous fiscal year, pr imarily due to our ongoing investment in price, as well as merchandise mix.  
For fiscal 2015 , we did not meet our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than ne t sales as operating expenses as a 
percentage of net sales increased 6 basis points wh en compared to the same period in the previous fisc al year. Our continued investments in 
digital retail, higher health-care expenses in the U.S. from increased enrollment and medical cost inf lation, the $249 million impact of wage 
and hour litigation in the U.S., as well as expense s of $148 million related to the closure of approxi mately 30 underperforming stores in Japan 
were the primary factors that caused us not to leve rage for fiscal 2015 . For fiscal 2014, we did not meet our objective of growing operating 
expenses at a slower rate than net sales as operati ng expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 27 basis points. Overall, lower than 
anticipated net sales, higher investment in key are as, such as global leverage and e-commerce initiati ves, and nearly $1.0 billion of increased 
expenses for various matters described in the Walma rt International segment discussion, were the prima ry cause for the increase in operating 
expenses as a percentage of net sales.  
For fiscal 2015 , we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at the same rate or a fast er rate than net sales as operating income 
increased 1.0% while net sales increased 1.9% when compared to the previous fiscal year. This was prim arily due to the factors we discussed 
for not leveraging operating expenses. For fiscal 2 014, we also did not meet our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net 
sales as operating income decreased 3.1% while net sales increased 1.6%, when compared to the previous  fiscal year. This was primarily due to 
the factors we discussed for not leveraging operati ng expenses, partially offset by increases in membe rship and other income.  
Our effective income tax rates were 32.2% , 32.9% a nd 31.0%, for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respect ively. The reconciliation from the U.S. 
statutory rate to the effective income tax rates fo r fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is presented in Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements."  
As a result of the factors discussed above, we repo rted $16.8 billion , $16.6 billion and $17.7 billio n of consolidated income from continuing 
operations for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respec tively, an increase of $263.0 million for fiscal 20 15 and a decrease of $1.1 billion for fiscal 
2014 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Dil uted income from continuing operations per common s hare attributable to Walmart 
("EPS") was $4.99 , $4.85 and $5.01 for fiscal 2015  , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

Walmart U.S. Segment  
Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased 3.1% and 1.8% for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respective ly, when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. For fiscal 2015, the increase in net sales wa s due to year -over-year growth in retail square feet of 3.2% , a s well as an increase in 
comparable store sales of 0.6% . Positive traffic and lower gas prices late in the  fiscal year contributed to the increase in compara ble store sales. 
For fiscal 2014 , the increase in net sales was due  to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.9%, partially offset by a decline in 
comparable store sales of 0.6% . Fiscal 2014 compar able store sales were negatively impacted by lower consumer spending primarily due to 
the slow recovery in general economic conditions, t he 2% increase in the 2013 payroll tax rate and the  reduction in government food benefits.  
The fiscal 2015 gross profit rate decreased 12 basi s points compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in the gross profit rate was 
primarily the result of the segment's strategic foc us on price investment, pharmacy cost inflation, re ductions in third-party reimbursement rates 
and changes in merchandise mix. The fiscal year 201 4 gross profit rate was relatively flat when compar ed to the previous fiscal year primarily 
due to price investment and low price leadership, p artially offset by cost of goods savings initiative s and supply chain productivity.  
Walmart U.S. did not leverage operating expenses fo r fiscal 2015 , as operating expenses as a percenta ge of segment net sales increased 24 
basis points. The increase in operating expenses as  a percentage of segment net sales was primarily dr iven by higher health-care expenses from 
increased enrollment and medical cost inflation. In  addition, expenses from severe winter storms early  in the year contributed to the increase in 
operating expenses as a percentage of segment net s ales. Walmart U.S. leveraged operating expenses for  fiscal 2014 , driven by productivity 
initiatives as well as lower incentive expenses in fiscal 2014 .  
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment  operating income was $21.3 billion , $21.8 billion  and $21.1 billion during fiscal 2015 , 
2014 and 2013, respectively. Walmart U.S. did not g row operating income faster than sales during fisca l 2015 , but grew operating income 
faster than sales during fiscal 2014 .

Walmart International Segment  
Net sales for the Walmart International segment dec reased 0.3% and increased 1.3% for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively, when compared to 
the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2015 , the dec rease in net sales was due to $5.3 billion of negat ive impact from fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates, partially offset by year-over-year net growth in retail square feet of 2.6% and higher  e-commerce sales in each country with e-
commerce operations, particularly in the United Kin gdom, China and Brazil. For fiscal 2014 , the incre ase in net sales was due to year-over-
year net growth in retail square feet of 3.6% and t he impact of fiscal 2013 acquisitions, which accoun ted for $730 million of the net sales 
increase. In addition, higher e-commerce sales in e ach country with e-commerce operations contributed to the increase. The increase in net 
sales was partially offset by $5.1 billion of negat ive impact from fluctuations in currency exchange r ates.  
Gross profit rate increased 12 basis points for fis cal 2015 and decreased 10 basis points for fiscal 2 014 , when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. The fiscal 2015 increase in gross profit rate was primarily du e to changes in the merchandise mix in a number of the segment's larger 
operations. The fiscal 2014 decrease in gross profi t rate was primarily due to price investments in ce rtain countries, including Brazil, Canada 
and Mexico.  
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales dec reased 51 basis points for fiscal 2015 , when compa red to the previous fiscal year. The 
decrease was due to the nearly $1.0 billion of aggr egated expenses incurred in fiscal 2014 detailed be low, which were partially offset by fiscal 
2015 expenses of $148 million related to the closur e of approximately 30 underperforming stores in Jap an.  
For fiscal 2014 , operating expenses as a percentag e of net sales increased 80 basis points, when comp ared to the previous fiscal year. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales wer e primarily impacted by the nearly $1.0 billion of aggregated expenses for the following 
matters:  
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment  operating income was $6.2 billion , $5.2 billion a nd $6.4 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 
2013 , respectively. Fluctuations in currency excha nge rates negatively impacted operating income $225  million , $26 million and $111 million 
in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 respectively. Althou gh currency fluctuations caused net sales for Walma rt International to decline, operating 
income grew for fiscal 2015 . Operating income did not grow faster than net sales in fiscal 2014 .

Sam's Club Segment  
We believe the information in the following table u nder the caption "Excluding Fuel" is useful to inve stors because it permits investors to 
understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's f uel sales on its results of operations, which are i mpacted by the volatility of fuel prices. 
Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact th e operating results of the Sam's Club segment in th e future.   
Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased 1.5% and 1.3% for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respective ly, when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. The fiscal 2015 increase in net sales was primarily due to yea r-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.5% , driven by the addition of 
15 new clubs, partially offset by a decrease in fue l sales due to the lower average selling price. Com parable club sales were flat for fiscal 2015 . 
The fiscal 2014 increase in net sales was due to ye ar-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.1%, driven by the addition of 12 new clubs, as 
well as positive comparable club sales of 0.3%. The  fiscal 2014 positive comparable club sales were th e result of increased member traffic 
primarily coming from our Savings Members, partiall y offset by severe winter storms that occurred in t he fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 .  
Gross profit rate decreased 12 basis points for fis cal 2015 and was flat for fiscal 2014 , when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 
2015 , the gross profit rate decreased primarily du e to the segment's investment in the Cash Rewards p rogram, changes in merchandise mix, 
and commodity cost inflation, partially offset by a n increased gross profit rate on fuel sales. For fi scal 2014, our gross profit was negatively 
impacted by an increase to our product warranty lia bilities, which was offset by a favorable impact fr om merchandise mix.  
Membership and other income increased 7.7% and 14.1 % for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, when comp ared to the previous fiscal year. 
For fiscal 2015 , the increase was primarily the re sult of increased membership upgrades, Plus Member renewals and an increase in members 
from the opening of 15 new clubs. For fiscal 2014 ,  the increase was primarily due to improved contrac t terms relating to the profit sharing 
arrangement with our credit card provider, increase d membership fees that were introduced on May 15, 2 013, $24 million of income from the 
sale of two real estate properties and an increase in members from the opening of 12 new clubs.  
Sam's Club leveraged operating expenses for fiscal 2015 , as operating expenses as a percentage of seg ment net sales decreased 16 basis points 
compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment ne t sales for fiscal 2015 was primarily due 
to better expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the new in-club staff ing structure announced in fiscal 2014 , 
which resulted in decreases in wage expense and pay roll taxes. This was partially offset by higher hea lth-care expenses, mostly from increased 
enrollment and medical cost inflation. For fiscal 2 014 , Sam's Club did not leverage expenses, as operatin g expenses as a percentage of segment 
net sales increased 26 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in operat ing expenses as a percentage of segment 
net sales was primarily due to a $59 million charge  for the implementation of the new in-club staffing  structure and the pending closure of one 
club, as well as a state excise tax refund credit w e received in the previous fiscal year.  
As a result of the factors discussed above, operati ng income was $2.0 billion , $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. Sam's Club did grow operating income faster than net sales in fiscal 2015 , but did not grow operating income faster than sales in 
fiscal 2014 .

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
Liquidity  
The strength and stability of our operations have h istorically supplied us with a significant source o f liquidity. Our cash flows provided by 
operating activities, supplemented with our long-te rm debt and short-term borrowings, have been suffic ient to fund our operations while 
allowing us to invest in activities that support th e long-term growth of our operations. Generally, so me or all of the remaining available cash 
flow has been used to fund the dividends on our com mon stock and share repurchases. We believe our sou rces of liquidity will continue to be 
adequate to fund operations, finance our global exp ansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share  repurchases for the foreseeable future.  
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $28.6 billion , $23.3 billion and $25.6 billion for  fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The 
increase in net cash provided by operating activiti es for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was pr imarily due to the timing 
of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabil ities, as well as the timing of income tax payments . The decrease in cash flows provided by 
operating activities in fiscal 2014 , when compared  to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments, as well 
as lower income from continuing operations.  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Compan y announced a new associate wage structure combined  with comprehensive associate 
training and educational programs. We anticipate ca sh flows provided by operating activities will be s ufficient to fund these programs.  
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital  
Cash and cash equivalents were $9.1 billion and $7. 3 billion for fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $2.0 
billion and $8.2 billion at January 31, 2015 and 20 14 , respectively. The decrease in our working capi tal deficit is primarily the result of using 
less of our net cash provided by operating activiti es for share repurchases and capital expenditures d uring fiscal 2015 , which allowed us to 
reduce our short-term borrowings. We generally oper ate with a working capital deficit due to our effic ient use of cash in funding operations, 
consistent access to the capital markets and in pro viding returns to our shareholders in the form of p ayments of cash dividends and share 
repurchases.  
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an ef fort to ensure cash can be made available in the co untry in which it is needed with the 
minimum cost possible. We do not believe it will be  necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. and anticipate 
our domestic liquidity needs will be met through ca sh flows provided by operating activities, suppleme nted with long-term debt and short-term 
borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certa in exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest  our cash and cash equivalents held 
outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. When  the income earned, either from operations or throu gh intercompany financing arrangements, 
and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are general ly lower than the U.S. statutory rate, we 
realize an effective tax rate benefit. If our inten tions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign 
operations could be repatriated to the U.S., althou gh any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws wou ld be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, 
less applicable foreign tax credits. As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , cash and cash equivalents of ap proximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion , 
respectively, may not be freely transferable to the  U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. We d o not expect local laws, other limitations or 
potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations  of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a  material effect on our overall liquidity, 
financial condition or results of operations.  
 
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  
Net cash used in investing activities was $11.1 billion , $12.5 billion and $12.6 billion for  fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and 
generally consisted of payments to add stores, remo del numerous existing stores, expand our digital re tail capabilities and invest in other 
technologies. Net cash used in investing activities  decreased $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015 , when comp ared to the previous fiscal year, primarily 
due to lower capital expenditures. The following ta ble provides additional capital expenditure detail:

We continue to focus on striving to seamlessly inte grate the digital and physical shopping experience for our customers and expanded in digital 
retail in each of our segments during fiscal 2015 ,  with Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club focused on digita l retail in the U.S. and Walmart 
International focused on digital retail in countrie s outside of the U.S. Some of our fiscal 2015 accomplishments in this area were to successfully 
launch our new web platform in the U.S., grow mobil e and increase our third-party marketplace offering .  
Growth Activities  
In fiscal 2016 , we plan to add between 26 and 30 million square f eet, which will include a continued investment in N eighborhood Markets and 
a moderation of Supercenter growth in the U.S. comp ared to recent fiscal years. In addition, we plan t o accelerate the growth of our digital 
retail capabilities by investing $1.2 billion to $1 .5 billion in e-commerce websites and mobile commer ce applications that will include 
technology, infrastructure and other areas to bette r serve our customers and support our stores and cl ubs. We anticipate financing these growth 
activities through cash flows provided by operating  activities and future debt financings.  
The following table provides our estimated range fo r fiscal 2016 capital expenditures, as well as our estimated range for growth in retail square 
feet. Our anticipated digital retail expenditures a re included in our estimated range for fiscal 2016 capital expenditures. The amounts in the 
table do not include capital expenditures or growth  in retail square feet from any pending or future a cquisitions.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities  
Cash flows used in financing activities generally c onsist of transactions related to our short-term an d long-term debt, as well as dividends paid 
and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions w ith noncontrolling interest shareholders are also c lassified as cash flows from financing 
activities.  
Short-term Borrowings  
Short-term borrowings decreased $6.3 billion for fi scal 2015 and increased $0.9 billion for fiscal 201 4 , when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided b y short -term borrowings to provide funding used for our ope rations, dividend payments, share 
repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash re quirements. However, more cash provided from operat ing activities combined with less cash 
used for share repurchases and capital expenditures  during fiscal 2015 , allowed us to minimize our sh ort-term borrowings at January 31, 2015 . 
In addition to our short-term borrowings, we also h ave various undrawn committed lines of credit that provide $15.0 billion of additional 
liquidity, if needed.  
Long -term Debt  
The following table provides the changes in our lon g-term debt for fiscal 2015 : 
Our total outstanding long-term debt balance was re latively flat as of January 31, 2015 compared to th e balance as of January 31, 2014. During 
fiscal 2015 , we used the proceeds from the issuanc e of long-term debt to pay down and refinance exist ing debt and for other corporate 
purposes.  
Dividends  
Our total dividend payments were $6.2 billion , $6. 1 billion and $5.4 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 a nd 2013 , respectively, and on February 19, 
2015 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2 016 annual dividend of $ 1.96 per share, an increas e compared to the fiscal 2015 annual 
dividend of $1.92 per share. For fiscal 2016 , the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly inst allments of $0.49 per share, according to the 
following record and payable dates:  
Company Share Repurchase Program  
From time to time, we repurchase shares of our comm on stock under share repurchase programs authorized  by the Board of Directors. The 
current $15.0 billion share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting t he period over which we can make share 
repurchases. At January 31, 2015 , authorization fo r $10.3 billion of share repurchases remained under  the current share repurchase program. 
Any repurchased shares are constructively retired a nd returned to an unissued status.

We regularly review share repurchase activity and c onsider several factors in determining when to exec ute share repurchases, including, among 
other things, current cash needs, capacity for leve rage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations  and the market price of our common stock. 
The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average pr ice paid per share and total cash paid for 
share repurchases for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 :   
 
We decreased the total cash paid for share repurcha ses by $5.7 billion for fiscal 2015 , compared to t he previous fiscal year, as a result of 
current cash needs, capacity for leverage and incre ased cash used in transactions with noncontrolling interests described further below. In 
addition, our results of operations influenced our share repurchase activity.  
 
Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests  
As described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financi al Statements, during fiscal 2015 , we completed th e purchase of substantially all of the 
remaining noncontrolling interest in Walmart Chile for approximately $1.5 billion, using existing cash  to complete this transaction.  
 
Capital Resources  
We believe cash flows from continuing operations, o ur current cash position and access to capital mark ets will continue to be sufficient to meet 
our anticipated operating cash needs, including to fund seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories, and to fund our capital expenditures, 
dividend payments and share repurchases.  
We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to en able us to refinance our debt as it 
becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. At January 31, 2015 , the ratings assigned to our c ommercial paper and rated series of our 
outstanding long-term debt were as follows:  
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodi cally and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned t o us by each agency may be subject to 
revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that 
could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic env ironment, conditions in the retail 
industry, our financial position, including our tot al debt and capitalization, and changes in our busi ness strategy. Any downgrade of our credit 
ratings by a credit rating agency could increase ou r future borrowing costs or impair our ability to a ccess capital and credit markets on terms 
commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any dow ngrade of our current short-term credit ratings cou ld impair our ability to access the 
commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more 
expensive types of debt financing. The credit ratin g agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, se ll or hold our commercial paper or debt 
securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating o rganization and should be evaluated 
independently of any other rating. Moreover, each c redit rating is specific to the security to which i t applies.  
We monitor our credit rating and our capacity for l ong-term financing using various qualitative and qu antitative factors, including our debt-to-
total capitalization, as support for our long-term financing decisions.  For the purpose of the debt-t o-total capitalization calculation, debt is 
defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-t erm debt due within one year, obligations under cap ital leases due within one year, long-
term debt and long-term obligations under capital l eases. Total capitalization is defined as debt plus  total Walmart shareholders' equity. At 
January 31, 2015 and 2014 , the ratio of our debt-t o-total capitalization was 38.2% and 42.6% , respec tively. The decrease in our debt-to-total 
capitalization ratio was the result of using less c ash for share repurchases and capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 , which allowed us to 
minimize our short-term borrowings at January 31, 2 015 . The reduced share repurchases also resulted in in creased growth in retained earnings. 
These impacts were partially offset by additional c urrency translation losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commit ments  
 
The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments, such as 
debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent c ommitments:  
 
Additionally, the Company has $15.0 billion in undr awn committed lines of credit which, if drawn upon,  would be included in the current 
liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated B alance Sheets.  
Estimated interest payments are based on our princi pal amounts and expected maturities of all debt out standing at January 31, 2015 , and 
management's forecasted market rates for our variab le rate debt.  
Purchase obligations include legally binding contra cts, such as firm commitments for inventory and uti lity purchases, as well as commitments 
to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service  contracts. Purchase orders for 
inventory and other services are not included in th e table above. Purchase orders represent authorizat ions to purchase rather than binding 
agreements. For the purposes of this table, contrac tual obligations for the purchase of goods or servi ces are defined as agreements that are 
enforceable and legally binding and that specify al l significant terms, including: fixed or minimum qu antities to be purchased; fixed, minimum 
or variable price provisions; and the approximate t iming of the transaction. Our purchase orders are b ased on our current inventory needs and 
are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time pe riods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under 
these contracts are not significant and the contrac ts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellat ion without significant penalty.  
The expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current infor mation. Timing of payments and actual 
amounts paid with respect to some unrecorded contra ctual commitments may be different depending on the  timing of receipt of goods or 
services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some  obligations.  
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above , $838 million of unrecognized tax benefits are con sidered uncertain tax positions and have 
been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the pay ment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 in the "Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional d iscussion of unrecognized tax benefits.  
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  
In addition to the unrecorded contractual obligatio ns presented above, we have entered into certain ar rangements, as discussed below, for which 
the timing of payment, if any, is unknown.  
The Company has future lease commitments for land a nd buildings for approximately 282 future locations . These lease commitments have 
lease terms ranging from 1 to 30 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If executed, payments under operating leases would increase 
by $58 million for fiscal 2016 , based on current e stimates.  
In connection with certain long-term debt issuances , we could be liable for early termination payments  if certain unlikely events were to occur. 
At January 31, 2015 , the aggregate termination pay ment would have been $64 million . The arrangement pursuant to which this payment co uld 
be made will expire in fiscal 2019 .

Market Risk  
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations , we are exposed to certain market risks, including  changes in interest rates and fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates.  
The analysis presented below for each of our market  risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypotheti cal scenario used to calibrate potential 
risk and does not represent our view of future mark et changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting 
any other assumption. In reality, however, a change  in one factor could cause a change in another, whi ch may magnify or negate other 
sensitivities.  
Interest Rate Risk  
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a re sult of our short-term borrowings and long-term deb t issuances. We hedge a portion of our 
interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and  variable rate debt and by entering into interest r ate swaps. For fiscal 2015 , the net fair value 
of our interest rate swaps decreased approximately  $158 million primarily due to fluctuations in mark et interest rates and the termination of 
forward starting receive variable-rate, pay fixed-r ate swaps in October and April 2014 concurrently wi th the issuance of debt.  
The table below provides information about our fina ncial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the 
table represents the principal cash flows and relat ed weighted-average interest rates by expected matu rity dates. For interest rate swaps, the 
table represents the contractual cash flows and wei ghted-average interest rates by the contractual mat urity date, unless otherwise noted. The 
notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The  weighted-average variable rates are 
based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2 015 .  
As of January 31, 2015 , our variable rate borrowin gs, including the effect of our commercial paper an d interest rate swaps, represented 7% of 
our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on J anuary 31, 2015 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would  cause 
our annual interest costs to change by approximatel y $23 million .

Foreign Currency Risk  
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments a nd operations in countries other than the 
U.S. For fiscal 2015 , movements in currency exchan ge rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's 
subsidiaries in Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico and Chile were the primary cause of the  $3. 6 billion net loss in the currency 
translation and other category of accumulated other  comprehensive income (loss). We hedge a portion of  our foreign currency risk by entering 
into currency swaps and designating certain foreign -currency-denominated long-term debt as net investm ent hedges.  
We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchan ge component of our net investments and also to hed ge the currency exchange rate 
fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted  payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. den ominated debt. The aggregate fair value 
of these swaps was in a liability position of $110 million at January 31, 2015 and in an asset positio n of $550 million at January 31, 2014 . The 
change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar 
relative to other currencies in the latter half of fiscal 2015 . A hypothetical 10% increase or decrea se in the currency exchange rates underlying 
these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 201 5 would have resulted in a loss or gain in the valu e of the swaps of $435 million . A 
hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlyin g these swaps from the market rates in effect at Ja nuary 31, 2015 would have resulted in a 
loss or gain in value of the swaps of $20 million .   
In addition to currency swaps, we have designated f oreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonde rivative hedges of net investments of 
certain of our foreign operations. At January 31, 2 015 and 2014 , we had £2.5 billion of outstanding l ong-term debt designated as a hedge of 
our net investment in the United Kingdom. At Januar y 31, 2015 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decreas e in the value of the U.S. dollar 
relative to the British pound would have resulted i n a gain or loss in the value of the debt of $342 m illion . In addition, we had outstanding 
long-term debt of ¥100 billion at January 31, 2015 and ¥200 billion at January 31, 2014 , that was des ignated as a hedge of our net investment 
in Japan. At January 31, 2015 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar re lative to the Japanese yen would have 
resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt  of $77 million .  
Other Matters  
We discuss our existing FCPA investigation and rela ted matters in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for f iscal 2015 , including certain risks 
arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 1 0-K under the caption "Risk Factors" and in Note 10  to our Consolidated Financial 
Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," und er the sub-caption "FCPA Investigation and Related Matters." We also discuss various

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates  
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in s ome cases accounting and disclosure 
rules are complex and require us to use technical t erminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated  Financial Statements, we follow 
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S . These principles require us to make certain estim ates and apply judgments that affect our 
financial position and results of operations as ref lected in our financial statements. These judgments  and estimates are based on past events and 
expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may  differ from our estimates.  
Management continually reviews our accounting polic ies, how they are applied and how they are reported  and disclosed in our financial 
statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in pr eparation of the financial statements.  
Inventories  
We value inventories at the lower of cost or market  as determined primarily by the retail method of ac counting, using the last-in, first-out 
("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmar t U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued 
primarily by the retail inventory method of account ing, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.  The retail method of accounting results in 
inventory being valued at the lower of cost or mark et since permanent markdowns are immediately record ed as a reduction of the retail value of 
inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued based on the weighted-average cost using the LIFO method.  
Under the retail method of accounting, inventory is  valued at the lower of cost or market, which is de termined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio 
to each merchandise grouping's retail value. The FI FO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the f iscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-
retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is ba sed on the initial margin of the fiscal year purcha se activity less the impact of any permanent 
markdowns. The retail method of accounting requires  management to make certain judgments and estimates  that may significantly impact the 
ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized. Judgments made i nclude recording markdowns used to sell 
inventory and shrinkage. When management determines  the ability to sell inventory has diminished, mark downs for clearance activity and the 
related cost impact are recorded. Factors considere d in the determination of markdowns include current  and anticipated demand, customer 
preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seas onal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and cus tomer preferences could cause material 
changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.  
When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these est imates are adjusted to actual results 
determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calcu lated based on inventory levels, markup rates and i nternally generated retail price indices. 
At January 31, 2015 and 2014 , our inventories valu ed at LIFO approximated those inventories as if the y were valued at FIFO.  
We provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrin kage, between physical inventory counts on the basi s of a percentage of sales. Following 
annual inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results.  
Impairment of Assets  
We evaluate long-lived assets other than goodwill a nd assets with indefinite lives for indicators of i mpairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may n ot be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding  the existence of impairment 
indicators are based on market conditions and opera tional performance, such as operating income and ca sh flows. The evaluation for long- lived 
assets is performed at the lowest level of identifi able cash flows, which is generally at the individu al store level or, in certain markets, at the 
market group level. The variability of these factor s depends on a number of conditions, including unce rtainty about future events and changes 
in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may  change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that 
indicators of impairment exist and require impairme nt tests be performed, which could result in manage ment determining the value of long-
lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down  of the related long-lived assets.  
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intang ible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated fo r impairment annually or whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the value  of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, thi s evaluation begins with a qualitative 
assessment to determine whether a quantitative impa irment test is necessary. If we determine, after pe rforming an assessment based on the 
qualitative factors, that the fair value of the rep orting unit is more likely than not less than the c arrying amount, or that a fair value of the 
reporting unit substantially in excess of the carry ing amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative i mpairment test would be performed. The 
quantitative test for impairment requires managemen t to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market 
conditions. These evaluations are based on determin ing the fair value of a reporting unit or asset usi ng a valuation method such as discounted 
cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. His torically, our reporting units have generated suffi cient returns to recover the cost of 
goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intang ible assets. Because of the nature of the factors u sed in these tests, if different conditions 
occur in future periods, future operating results c ould be materially impacted.

As of January 31, 2015, the fair value of certain r ecently acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets  approximated their carrying value of $419 
million. Any deterioration in the fair value of the se assets would result in a related impairment char ge.  Management will continue to monitor 
the fair value of these assets in future periods.  
Income Taxes  
Income taxes have a significant effect on our net e arnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.  and numerous foreign jurisdictions. 
Accordingly, the determination of our provision for  income taxes requires significant judgment, the us e of estimates and the interpretation and 
application of complex tax laws. Our effective inco me tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax 
contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation  allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of admini strative audits, the impact of discrete 
items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and in ternational operations where the statutory rates ar e generally lower than the U.S. statutory 
rate, and may fluctuate as a result.  
Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlemen ts of issues raised in these audits sometimes affec t our tax provisions. The benefits of 
uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financi al statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax 
positions will withstand challenge, if any, from ta xing authorities. When facts and circumstances chan ge, we reassess these probabilities and 
record any changes in the financial statements as a ppropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition 
threshold that a tax position is required to meet b efore being recognized in the financial statements.  This determination requires the use of 
significant judgment in evaluating our tax position s and assessing the timing and amounts of deductibl e and taxable items.  
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in fu ture years. Such assets arise because of 
temporary differences between the financial reporti ng and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well  as from net operating loss and tax credit 
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated fo r future realization and reduced by a valuation all owance to the extent that a portion is not 
more likely than not to be realized. Many factors a re considered when assessing whether it is more lik ely than not that the deferred tax assets 
will be realized, including recent cumulative earni ngs, expectations of future taxable income, carryfo rward periods and other relevant 
quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverab ility of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by as sessing the adequacy of future expected 
taxable income from all sources, including reversal  of taxable temporary differences, forecasted opera ting earnings and available tax planning 
strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estim ates.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
General  
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live b etter – anytime and anywhere – in 
retail stores or through the Company's e-commerce a nd mobile capabilities. Through innovation, the Com pany is striving to create a customer-
centric experience that seamlessly integrates digit al and physical shopping. Each week, the Company se rves nearly 260 million customers who 
visit its over 11,000 stores under 72 banners in 27  countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries.  The Company's strategy is to lead on 
price, invest to differentiate on access, be compet itive on assortment and deliver a great experience.   
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and S am's Club.  
Principles of Consolidation  
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the a ccounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and f or the fiscal years ended January 31, 
2015 ("fiscal 2015 "), January 31, 2014 ("fiscal 20 14 ") and January 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013 "). All ma terial intercompany accounts and 
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which ar e 50% or less owned and do not otherwise 
meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the equity method. These investment s are immaterial to the Company's 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are  based on a fiscal year ending on January 31, for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian 
operations. The Company consolidates all other oper ations generally using a one-month lag and based on  a calendar year. There were no 
significant intervening events during January 2015 that materially affected the Consolidated Financial  Statements.  
Use of Estimates  
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been pre pared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted ac counting principles. Those principles 
require management to make estimates and assumption s that affect the reported amounts of assets and li abilities. Management's estimates and 
assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingen t assets and liabilities at the date of the financi al statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
The Company considers investments with a maturity w hen purchased of three months or less to be cash eq uivalents. All credit card, debit card 
and electronic benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as c ash and cash equivalents. The amounts due 
from banks for these transactions classified as cas h and cash equivalents totaled $2.9 billion and $1. 6 billion at January 31, 2015 and 2014 , 
respectively. In addition, cash and cash equivalent s included restricted cash of $345 million and $654  million at January 31, 2015 and 2014 , 
respectively, which was primarily related to cash c ollateral holdings from various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust 
agreements.  
The Company's cash balances are held in various loc ations around the world. Of the Company's $9.1 bill ion and $7.3 billion of cash and cash 
equivalents at January 31, 2015 and 2014 , respecti vely, $6.3 billion and $5.8 billion , respectively,  were held outside of the U.S. and were 
generally utilized to support liquidity needs in th e Company's non-U.S. operations.  
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangement s in an effort to ensure cash can be made available  in the country in which it is needed 
with the minimum cost possible. Management does not  believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash an d cash equivalents held outside of the 
U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidi ty needs will be met through cash flows provided by  operating activities, supplemented 
with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Acco rdingly, the Company intends, with only certain exc eptions, to continue to indefinitely 
reinvest the Company's cash and cash equivalents he ld outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. W hen the income earned, either from 
operations or through intercompany financing arrang ements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, 
which are generally lower than the U.S. statutory r ate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate ben efit. If the Company's intentions with 
respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the  amounts held within the Company's foreign operatio ns could be repatriated to the U.S., 
although any repatriation under current U.S. tax la ws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, l ess applicable foreign tax credits. As of 
January 31, 2015 and 2014 , cash and cash equivalen ts of approximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion ,  respectively, may not be freely 
transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other  restrictions. The Company does not expect local la ws, other limitations or potential taxes on 
anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts he ld outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on  the Company's overall liquidity, financial 
condition or results of operations.

Receivables  
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, ne t of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables c onsist primarily of amounts due from:  
The Walmart International segment offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily throu gh its financial institutions in select 
markets. The receivable balance from consumer credi t products was $ 1.2 billion , net of a reserve for  doubtful accounts of $114 million at 
January 31, 2015 , compared to a receivable balance  of $ 1.3 billion , net of a reserve for doubtful a ccounts of $ 119 million at January 31, 
2014 . These balances are included in receivables, net, in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
Inventories  
The Company values inventories at the lower of cost  or market as determined primarily by the retail in ventory method of accounting, using the 
last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for substantiall y all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. Th e inventory at the Walmart International 
segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory  method of accounting, using the first-in, first-ou t ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory 
method of accounting results in inventory being val ued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as 
a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The i nventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued based on the weighted-average cost using the 
LIFO method. At January 31, 2015 and January 31, 20 14 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO appro ximated those inventories as if they 
were valued at FIFO.  
Property and Equipment  
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Gains or  losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are 
capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and main tenance are charged to expense as incurred. The fol lowing table summarizes the Company's 
property and equipment balances and includes the es timated useful lives that are generally used to dep reciate the assets on a straight-line basis:  
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the sho rter of the estimated useful life of the asset or t he remaining expected lease term. 
Depreciation expense for property and equipment, in cluding amortization of property under capital leas es, for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was 
$9.1 billion , $8.8 billion and $8.4 billion , resp ectively. Interest costs capitalized on constructio n projects were $59 million , $78 million and 
$74 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respec tively.  
Long -Lived Assets  
Long-lived assets are stated at cost. Management re views long-lived assets for indicators of impairmen t whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may  not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at  the lowest level of identifiable cash 
flows, which is at the individual store or club lev el or, in certain circumstances, a market group of stores. Undiscounted cash flows expected to 
be generated by the related assets are estimated ov er the assets' useful lives based on updated projec tions. If the evaluation indicates that the 
carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverabl e, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or 
asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Impairment charges of long-lived assets for fiscal 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 were not significant.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase pric e over the fair value of net assets acquired in bus iness combinations and is allocated to the 
appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acq uired intangible assets are stated at the fair valu e acquired as determined by a valuation 
technique commensurate with the intended use of the  related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intan gible assets are not amortized; rather, 
they are evaluated for impairment annually and when ever events or changes in circumstances indicate th at the value of the asset may be 
impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are cons idered long-lived assets and are amortized on a str aight-line basis over the periods that 
expected economic benefits will be provided.  
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a  qualitative or quantitative approach for each of t he Company's reporting units. Generally, a 
qualitative assessment is first performed to determ ine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test  is necessary. If management determines, 
after performing an assessment based on the qualita tive factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the 
carrying amount, or that a fair value of the report ing unit substantially in excess of the carrying am ount cannot be assured, then a quantitative 
goodwill impairment test would be required. The qua ntitative test for goodwill impairment is performed  by determining the fair value of the 
related reporting units. Fair value is measured bas ed on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches.  
The Company's reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test. Management determin ed the fair value of each reporting 
unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accor dingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment  charges related to goodwill.  
The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2015 and 2014 :  
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets 
are evaluated for impairment based on their fair va lues using valuation techniques which are updated a nnually based on the most recent 
variables and assumptions. There were no impairment  charges related to indefinite-lived intangible ass ets recorded for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 
2013 .  
Self Insurance Reserves  
The Company uses a combination of insurance and sel f insurance for a number of risks, including, but n ot limited to, workers' compensation, 
general liability, auto liability, product liabilit y and the Company's obligation for employee-related  health care benefits. Liabilities relating to 
the claims associated with these risks are estimate d by considering historical claims experience, freq uency, severity, demographic factors and 
other actuarial assumptions, including incurred but  not reported claims. In estimating its liability f or such claims, the Company periodically 
analyzes its historical trends, including loss deve lopment, and applies appropriate loss development f actors to the incurred costs associated with 
the claims. To limit exposure to certain risks, the  Company maintains stop-loss insurance coverage for  workers' compensation of $5 million per 
occurrence, and in most instances, $15 million per occurrence for general liability.

Income Taxes  
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sh eet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are  recognized for the estimated future tax 
consequences attributable to differences between th e financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective 
tax bases ("temporary differences"). Deferred tax a ssets and liabilities are measured using enacted ta x rates in effect for the year in which those 
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and l iabilities of a change in tax rate is 
recognized in income in the period that includes th e enactment date.  
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realiz ation and reduced by a valuation allowance to the e xtent that a portion is not more likely than 
not to be realized. Many factors are considered whe n assessing whether it is more likely than not that  the deferred tax assets will be realized, 
including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and  other relevant quantitative and 
qualitative factors. The recoverability of the defe rred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequ acy of future expected taxable income from 
all sources, including reversal of taxable temporar y differences, forecasted operating earnings and av ailable tax planning strategies. These 
sources of income rely heavily on estimates.  
In determining the provision for income taxes, an a nnual effective income tax rate is used based on an nual income, permanent differences 
between book and tax income, and statutory income t ax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements  or changes in tax laws are recognized in 
the period in which they occur.  
The Company records a liability for unrecognized ta x benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions t aken or expected to be taken in a tax 
return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest ex pense and operating, selling, general and 
administrative expenses, respectively, in the Compa ny's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to No te 9 for additional income tax 
disclosures.  
Revenue Recognition       
Sales  
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it s ells merchandise to the customer.  
Membership Fee Revenue  
The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of th e membership, which is typically 12 
months. The following table summarizes membership f ee activity for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 :  
Membership fee revenue is included in membership an d other income in the Company's Consolidated Statem ents of Income. The deferred 
membership fee is included in accrued liabilities i n the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
Shopping Cards  
Customer purchases of shopping cards are not recogn ized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using 
the shopping card. Shopping cards in the U.S. do no t carry an expiration date; therefore, customers an d members can redeem their shopping 
cards for merchandise indefinitely. Shopping cards in certain foreign countries where the Company does  business may have expiration dates. A 
certain number of shopping cards, both with and wit hout expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed 
shopping cards and recognizes revenue for these amo unts over shopping card historical usage periods ba sed on historical redemption rates. 
Management periodically reviews and updates its est imates of usage periods and redemption rates.

Cost of Sales  
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cos t of transportation to the Company's distribution f acilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the 
cost of transportation from the Company's distribut ion facilities to the stores, clubs and customers a nd the cost of warehousing for the Sam's 
Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are n ot a reimbursement of specific, 
incremental and identifiable costs.  
Payments from Suppliers  
The Company receives consideration from suppliers f or various programs, primarily volume incentives, w arehouse allowances and 
reimbursements for specific programs such as markdo wns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-sp ecific fixtures. Payments from 
suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized in the Company's Consol idated Statements of Income when the 
related inventory is sold, except when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and ide ntifiable costs.  
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expe nses  
Operating, selling, general and administrative expe nses include all operating costs of the Company, ex cept cost of sales, as described above. As 
a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing a nd occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart Inter national segments' distribution facilities 
is included in operating, selling, general and admi nistrative expenses. Because the Company does not i nclude most of the cost of its Walmart 
U.S. and Walmart International segments' distributi on facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit an d gross profit as a percentage of net sales may 
not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution  facilities in cost of sales and in the 
calculation of gross profit.  
Advertising Costs  
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were  $2.4 billion for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 and $2.3 billion for fiscal 2013 . 
Advertising costs consist primarily of print, telev ision and digital advertisements and are recorded i n operating, selling, general and 
administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidat ed Statements of Income. Reimbursements from suppli ers that are for specific, 
incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in o perating, selling, general and administrative 
expenses.  
Leases  
The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where a n economic penalty exists that would 
preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of  the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise o f such renewal is at the sole discretion of 
the Company. The expected term is used in the deter mination of whether a store or club lease is a capi tal or operating lease and in the 
calculation of straight-line rent expense. Addition ally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the 
economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. I f significant expenditures are made for leasehold i mprovements late in the expected term of a 
lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful  life of the leasehold improvement is limited to th e end of the renewal period or economic 
life of the asset, whichever is shorter.  
Rent abatements and escalations are considered in t he calculation of minimum lease payments in the Com pany's capital lease tests and in 
determining straight-line rent expense for operatin g leases.  
Pre -Opening Costs  
The cost of start-up activities, including organiza tion costs, related to new store openings, store re models, relocations, expansions and 
conversions are expensed as incurred and included i n operating, selling, general and administrative ex penses in the Company's Consolidated 
Statements of Income. Pre-opening costs totaled $31 7 million , $338 million and $316 million for fisca l 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.  
Currency Translation  
The assets and liabilities of all international sub sidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date. Related translatio n adjustments are recorded as a component of accumu lated other comprehensive income (loss). 
The income statements of all international subsidia ries are translated from the respective local curre ncies to the U.S. dollar using average 
exchange rates for the period covered by the income  statements.  
Reclassifications  
Certain reclassifications have been made to previou s fiscal year amounts and balances to conform to th e presentation in the current fiscal year. 
These reclassifications did not impact consolidated  operating income or net income. Additionally, cert ain segment asset and expense 
allocations have been reclassified among segments i n the current period. See Note 14 for further discu ssion of the Company's segments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards B oard issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 201 4-08, Reporting Discontinued 
Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Componen ts of an Entity , which provides guidance for the recognition of di scontinued operations, 
changes the requirements for reporting discontinued  operations and requires additional disclosures abo ut discontinued operations. This ASU 
applies to prospective transactions beginning on or  after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permi tted. The Company adopted this ASU 
for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 and adop tion did not materially impact the Company's consol idated net income, financial position or 
cash flows.  
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Boa rd issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This ASU is a 
comprehensive new revenue recognition model that re quires a company to recognize revenue to depict the  transfer of goods or services to a 
customer at an amount that reflects the considerati on it expects to receive in exchange for those good s or services. This ASU is effective for 
annual reporting periods beginning after December 1 5, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. Accord ingly, the Company will adopt this 
ASU on February 1, 2017. Companies may use either a  full retrospective or a modified retrospective app roach to adopt this ASU. Management 
is currently evaluating this standard, including wh ich transition approach to use, and does not expect  this ASU to materially impact the 
Company's consolidated net income, financial positi on or cash flows.  
Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share  
Basic income per common share from continuing opera tions attributable to Walmart is based on the weigh ted-average common shares 
outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted inc ome per common share from continuing operations att ributable to Walmart is based on the 
weighted-average common shares outstanding during t he relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect  of share-based awards. The Company 
did not have significant share-based awards outstan ding that were antidilutive and not included in the  calculation of diluted income per 
common share from continuing operations attributabl e to Walmart for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .

Note 3. Shareholders' Equity  
Share -Based Compensation  
The Company has awarded share-based compensation to  associates and nonemployee directors of the Compan y. The compensation expense 
recognized for all plans was $462 million , $388 mi llion and $378 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2 013 , respectively. Share-based 
compensation expense is included in operating, sell ing, general and administrative expenses in the Com pany's Consolidated Statements of 
Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for  share-based compensation was $173 million , $145 m illion and $142 million for fiscal 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensa tion expense by award type:  
The Company's shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan of 2010 (the "Plan") became effective June 4, 2010 and amended and restated the 
Company's Stock Incentive Plan of 2005. The Plan wa s established to grant stock options, restricted (n on-vested) stock, performance shares 
units and other equity compensation awards for whic h 210 million shares of common stock issued or to b e issued under the Plan have been 
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as ame nded. The Company believes that such awards serve t o align the interests of its associates 
with those of its shareholders.  
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:  
In addition to the Plan, the Company's subsidiary i n the United Kingdom has stock option plans for cer tain colleagues which generally vest 
over three years. The stock option share-based comp ensation expense is included in the other line in t he table above.

•  Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest ba sed on the passage of time and 
include restrictions related to employment. Perform ance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of 
performance criteria and may range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for t hese awards are 
generally between one and three years. Restricted s tock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are 
accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidat ed Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted sto ck awards is determined on 
the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share  units is determined on the 
date of grant using the Company's stock price disco unted for the expected dividend yield through the v esting period and is 
recognized over the vesting period.  
•  Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company st ock after a specified service period; 50% vest thre e 
years from the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair v alue of each restricted stock unit is 
determined on the date of grant using the stock pri ce discounted for the expected dividend yield throu gh the vesting period and is 
recognized ratably over the vesting period. The exp ected dividend yield is based on the anticipated di vidends over the vesting 
period. The weighted-average discount for the divid end yield used to determine the fair value of restr icted stock units granted in 
fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was 9.5% , 10.3% and 12 .2% , respectively.

Share Repurchase Program  
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares o f its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of 
Directors. On June 6, 2013 , the Company's Board of  Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion shar e repurchase program, which had 
approximately $712 million of remaining authorizati on for share repurchases as of that date, with a ne w $15.0 billion share repurchase 
program, which was announced on June 7, 2013 . As w as the case with the replaced share repurchase prog ram, the current share repurchase 
program has no expiration date or other restriction s limiting the period over which the Company can ma ke share repurchases. At January 31, 
2015 , authorization for $10.3 billion of share rep urchases remained under the current share repurchas e program. Any repurchased shares are 
constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.  
The Company considers several factors in determinin g when to execute share repurchases, including, amo ng other things, current cash needs, 
capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, its resu lts of operations and the market price of its commo n stock. The following table provides, on a 
settlement date basis, the number of shares repurch ased, average price paid per share and total cash p aid for share repurchases for fiscal 2015 ,

The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fa ir value instruments further discussed in Note 8, c onsists of the following:  
At January 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had $500  million in debt with embedded put options. The iss uance of money market puttable 
reset securities in the amount of $500 million is s tructured to be remarketed in connection with the a nnual reset of the interest rate. If, for any 
reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur  at the time of any interest rate reset, the holder s of the notes must sell, and the Company 
must repurchase, the notes at par. Accordingly, thi s issuance has been classified as long-term debt du e within one year in the Company's 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
Annual maturities of long-term debt during the next  five years and thereafter are as follows:

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements  
The Company records and discloses certain financial  and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair v alue. The fair value of an asset is the price 
at which the asset could be sold in an ordinary tra nsaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willi ng parties able to engage in the 
transaction. The fair value of a liability is the a mount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such 
parties, not the amount that would be paid to settl e the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabi lities recorded at fair value are measured using 
the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inp uts used in measuring fair value. The levels of the  fair value hierarchy are:  
 
Recurring Fair Value Measurements  
The Company holds derivative instruments that are r equired to be measured at fair value on a recurring  basis. The fair values are the estimated 
amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termi nation of the related derivative agreements as of t he reporting dates. The fair values 
have been measured using the income approach and Le vel 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest r ate and foreign currency forward 
curves. As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , the notio nal amounts and fair values of these derivatives we re as follows:  
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  
In addition to assets and liabilities that are reco rded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Compan y's assets and liabilities are also subject to 
nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, as sets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring b asis as a result of impairment charges. 
The Company did not record any significant impairme nt charges to assets measured at fair value on a no nrecurring basis during the fiscal years 
ended January 31, 2015 , or 2014 .  
Other Fair Value Disclosures  
The Company records cash and cash equivalents and s hort-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values o f these instruments approximate their 
fair value due to their short-term maturities.  
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at co st. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 input s based on the Company's current 
incremental borrowing rate for similar types of bor rowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair va lue of the Company's long-term debt as 
of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , are as follows:   
 
43  •  Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in  active markets; 
•  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly obse rvable; and 
•  Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or  no market data exists, therefore requiring the Com pany to develop its own 
assumptions.

Note 8. Derivative Financial Instruments  
The Company uses derivative financial instruments f or hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its e xposure to changes in interest and 
currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. U se of derivative financial instruments in 
hedging programs subjects the Company to certain ri sks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk r epresents the possibility that the value of 
the derivative financial instrument will change. In  a hedging relationship, the change in the value of  the derivative financial instrument is offset 
to a great extent by the change in the value of the  underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to a d erivative financial instrument represents the 
possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or contrac tual, amount of the Company's derivative 
financial instruments is used to measure interest t o be paid or received and does not represent the Co mpany's exposure due to credit risk. Credit 
risk is monitored through established approval proc edures, including setting concentration limits by c ounterparty, reviewing credit ratings and 
requiring collateral (generally cash) from the coun terparty when appropriate.  
The Company only enters into derivative transaction s with counterparties rated "A-" or better by natio nally recognized credit rating agencies. 
Subsequent to entering into derivative transactions , the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings  of its counterparties. In connection with 
various derivative agreements, including master net ting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral  from counterparties of $323 million 
and $ 641 million at January 31, 2015 and January 3 1, 2014 , respectively. The Company records cash collateral  received as amounts due to the 
counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. F urthermore, as part of the master netting arrangeme nts with these counterparties, the 
Company is also required to post collateral if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds  $ 150 million with any counterparty. The 
Company did not have any cash collateral posted wit h counterparties at January 31, 2015 or January 31,  2014 . The Company records cash 
collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of a ny derivative liability.  
The Company uses derivative financial instruments f or the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, 
accordingly, the contractual terms of a hedged inst rument closely mirror those of the hedged item, pro viding a high degree of risk reduction and 
correlation. Contracts that are effective at meetin g the risk reduction and correlation criteria are r ecorded using hedge accounting. If a 
derivative financial instrument is recorded using h edge accounting, depending on the nature of the hed ge, changes in the fair value of the 
instrument will either be offset against the change  in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or  firm commitments through earnings or be 
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive incom e (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in ear nings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is 
immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's n et investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective 
portion has not been, and is not expected to be, si gnificant. Instruments that do not meet the criteri a for hedge accounting, or contracts for 
which the Company has not elected hedge accounting,  are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains o r losses reported in earnings during the 
period of the change.  
Fair Value Instruments  
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay v ariable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company u ses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate 
debt. The notional amounts are used to measure inte rest to be paid or received and do not represent th e Company's exposure due to credit loss. 
The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixe d-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value 
hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the fi xed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative 
instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective h edges. Changes in the fair values of these derivati ve instruments are recorded in earnings, 
but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair  values of the hedged items, also recorded in earni ngs, and, accordingly, do not impact the 
Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value instruments will mature in October 2020 .  
Net Investment Instruments  
The Company is a party to cross-currency interest r ate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net in vestments. The agreements are contracts 
to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for  fixed-rate payments in another currency. All chang es in the fair value of these instruments 
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive inc ome (loss), offsetting the currency translation adj ustment of the related investment that is 
also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive in come (loss). These instruments will mature on dates  ranging from October 2023 to 
February 2030 .  
The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated  long-term debt as hedges of net investments of cer tain of its foreign operations. These 
foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuanc es are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedg ing instruments. Accordingly, the 
foreign currency translation of these debt instrume nts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), offsetting the foreign 
currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is also recorded in accumulated ot her comprehensive income (loss). At 
January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014 , the Company  had ¥100 billion and ¥200 billion , respectively, of outstanding long-term debt 
designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japa n, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £2.5 bi llion at January 31, 2015 and 2014 that 
was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investm ent hedges will mature on dates 
ranging from July 2015 to January 2039 .

Cash Flow Instruments  
The Company is a party to receive variable-rate, pa y fixed-rate interest rate swaps that the Company u ses to hedge the interest rate risk of 
certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are de signated as cash flow hedges of interest expense ri sk. Amounts reported in accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss) related to these derivatives are reclassified from accumulated other  comprehensive income (loss) to 
earnings as interest is expensed for the Company's variable-rate debt, converting the variable-rate in terest expense into fixed-rate interest 
expense. These cash flow instruments will mature in  July 2015 .  
The Company is also a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps t o hedge the currency exposure associated 
with the forecasted payments of principal and inter est of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps  are designated as cash flow hedges of 
the currency risk related to payments on the non-U. S. denominated debt. The effective portion of chang es in the fair value of derivatives 
designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive  income (loss) and is subsequently 
reclassified into earnings in the period that the h edged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign 
currency-denominated liabilities that are remeasure d at spot exchange rates each period, and the asses sment of effectiveness (and measurement 
of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes i n the related derivative's cash flows. As a result,  the amount reclassified into earnings each 
period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that remeasur ement and the adjustment to earnings for 
the period's allocable portion of the initial spot- forward difference associated with the hedging inst rument. These cash flow instruments will 
mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 20 34 .  
The Company used forward starting receive variable- rate, pay fixed-rate swaps ("forward starting swaps ") to hedge its exposure to the 
variability in future cash flows due to changes in the LIBOR swap rate for debt issuances forecasted t o occur in the future. These forward 
starting swaps were terminated in October 2014, Apr il 2014 and April 2013 concurrently with the issuan ce of the hedged debt. Upon 
termination of the forward starting swaps, the Comp any received net cash payments from the related cou nterparties of $96 million in fiscal 
2015 and made net cash payments to the related coun terparties of $74 million in fiscal 2014 . The paym ents were recorded in accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recla ssified to earnings over the life of the related de bt through May 2044, effectively adjusting 
interest expense to reflect the fixed interest rate s entered into by the forward starting swaps.  
Financial Statement Presentation  
Although subject to master netting arrangements, th e Company does not offset derivative assets and der ivative liabilities in its Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. Derivative instruments with an unre alized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolida ted Balance Sheets as either current or 
non-current assets, based on maturity date, and tho se hedging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current 
liabilities, based on maturity date.  
The Company's derivative instruments, as well as it s nonderivative debt instruments designated and qua lifying as net investment hedges, were 
classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated  Balance Sheets: 
Gains and losses related to the Company's derivativ es primarily relate to interest rate hedges, which are recorded in interest, net, in the 
Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Amount s related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss) to net income dur ing the next 12 months are not significant.

Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation  
The Company's effective income tax rate is typicall y lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed 
global operations, including the use of global fund ing structures and certain U.S. tax credits as furt her discussed in the "Cash and Cash 
Equivalents" section of the Company's significant a ccounting policies in Note 1. The Company's non-U.S . income is generally subject to local 
country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statu tory tax rate. Certain non-U.S. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 
and are not subject to current U.S. income tax. A r econciliation of the significant differences betwee n the U.S. statutory tax rate and the 
effective income tax rate on pretax income from con tinuing operations is as follows:

Deferred Taxes  
The significant components of the Company's deferre d tax account balances are as follows:  
The deferred taxes are classified as follows in the  Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets:  
Unremitted Earnings  
U.S. income taxes have not been provided on accumul ated but undistributed earnings of the Company's in ternational subsidiaries of 
approximately $23.3 billion and $21.4 billion as of  January 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as the C ompany intends to permanently reinvest 
these amounts outside of the U.S. However, if any p ortion were to be distributed, the related U.S. tax  liability may be reduced by foreign 
income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not 
practicable because of the complexities with its hy pothetical calculation. The Company provides deferr ed or current income taxes on earnings 
of international subsidiaries in the period that th e Company determines it will remit those earnings.  
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances  
At January 31, 2015 , the Company had net operating  loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling appro ximately $5.6 billion . Of these 
carryforwards, approximately $2.9 billion will expi re, if not utilized, in various years through 2033 . The remaining carryforwards have no 
expiration. At January 31, 2015 , the Company had f oreign tax credit carryforwards of $2.0 billion , w hich will expire in various years through 
2025 , if not utilized.  
The recoverability of these future tax deductions a nd credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy o f future expected taxable income from all 
sources, including taxable income in prior carrybac k years, reversal of taxable temporary differences,  forecasted operating earnings and 
available tax planning strategies. To the extent ma nagement does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, a 
valuation allowance is established. If a valuation allowance has been established and management subse quently determines that it is more 
likely than not that the deferred tax assets will b e realized, the valuation allowance is released.

As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had v aluation allowances recorded of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion , 
respectively, on deferred tax assets associated pri marily with net operating loss carryforwards for wh ich management has determined it is more 
likely than not that the deferred tax asset will no t be realized. The $0.3 billion net decrease in the  valuation allowance during fiscal 2015 related 
to releases arising from the use of deferred tax as sets, changes in judgment regarding the future real ization of deferred tax assets, increases 
from certain net operating losses and deductible te mporary differences arising in fiscal 2015 , decrea ses due to operating loss expirations and 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management  believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be 
fully realized.  
Uncertain Tax Positions  
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorde d in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statement s only after determining a more likely 
than not probability that the uncertain tax positio ns will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing au thorities.  
As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , the amount of unr ecognized tax benefits related to continuing operat ions was $838 million and $763 
million , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effect ive income tax rate was $763 million 
and $698 million for January 31, 2015 and 2014 , re spectively.  
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations was as follows:  
The Company classifies interest and penalties relat ed to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense an d as operating, selling, general and 
administrative expenses, respectively. During fisca l 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company recognized int erest and penalty expense (benefit) 
related to uncertain tax positions of $18 million ,  $(7) million and $2 million , respectively. As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , accrued interest 
related to uncertain tax positions of $57 million a nd $40 million , respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company did not have any accrued penalties reco rded for income taxes as of January 31, 2015 or 201 4 .  
During the next twelve months, it is reasonably pos sible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrec ognized tax benefits by between $50 
million and $350 million , either because the tax p ositions are sustained on audit or because the Comp any agrees to their disallowance. The 
Company is focused on resolving tax audits as exped itiously as possible. As a result of these efforts,  unrecognized tax benefits could 
potentially be reduced beyond the provided range du ring the next twelve months. The Company does not e xpect any change to have a 
significant impact to its Consolidated Financial St atements.  
The Company remains subject to income tax examinati ons for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for  fiscal 2013 through 2015 . The 
Company also remains subject to income tax examinat ions for international income taxes for fiscal 2000  through 2015 , and for U.S. state and 
local income taxes generally for the fiscal years e nded 2006 through 2015 .  
Other Taxes  
The Company is subject to tax examinations for payr oll, value added, sales-based and other non- income taxes. A number of these examinations 
are ongoing in various jurisdictions, including Bra zil. In certain cases, the Company has received ass essments from the respective taxing 
authorities in connection with these examinations. Where a probable loss has occurred, the Company has  made accruals, which are reflected in 
the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Wh ile the possible losses or range of possible losses  associated with these matters are 
individually immaterial, a group of related matters , if decided adversely to the Company, could result  in a liability material to the Company's 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal Proceedings  
The Company is involved in a number of legal procee dings. The Company has made accruals with respect t o these matters, where appropriate, 
which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated F inancial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be 
reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has n ot been made. However, where a liability is reasona bly possible and may be material, such 
matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matt ers, and may enter into settlement 
agreements, if it believes settlement is in the bes t interest of the Company's shareholders.  
Unless stated otherwise, the matters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided advers ely to or settled by the Company, 
individually or in the aggregate, may result in a l iability material to the Company's financial condit ion or results of operations.  
Wage-and-Hour Class Action: The Company is a defendant in Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , a class-action lawsuit commenced in 
March 2002 in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadel phia, Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs allege that the Company failed to pay class members 
for all hours worked and prevented class members fr om taking their full meal and rest breaks. On Octob er 13, 2006 , a jury awarded back-pay 
damages to the plaintiffs of approximately $78 mill ion on their claims for off-the- clock work and missed rest breaks. The jury found i n favor of 
the Company on the plaintiffs' meal-period claims. On November 14, 2007 , the trial judge entered a fi nal judgment in the approximate amount 
of $188 million , which included the jury's back-pa y award plus statutory penalties, prejudgment inter est and attorneys' fees. By operation of 
law, post-judgment interest accrues on the judgment  amount at the rate of six percent per annum from t he date of entry of the judgment, which 
was November 14, 2007 , until the judgment is paid,  unless the judgment is set aside on appeal. On Dec ember 7, 2007 , the Company filed its 
Notice of Appeal. On June 10, 2011 , the Pennsylvania Superior Court of Appeals issued an opinion upholding the trial court 's certification of 
the class, the jury's back pay award, and the award s of statutory penalties and prejudgment interest, but reversing the award of attorneys' fees. 
On September 9, 2011 , the Company filed a Petition  for Allowance of Appeal with the Pennsylvania Supr eme Court. On July 2, 2012 , the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the Company's Pe tition. On December 15, 2014, the Pennsylvania Supr eme Court issued its opinion 
affirming the Superior Court of Appeals' decision. At that time, the Company recorded expenses of $249  million for the judgment amount and 
post-judgment interest incurred to date. The Compan y will continue to accrue for the post- judgment interest until final resolution. However, the 
Company continues to believe it has substantial fac tual and legal defenses to the claims at issue and,  on March 13, 2015, the Company filed a 
petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supre me Court.  
ASDA Equal Value Claims: ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidia ry of the Company, is a defendant in over 4,000 "eq ual 
value" claims that are proceeding before an Employm ent Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribuna l") in the United Kingdom ("UK") 
on behalf of current and former ASDA store employee s, who allege that the work performed by female emp loyees in ASDA's retail stores is of 
equal value in terms of, among other things, the de mands of their jobs to that of male employees worki ng in ASDA's warehouse and 
distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not ob jectively justified. Claimants are requesting 
differential back pay based on higher wage rates in  the warehouse and distribution facilities and thos e higher wage rates on a prospective basis 
as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA beli eves that further claims may be asserted in the nea r future. On March 23, 2015, ASDA 
asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedin gs, contending that the High Court, which is the su perior first instance civil court in the 
UK that is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Jus tice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these 
claims. On March 23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Empl oyment Tribunal to "strike out" substantially all o f the claims for failing to comply with 
Employment Tribunal rules. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may b e filed, and cannot reasonably 
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise f rom these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to 
these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigo rously.

FCPA Investigation and Related Matters  
The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company, which is compose d solely of independent directors, 
is conducting an internal investigation into, among  other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Forei gn Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and 
other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection wi th foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Méxi co, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and 
whether prior allegations of such violations and/or  misconduct were appropriately handled by the Compa ny. The Audit Committee and the 
Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting i n the on-going investigation of these 
matters.  
The Company is also conducting a voluntary global r eview of its policies, practices and internal contr ols for FCPA compliance. The Company 
is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corrupt ion compliance program through appropriate remedial  anti-corruption measures.  In 
November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed th at investigative activity to the U.S. Department of  Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since the impl ementation of the global review and the enhanced an ti-corruption compliance program, 
the Audit Committee and the Company have identified  or been made aware of additional allegations regar ding potential violations of the 
FCPA. When such allegations are reported or identif ied, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, 
conduct inquiries and when warranted based on those  inquiries, open investigations. Inquiries or inves tigations regarding allegations of 
potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operate s, including, but not limited to, 
Brazil, China and India.  
The Company has been informed by the DOJ and the SE C that it is also the subject of their respective i nvestigations into possible violations of 
the FCPA. The Company is cooperating with the inves tigations by the DOJ and the SEC. A number of feder al and local government agencies 
in Mexico have also initiated investigations of the se matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these 
investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to t he matters under investigation have been filed by s everal of the Company's shareholders 
against it, certain of its current directors, certa in of its former directors, certain of its current and former officers and certain of Walmex's 
current and former officers.  
The Company could be exposed to a variety of negati ve consequences as a result of the matters noted ab ove. There could be one or more 
enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going gove rnment investigations, and such actions, if 
brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fine s, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders,  debarment or other relief, criminal 
convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsu its may result in judgments against the Company and  its current and former directors and 
officers named in those proceedings. The Company ca nnot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the 
shareholder lawsuits, or its own internal investiga tions and review. In addition, the Company has incu rred and expects to continue to incur costs 
in responding to requests for information or subpoe nas seeking documents, testimony and other informat ion in connection with the government 
investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsui ts, and in conducting the review and investigations . These costs will be expensed as 
incurred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 20 15 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company incurred the follo wing third-party expenses in connection 
with the FCPA investigation and related matters:  
These matters may require the involvement of certai n members of the Company's senior management that c ould impinge on the time they have 
available to devote to other matters relating to th e business. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, 
including additional news articles from media publi cations on these matters, which could impact the pe rception among certain audiences of the 
Company's role as a corporate citizen.      
The Company's process of assessing and responding t o the governmental investigations and the sharehold er lawsuits continues. While the 
Company believes that it is probable that it will i ncur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, 
inquiries and investigations, the Company cannot re asonably estimate any loss or range of loss that ma y arise from these matters. Although the 
Company does not presently believe that these matte rs will have a material adverse effect on its busin ess, given the inherent uncertainties in 
such situations, the Company can provide no assuran ce that these matters will not be material to its b usiness in the future.

Note 11. Commitments  
The Company has long-term leases for stores and equ ipment. Rentals (including amounts applicable to ta xes, insurance, maintenance, other 
operating expenses and contingent rentals) under op erating leases and other short-term rental arrangem ents were $2.8 billion in both fiscal 2015 
and 2014 and $2.6 billion in fiscal 2013 .  
Aggregate minimum annual rentals at January 31, 201 5 , under non-cancelable leases are as follows:  
Certain of the Company's leases provide for the pay ment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of  sales. Such contingent rentals were not 
material for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Substant ially all of the Company's store leases have renewa l options, some of which may trigger an 
escalation in rentals.  
The Company has future lease commitments for land a nd buildings for approximately 282 future locations . These lease commitments have 
lease terms ranging from 1 to 30 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If executed, payments under operating leases would increase 
by $58 million for fiscal 2016, based on current co st estimates.  
In connection with certain long-term debt issuances , the Company could be liable for early termination  payments if certain unlikely events 
were to occur. At January 31, 2015 , the aggregate termination payment would have been $64 million . T he arrangement pursuant to which this 
payment could be made will expire in fiscal 2019 .

Walmart Chile  
In fiscal 2014, the redeemable noncontrolling inter est shareholders exercised put options that require d the Company to purchase their shares in

Note 14. Segments  
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located in the U.S., Afri ca, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central 
America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the  United Kingdom. The Company's operations are condu cted in three business segments: 
Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operatio ns whose results its chief operating 
decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyz e performance and allocate resources. The Company s ells similar individual products 
and services in each of its segments. It is impract ical to segregate and identify revenues for each of  these individual products and services.  
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mas s merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, 
as well as walmart.com. The Walmart International s egment consists of the Company's operations outside  of the U.S., including various retail 
websites. The Sam's Club segment includes the wareh ouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsc lub.com. Corporate and support 
consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.  
The Company measures the results of its segments us ing, among other measures, each segment's net sales  and operating income, which 
includes certain corporate overhead allocations. Fr om time to time, the Company revises the measuremen t of each segment's operating income, 
including any corporate overhead allocations, as de termined by the information regularly reviewed by i ts CODM. When the measurement of a 
segment changes, previous period amounts and balanc es are reclassified to be comparable to the current  period's presentation.  
Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconcilia tion to income from continuing 
operations before income taxes, is provided in the following table:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart  Stores, Inc.  
We have audited Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal co ntrol over financial reporting as of January 31, 20 15 , based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way Commission (2013 framework) 
(the COSO criteria). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s manage ment is responsible for maintaining effective inter nal control over financial reporting, and 
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal  control over financial reporting included in the a ccompanying "Management's Report to Our 
Shareholders." Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over fina ncial reporting based on our audit.  
We conducted our audit in accordance with the stand ards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boa rd (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai n reasonable assurance about whether effective inte rnal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit incl uded obtaining an understanding of internal control  over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evalua ting the design and operating effectiveness of inte rnal control based on the assessed risk, and 
performing such other procedures as we considered n ecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for 
our opinion.  
A company's internal control over financial reporti ng is a process designed to provide reasonable assu rance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statemen ts for external purposes in accordance with general ly accepted accounting principles. A 
company's internal control over financial reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pe rtain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect th e transactions and dispositions of the assets of th e company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to perm it preparation of financial statements in accordanc e with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of t he company are being made only in accordance with a uthorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonabl e assurance regarding prevention or timely detectio n of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have  a material effect on the financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal contr ol over financial reporting may not prevent or dete ct misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are s ubject to the risk that controls may become inadequ ate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
In our opinion, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, i n all material respects, effective internal control  over financial reporting as of January 31, 
2015 , based on the COSO criteria.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standa rds of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boar d (United States), the consolidated 
balance sheets of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of Janua ry 31, 2015 and 2014 , and related consolidated sta tements of income, comprehensive 
income, shareholders' equity and redeemable noncont rolling interest and cash flows for each of the thr ee years in the period ended January 31, 
2015 and our report dated April 1, 2015 expressed a n unqualified opinion thereon.
