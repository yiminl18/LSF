Our
 principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is thelargest selle
r of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively asour “NIKE Direct” operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Virtually all
of
 our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products areproduced both in the United States and abroad.
Products
 
We focus
 our NIKE Brand product offerings in six key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear (our sports-inspiredlifestyle
 products).  We  also  market  products  designed  for  kids,  as  well  as  for  other  athletic  and  recreational  uses  such  as  American  football,  baseball,  cricket,  lacrosse,skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities.
NIKE’s athletic footwea
r products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We placeconsiderable
 emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand arecurrently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.
We
 also  sell  sports  apparel  covering  the  above-mentioned  categories,  which  feature  the  same  trademarks  and  are  sold  predominantly  through  the  same  marketing  anddistribution
 channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment toinnovation
 and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparelsales.
 We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional teamand league logos.
We
 sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves,protective
 equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.
Our Jordan
 Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark.Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.
One
 of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessoriesunder
 the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alonebasis.
Another
 of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel andaccessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brand’s North America geographic operating segment.
In
 addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreementsthat
 permit  unaffiliated  parties  to  manufacture  and  sell,  using  NIKE-owned  trademarks,  certain  apparel,  digital  devices  and  applications  and  other  equipment  designed  forsports activities.

Financial
 information  about  geographic  and  segment  operations  appears  in Note  17  —  Operating  Segments  and  Related  Information of  the  accompanying  Notes  to  theConsolidated Financial Statements.
We experience
 moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in thesecond
 and  third  quarters.  However,  the  mix  of  product  sales  may  vary  considerably  as  a  result  of  changes  in  seasonal  and  geographic  demand  for  particular  types  offootwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors.
Because
 NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products.We
 must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categoriesand
 influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on oursales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We
 report  our  NIKE  Brand  operations  based  on  our  internal  geographic  organization.  Each  NIKE  Brand  geographic  segment  operates  predominantly  in  one  industry:  thedesign,
 development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. In June 2017, we announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE tobetter
 serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, the Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: NorthAmerica;
 Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Salesthrough our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.
Converse is
 also a reportable segment and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse directto consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.
United States Market
For 
fiscal 2018 , NIKE Brand and  Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 42% of total revenues, compared to 46% and 47% for fiscal 2017 and fiscal2016 
,  respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwearstores,
 sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE salesoffices to solicit such sales. During 
fiscal 2018 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 21% of sales in the United States. Our NIKE
 Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through various digital platforms. Inaddition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States:

Significant Customer
No 
customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2018 . Product Research, Design and Development
We
 believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, appareland
 athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, whilereducing waste.
In
 addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we alsoutilize
 research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with usand
 review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employeeathletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate
 products during the design and development process.As
 we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our productcategories. Using market
 intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumerpreferences.
 The  proliferation  of  NIKE  Air,  Lunar,  Zoom,  Free,  Flywire,  Dri-Fit,  Flyknit,  Flyweave,  ZoomX,  React  and  NIKE+  technologies  throughout  our  Running,  NIKEBasketball, Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear categories, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.
Manufacturing
We are supplied by 
124 footwear factories located in 13 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand footwear production.
 Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2018 
,  contract  factories  in  Vietnam,  China  and  Indonesia  manufactured  approximately  47%,  26%  and  21%  of  total  NIKE  Brand  footwear,  respectively.  We  also  havemanufacturing
 agreements  with  independent  contract  manufacturers  in  Argentina,  India,  Brazil,  Mexico  and  Italy  to  manufacture  footwear  for  sale  primarily  within  thosecountries. For 
fiscal 2018 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately69% 
of NIKE Brand footwear production. We
 are supplied by 328 apparel factories located in 37 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 13% of total fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand apparel production.
 Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2018 
,  contract factories in China, Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 26%, 18% and 10% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2018 , one apparelcontract manufacturer
 accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 47% of NIKE Brand apparel production.
The
 principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon,polyester
 and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2018 ,  Air Manufacturing Innovation, with facilities nearBeaverton,
 Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used infootwear.
 The  principal  materials  used  in  our  apparel  products  are  natural  and  synthetic  fabrics  and  threads  (both  virgin  and  recycled);  specialized  performance  fabricsdesigned
 to  efficiently  wick  moisture  away  from  the  body,  retain  heat  and  repel  rain  and/or  snow;  and  plastic  and  metal  hardware.  NIKE’s  independent  contractors  andsuppliers
 buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independentcontractors and
 suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE’s independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficultyin satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products.
Since
 1972,  Sojitz  Corporation  of  America  (“Sojitz  America”),  a  large  Japanese  trading  company  and  the  sole  owner  of  our  redeemable  preferred  stock,  has  performedsignificant
 import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2018 ,  Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKEmarkets
 including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 6% of NIKE Brandsales
 occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire productsfrom
 our  suppliers  and  to  deliver  products  to  our  customers  in  those  markets.  Such  a  disruption  could  result  in  canceled  orders  that  would  adversely  affect  sales  andprofitability.
 However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates.Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2019.
International Operations and Trade
Our
 international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign anddomestic
 trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certainparts
 of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effectsoccurring in the future.

Table of ContentsIn
 recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. Thesetrends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing
trade
 protectionism  in many  different  regions,  and  in nearly  all cases  we  are working  together  with  industry  groups  to  address  trade  issues  and reduce  the  impact  to theindustry,
 while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additionalmeasures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
We
 monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes tomitigate trade
 restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for andadvocating against
 other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and
 potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S., including NIKE. There have also beendiscussions and comm
entary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy, and certain foreign governments haveinstituted
 or  are  considering  imposing  trade  sanctions  on  certain  U.S.  goods,  which  could  negatively  affect  U.S.  corporations  with  business  operations  and/or  consumermarkets
 in  those  countries.  Depending  on  the  extent  that  certain  new  or  proposed  reforms  are  implemented  by  the  U.S.  government  and  the  manner  in  which  foreigngovernments
 respond to such reforms, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Inaddition 
, with  respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broadcoalition
 of  global  businesses  and  trade  associations  representing  a  wide  variety  of  sectors  to  help  ensure  that  any  legislation  enacted  and  implemented  (i)  addresseslegitimate
 and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers China ’ s domestic economy and the important role it has in theglobal economic community.
Where
 trade  protection  measures  are  implemented,  we  believe  that  we  have  the  ability  to  develop,  over  a  period  of  time,  adequate  alternative  sources  of  supply  for  theproducts
 obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarilydisrupted
 and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supplywould, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be
 as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements.
Our
 international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. Wesource
 a  significant  portion  of  our  products  from,  and  have  important  consumer  markets,  outside  of  the  United  States,  and  we  have  policies  and  procedures  to  addresscompliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners.
Competition
The
 athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisurefootwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel
and
 equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapidchanges
 in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in ouroperations.
NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of
 competition in this industry are:•
Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. •
Consumer  connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction;  customer support and service;identification
 with prominent and influential athletes, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products andactive engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.
•
Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.
Trademarks and Patents
We
 believe  that  our  intellectual  property  rights  are  important  to  our  brand,  our  success  and  our  competitive  position.  We  pursue  available  protections  of  these  rights  andvigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.
We
 utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, inidentifying
 our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh trademarks to be among our mostvaluable
 assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing ourproducts.
 We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademarkregistrations.
We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. In some instances, we also obtain registered copyrights.
We own patents and have a license under other patents, which facilitate our use of
 “Air” technologies.We
 file  for,  own  and  maintain  many  U.S.  and  foreign  utility  patents,  as  well  as  many  U.S.  and  foreign  design  patents  protecting  components,  technologies,  materials,manufacturing
 techniques, features, functionality, and industrial and aesthetic designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel,athletic equipment and digital devices and related software applications. These patents expire at various times.
4

Table of ContentsWe
 believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patentand trade secret positions.
However,
 we have followed a policy of filing patent applications  in the United States  and select foreign countries on inventions,  designs and improvements that we deemvaluable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement.
Employees
As
 of May  31, 2018 ,  we had approximately 73,100 employees  worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management is committed to maintaining an environmentwhere all NIKE employ
ees have the opportunity to reach their full potential. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Asia Pacific&
 Latin America geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local lawsrequire employee representation by works
 councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union.In
 certain  European  countries,  we  are  required  by  local  law  to  enter  into  and/or  comply  with  industry-wide  or  national  collective  bargaining  agreements.  NIKE  has  neverexperienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.

 incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives inthis report, other
 reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities LitigationReform
 Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that maypredict,

 “will  likely  result”  or  words  or  phrases  of  similar  meaning.  Forward-looking  statements  involve  risks  and  uncertainties  which  may  cause  actual  results  to  differmateriall
y from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms8-K,
 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overallathletic
 footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment forconsumers
 and  endorsers;  demographic  changes;  changes  in  consumer  preferences;  popularity  of  particular  designs,  categories  of  products  and  sports;  seasonal  andgeographic dem
and for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various marketfactors
 described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE’s increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, withoutlimitation,
 the  systems  related  to  demand  and  supply  planning  and  inventory  control;  interruptions  in  data  and  information  technology  systems;  consumer  data  security;fluctuations
 and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes inshipment timin
g, the changing mix of orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growthand
 inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE’s products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new productdevelopment and introduction; the
 ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adversepublicity,
 including  without  limitation,  through  social  media  or  in  connection  with  brand  damaging  events;  the  loss  of  significant  customers  or  suppliers;  dependence  ondistributors
 and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline inNIKE’s debt ratings; changes in busines
s strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation,exchange
 rate fluctuations, inflation, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; the impact of recent U.S. tax reform legislation on our resultsof operations; the potential impact of
 new laws, regulations or policy, including, without limitation, tariffs, import/export, trade and immigration regulations or policies; changes ingovernment regulations; the impact
 of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings and otherclaims
 asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and any negative public perception with respect to key personnel; the effects of NIKE’sdecision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports.
The risks included here ar
e not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE’s business and financial performance.Moreover, NIKE operates
 in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all suchrisks, nor can
 it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE’s business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose
 contained  in  any  forward-looking  statements.  Given  these  risks  and  uncertainties,  investors  should  not  place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  as  aprediction of actual results.
Investors
 should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE’s policy to disclose to them any material non-public
 information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by anyanalyst
 irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts con
tain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.Our products face intense competition.
NIKE
 is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. Theathletic footwear, appar
el and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athleticand
 leisure  footwear  companies,  athletic  and leisure  apparel  companies,  sports  equipment  companies  and large companies  having  diversified  lines of  athletic  and leisurefootwear,
 apparel and equipment.  We also compete with other companies for the production  capacity of independent  manufacturers  that produce our products.  Our NIKEDirect operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products.
Product
 offerings,  technologies,  marketing  expenditures  (including  expenditures  for  advertising  and  endorsements),  pricing,  costs  of  production,  customer  service,  digitalcommerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in
 technology and consumer preferences in the markets forathletic
 and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shiftsin
 the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we donot adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly.
Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business.
Our
 iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting andgrowing
 our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitmentto
 product  innovation  and  quality  and  our  continuing  investment  in  design  (including  materials)  and  marketing  may  not  have  the  desired  impact  on  our  brand  image  andreputation.
 In  addition,  our  success  in  maintaining,  extending  and  expanding  our  brand  image  depends  on  our  ability  to  adapt  to  a  rapidly  changing  media  environment,including
 our  increasing  reliance  on  social  media  and  digital  dissemination  of  advertising  campaigns.  We  could  be  adversely  impacted  if  we  fail  to  achieve  any  of  theseobjectives.

Table of ContentsOur
 brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us,our
 products or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims areaccurate.
 Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adversepublicity about
 regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-termdemand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If
 the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if wereceive negative publicity, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
If
 we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenuesand profits.
Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate,
 gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner.However,
 lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of ourproducts
 are  subject  to  changing  consumer  preferences  that  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  Our  new  products  may  not  receive  consumer  acceptance  as  consumerpreferences could shift rapidly to
 different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our abilityto anticipate and respond
 to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing productofferings,
 developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lowersales,
 excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market ourproducts globally
 through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If wedo
 not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.
We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our
 products.Technical
 innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of ourproducts.
 Research  and  development  play  a  key  role  in  technical  innovation.  We  rely  upon  specialists  in  the  fields  of  biomechanics,  chemistry,  exercise  physiology,engineering,
 industrial  design,  sustainability  and  related  fields,  as  well  as  research  committees  and  advisory  boards  made  up  of  athletes,  coaches,  trainers,  equipmentmanagers, orthopedist
s, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athleticperformance,
 reduce injury and maximize comfort,  if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products,  consumer demand for our products could decline, and if weexperience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.
Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-qual
ity endorsers of our products could harm our business.We
 establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well asestablish
 product authenticity with consumers. However,  as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorshipsand other
 relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or todo
 so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increaseour marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed.
Furthermore,
 if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actionstaken
 by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could alsoseriously
 harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by ourendorsers,
 a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, or public figures, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsementarrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.
General
 economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation andcurrency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.
A
 majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases ourexposure
 to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there has been, and may continueto
 be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom’s impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit” and new or proposedU.S.
 policy changes. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses couldbe
 affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening offoreign
 currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchangerate
 fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive andmore difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an
 adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We
 may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results.Since
 the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reducethe
 positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to theforeign curren
cies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.7

Table of ContentsGlobal economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
The
 uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economicand
 financial  market  conditions  do  not  improve  or  deteriorate,  the  following  factors  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results  and  financialcondition:
•
Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higherdiscounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.
•
In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.•
We  conduct  transactions  in  various  currencies,  which  increases  our  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  Dollar.  Continuedvolatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies, including in response to certain policies advocated or implemented by
the U.S. presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.
•
Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives)could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.
•
If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this couldresult
 in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greaterexpense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.
•
If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of ourproducts to consumers.
•
If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase rawmaterials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.
Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.
We experience
 moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in thesecond
 and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand forparticular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as
 the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, amongothers. In
 addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able toaccurately
 predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factorsthat
 are  beyond  our  control,  including  general  economic  conditions,  changes  in  consumer  preferences,  weather  conditions,  availability  of  import  quotas,  transportationdisruptions
 and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect  our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate.  Our operating margins are alsosensitive
 to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic salestrends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of 
the results to be expected for any future period.We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.
We
 extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of productionand
 the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. Theseadvance
 orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling witheconomic uncertainty. In
 the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, ourability
 to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. Aslowing
 or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations
 and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers,which
 requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales andorders for our products.
Failure to accurately fore
cast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreasedoperating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business.
To meet
 anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which wehold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand
may
 result  in  inventory  write-downs,  and  the  sale  of  excess  inventory  at  discounted  prices  could  significantly  impair  our  brand  image  and  have  an  adverse  effect  on  ouroperating
 results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products werequire
 at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor andconsumer relations
hips and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition andcash
 flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we areunlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.

Table of ContentsConsolidation
 of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk andimpair our ability to sell products.
The
 athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with manystores.
 These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate ourcredit
 risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditionalretail,
 it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in aparticular
 country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number ofother retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.
Our
 NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and aresubject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
Our
 NIKE  Direct  stores  have  required  substantial  fixed  investment  in  equipment  and  leasehold  improvements,  information  systems  and  personnel.  We  have  entered  intosubstantial
 operating  lease  commitments  for  retail  space.  Certain  stores  have  been  designed  and  built  to  serve  as  high-profile  venues  to  promote  brand  awareness  andmarketing
 activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associ
ated with our NIKE Direct operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poor performanceof individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.
Many factors
 unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud;mismanagement
 of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions inthe areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business.
If
 the  technology-based  systems  that  give  our  customers  the  ability  to  shop  with  us  online  do  not  function  effectively,  our  operatingresults, as well as our ability to grow our digi
tal commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.Many of
 our customers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, customers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with ourcompetitors,
 and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means toenhance
 their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment ofmerchandis
e with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the lossof
 digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and couldhave a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Risks specific to
 our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers’ brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experiencethrough
 direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as wellas damage our reputation and brands.
Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.
We
 periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing ourintellectual
 property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from ourproducts.
The
 actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable toprevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.
We
 may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also
 may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importationand/or sale of certain products.
We
 take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractualmeasures
 such  as  entering  into  non-disclosure  and  non-compete  agreements  and  agreements  relating  to  our  collaborations  with  third  parties  and  providing  confidentialinformation
 awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might notalways
 be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personaldata
 could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position,and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.
In
 addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may facesignificant
 expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfullyprotect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.
We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.
We
 currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail tosuccessfully
 market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships,supplier
 relationships  or  credit  risks,  it  could  adversely  affect  our  revenues,  both  directly  from  reduced  royalties  received  and  indirectly  from  reduced  sales  of  our  otherproducts.

Table of ContentsWe
 also  rely  on  our  licensees  to  help  preserve  the  value  of  our  brands.  Although  we  attempt  to  protect  our  brands  through  approval  rights  over  the  design,  productionprocesses,
 quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands byour licensees. The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on 
that brand and on us. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation.
In
 addition  to  our  own  sensitive  and  proprietary  business  information,  we  collect  transactional  and  personal  information  about  our  customers  and  users  of  our  digitalexperiences,
 which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticatedand
 operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our or our service providers’ network, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidentialbusiness
 and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers’, users’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could havea
 material adverse effect on our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting inlost
 sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond toand/or redress problems caused by any breach.
In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S., Europe and
 elsewhere. Forexample,
 the  European  Union  adopted  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (the  “GDPR”),  which  became  effective  on  May  25,  2018.  The  GDPR  imposes  additionalobligations
 on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing,proposed
 and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR) and regulations can be costly; any failure tocomply
 with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of dataprivacy
 laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impacton revenues and profits.
Failure
 of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harmour business.
We
 work  with  hundreds  of  contractors  outside  of  the  United  States  to  manufacture  our  products,  and  we  also  have  license  agreements  that  permit  unaffiliated  parties  tomanufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors tha
t directly manufacture our products and our licensees thatmake
 products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safetystandards
 for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations,from
 time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on theircontractors.
 Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as aresult,
 could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditionsof any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses.
Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our
 business.Virtually
 all  of  our  athletic  footwear  and  apparel  is  manufactured  outside  of  the  United  States,  and  the  majority  of  our  products  are  sold  outside  of  the  United  States.Accordingly,
 we  are  subject  to  the  risks  generally  associated  with  global  trade  and  doing  business  abroad,  which  include  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  varying  consumerpreferences across geographic regions, political unrest,
 disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our productsare
 manufactured  or  where  we  sell  products.  This  includes,  for  example,  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  effect  of  Brexit,  including  changes  to  the  legal  and  regulatoryframework that
 apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union, as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the U.S.and
 elsewhere as further described below under “ We  could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in oureffective tax rate 
” and “ Changes to  U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations 
. ” The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and productionactivities
 to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which may require us to change the way we conduct businessand adversely affect our results of operations. The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.
S. multinational corporations in public statements which, ifdirected at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.
In
 addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability tomanufacture
 products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these orother
 factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our importedproducts
 are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country inwhich
 our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to preventterrorism,
 restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We
 could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective taxrate.
We
 are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  in  the  United  States  and  numerous  foreign  jurisdictions.  Current  economic  and  political  conditions  make  tax  laws  and  regulations,  or  theirinterpretation
 and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. On  December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), whichincludes
 a number of significant changes to previous U.S. tax laws that impact us, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributedforeign
 earnings,  and  a  reduction  in  the  corporate  tax  rate  from  35%  to  21%  for  tax  years  beginning  after  December  31,  2017,  among  other  changes.  The  Tax  Act  alsotransitions U.S. internat
ional taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which hasthe effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation.
10

Table of ContentsImplementati
on of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. Adjustments to theincremental
 provisional tax expense may be made in future periods as actual amounts may differ due to, among other factors, a change in interpretation of the applicablerevisions to
 the U.S. tax code and related tax accounting guidance, changes in assumptions made in developing these estimates, regulatory guidance that may be issued withrespect
 to the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code, and state tax implications. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, we may make adjustments to provisionalamounts
 we have recorded, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes  or challenges to or the repeal of the Tax Actcannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material impact on our future tax expense.
We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are
 subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws thatcould
 significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass,several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash 
flows.Portions
 of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These taxholidays and
 rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if wefail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate,
 our effective income tax rate would increase in the future.We
 are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofan
 adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, thefinal
 determination  of  tax  audits  and  any  related  disputes  could  be  materially  different  from  our  historical  income  tax  provisions  and  accruals,  particularly  in  light  of  theenactment
 of the Tax Act. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicablefinal
 determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although webelieve
 we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustainadjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.
Changes
 to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations.
Changes
 in  U.S.  or  international  social,  political,  regulatory  and  economic  conditions  or  in  laws  and  policies  governing  foreign  trade,  manufacturing,  development  andinvestment
 in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of suchchanges,
 could  adversely  affect  our  business.  The  U.S.  presidential  administration  has  instituted  or  proposed  changes  in  trade  policies  that  include  the  negotiation  ortermination
 of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other governmentregulations
 affecting  trade  between  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  where  we  conduct  our  business.  It  may  be  time-consuming  and  expensive  for  us  to  alter  our  businessoperations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.
As a result of recent policy changes of the U.S. presidential administration and recent U.S.
 government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentiveson
 international  trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S.  trade policy could trigger retaliatory  actions  by affected  countries,  and certain foreign  governments  haveinstituted
 or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount ofbusiness
 that  would  be  impacted  by  changes  to  the  trade  policies  of  the  U.S.  and  foreign  countries  (including  governmental  action  related  to  tariffs,  international  tradeagreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S.
 economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand forour products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
 operations.If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions defaul
t on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.As
 part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, optioncontracts,
 collars  and  swaps  with  various  financial  institutions.  In  addition,  we  have  significant  amounts  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  other  investments  on  deposit  or  inaccounts
 with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financialinstitutions.
 The  risk  of  counterparty  default  or  failure  may  be  heightened  during  economic  downturns  and  periods  of  uncertainty  in  the  financial  markets.  If  one  of  ourcounterparti
es were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with suchcounterparty, may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one
 ormore of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.
NIKE
 is supplied by 124 footwear factories located in 13 countries. We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing  facilities and depend upon independentcontract
 manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2018 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal2018 
footwear  production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of  NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2018 .  Our ability to meet our customers’ needsdepends
 on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever theirrelationship
 with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, we may not be able to obtain replacement productsin
 a  timely  manner,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  sales,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  Additionally,  if  any  of  our  primary  contractmanufacturers
 fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a materialadverse effect on our results of operations.

Table of ContentsOur products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.
The
 principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture awayfrom
 the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principalmaterials
 used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and syntheticfabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon 
the abilityof
 our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wagerates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the coun
tries in which our products are manufactured.There
 could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not beable
 to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced andmay
 continue  to  experience  in  the  future,  unexpected  increases  in  work  wages,  whether  government  mandated  or  otherwise  and  increases  in  compliance  costs  due  togovernmental
 regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be ableto
 fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer,there
 can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or atall, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our
 requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find newmanufacturing
 or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in ourmethods, products,
 quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials ormanufacture
 of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and netincome both in the short- and long-term.
Because
 independent  manufacturers  make  a  majority  of  our  products  outside  of  our  principal  sales  markets,  our  products  must  be  transported  by  third  parties  over  largegeographic distances. Dela
ys in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or otherfactors,
 and  costs  and  delays  associated  with  consolidating  or  transitioning  between  manufacturers,  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  performance.  In  addition,manufacturing
 delays  or  unexpected  demand  for  our  products  may  require  us  to  use  faster,  but  more  expensive,  transportation  methods  such  as  air  freight,  which  couldadversely
 affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products canadversely affect
 our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could alsohave a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2018, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services
for
 NIKE  Brand  products  sold  in  certain  NIKE  markets  including  Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,  India,  South  Africa  and  Uruguay  (collectively  the  “Sojitz  Markets”),  excludingproducts
 produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt our ability toacquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the
 Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affectsales and profitability.
Our success depends on our global distribution facilities.
We
 distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations,manage
 inventory,  complete  sales  and  achieve  objectives  for  operating  efficiencies  and  growth,  particularly  in  emerging  markets,  depends  on  the  proper  operation  of  ourdistribution
 facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved inshipping
 product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes orfires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilitie
s could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequatelyprotect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.
We rely significantly on
 information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure,inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to ef
fectively operate our business.We
 are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services (“Information Technology Systems”), across oursupply chain, includ
ing product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information forexternal and
 internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and ourbusiness
 processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and toship
 products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implementedInformation Techn
ology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in ourglobal
 operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches,viruses, hacker
s, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems withtransitioning
 to  upgraded  or  replacement  systems  could  cause  delays  in  product  fulfillment  and  reduced  efficiency  of  our  operations,  could  require  significant  capitalinvestments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results o
f operations and financial condition.We
 also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financialreporting,
 legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of ourvendors,
 do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits,as
 well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumerengagement
 and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world betweenand among our employees as well as with other third part
ies, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems mayimpede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.

Table of ContentsThe market for prime real estate is competitive.
Our
 ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability ofreal
 estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew ourexisting
 real  estate  leases.  In  addition,  from  time  to  time,  we  seek  to  downsize,  consolidate,  reposition  or  close  some  of  our  real  estate  locations,  which  may  requiremodification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of
our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and 
financial condition.Additionally,
 the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact thequality
 of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of thesedecisions
 could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which couldhave an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Extreme
 weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operatingresults
 and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their relatedconsequences
 and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result ineconomic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.
From time
 to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses,such
 as  our  digital  commerce  operations,  which  require  substantial  cash  investments  and  management  attention.  We  believe  cost-effective  investments  are  essential  tobusiness growth
 and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existingbusiness.
 The  failure  of  any  significant  investment  to  provide  expected  returns  or  profitability  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  results  and  divertmanagement attention from more profitable business operations.
We
 are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
As
 a  multinational  corporation  with  operations  and  distribution  channels  throughout  the  world,  we  are  subject  to  extensive  laws  and  regulations  in  the  U.S.  and  otherjurisdict
ions in which we have operations and distribution channels. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigationsrelating
 to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust,trademark
 rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and wecould
 in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition
 and  results  of  operations  and  negatively  impact  our  reputation.  The  global  nature  of  our  business  means  legal  and  compliance  risks  will  continue  to  exist  andadditional
 legal proceedings  and other  contingencies  will arise from time to time,  which could  adversely  affect  us.  In addition,  the adoption  of new laws or regulations,  orchanges
 in  the  interpretation  of  existing  laws  or  regulations,  may  result  in  significant  unanticipated  legal  and  reputational  risks.  Any  current  or  future  legal  or  regulatoryproceedings could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.
The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel.
Our
 success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, orany
 negative  perception  with  respect  to  these  individuals,  could  harm  our  business.  Our  success  also  depends  on  our  ability  to  recruit,  retain  and  engage  our  personnelsufficiently, both
 to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful inattracting
 and retaining such personnel. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees whoare from outside the U.S.
The sale of a
 large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.As
 of June 30, 2018, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 77% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2018, all of these shares were converted into Class BCommon
 Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 17%. The shares are available for resale, subject to therequirements
 of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantialnumber
 of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to holdthe majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Swoosh, LLC is controlled by Mr. Knight's son and NI
KE director, Travis Knight.Changes
 in  our  credit  ratings  or  macroeconomic  conditions  may  affect  our  liquidity,  increasing  borrowing  costs  and  limiting  ourfinancing options.
Our
 long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term
 debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subjectto
 restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, makeinvestments,
 loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenantscould
 result  in  a  default,  and  as  a  result,  the  commitments  of  our  lenders  under  our  credit  agreements  may  be  terminated  and  the  maturity  of  amounts  owed  may  beaccelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.

Table of ContentsIf our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Our
 internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements  because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  including  the  possibility  of  human  error,  thecircumvention
 or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation offinancial
 statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experiencedifficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
If
 our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adverselyaffected.
The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make estimatesand
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and onvarious other
 assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations.”
 The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue andexpenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related
to
 revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plantand
 equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may beadversely
 affected  if  our  assumptions  change  or  if  actual  circumstances  differ  from  those  in  our  assumptions,  which  could  cause  our  operating  results  to  fall  below  theexpectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.
Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.
There
 are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt todeny
 coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, afreeze-out statute, two classes of stock that
 vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directorsrounded
 down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of ourcompany that some sharehol
ders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing marketprice. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.
We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.
Our
 Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports includeinformation
 about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance. Analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are oftendifferent
 from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price coulddecline.
 In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stockprice
 is  volatile  for  any  reason,  we  may  become  involved  in  this  type  of  litigation  in  the  future.  Any  litigation  could  result  in  reputational  damage,  substantial  costs  and  adiversion of management’s attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.

sis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations
NIKE
 designs,  develops,  markets  and  sells  athletic  footwear,  apparel,  equipment,  accessories  and  services  worldwide.  We  are  the  largest  seller  of  athletic  footwear  andapparel
 in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), toretail
 accounts  and  a  mix  of  independent  distributors,  licensees  and  sales  representatives  in  virtually  all  countries  around  the  world.  Our  goal  is  to  deliver  value  to  ourshareholde
rs by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growthby
 creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digitalplatforms and at retail.
In
 June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveragingthe power of digital, NIKE plans to drive gro
wth — by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one
 connections. As  a  result  of  this  organizational  realignment,  beginning  in  fiscal  2018,  the  Company’s  reportable  operating  segments  for  the  NIKE  Brand  are:  NorthAmerica; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific &
 Latin America (APLA).Through
 the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to marketand
 growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are asfollows:
•
High single-digit revenue growth; •
Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points ; •
Slight selling and administrative expense leverage; •
Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and •
Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital. Over
 the past ten years, we have achieved strong growth in many of these metrics. During this time, revenues for NIKE, Inc. have grown 7% on an annual compounded basis,annual gross margin has ranged from 43.5% to 46.4%, diluted earnings per common share has grown steadily and our return on invested capital has been as high as 34.7%.
Our
 fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities in support of our Triple Double strategy tofuel
 our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues for fiscal 2018, growing 6% to $36.4 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over90%
 of  NIKE,  Inc. Revenues ,  delivered  7%  revenue  growth.  On  a  currency-neutral  basis,  NIKE  Brand  revenues  grew  5%,  driven  by  strong  revenue  growth  across  allinternationa
l geographies and NIKE Direct, as well as growth in footwear, apparel and most key categories. Revenues for Converse decreased 8% and 11% on a reported andcurrency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by lower revenues in North America.
Income
 before income taxes decreased  11% for fiscal 2018, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue growth was morethan
 offset by higher selling and administrative expense, gross margin contraction, and a shift to other expense, net from other income, net for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. grossmargin
 decreased  80  basis  points  primarily  due  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  headwinds.  Selling  and  administrative  expense  was  higher  as  a  percent  of  revenues,reflecting investments in digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive long-term growth under the Consumer Direct Offense.
Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.
While
 foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing ourbusiness to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Throughout
 this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  discuss  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  including  references  to  wholesale  equivalent  revenues  and  currency-neutralrevenues,
 which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generallyaccepted
 in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brandmarket
 footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal salesfrom
 our  wholesale  operations  to  our  NIKE  Direct  operations,  which  are  charged  at  prices  comparable  to  those  charged  to  external  wholesale  customers.  Additionally,currency-n
eutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trendsexcluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Management
 uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company ’ s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally,management
 believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlyingbusiness
 performance  and  trends.  However,  references  to  wholesale  equivalent  revenues  and  currency-neutral  revenues  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  asubstitute
 for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used byother companies.

Compared to Fiscal 2017 On
 a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew  4% for fiscal 2018, driven by growth in the NIKE Brand. All international NIKE Brand geographies delivered higherrevenues
 for fiscal  2018  as our Consumer  Direct  Offense  delivered  innovative  products,  deep  brand  connections  and compelling  retail  experiences  to consumers  throughdigital platfor
ms and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based, as Greater China, EMEA and APLAeach
 contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues .  For fiscal 2018, lower revenues from North America and Converse each reducedNIKE, Inc.  
Revenues  by approximately 1 percentage point. On a currency-neutral bas
is, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 4% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2018, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased4%.
 On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was due to strong growth in Sportswear and Running, which was partially offset by lower revenues inseveral
 other  categories,  most  notably  the  Jordan  Brand.  Footwear  unit  sales  for  fiscal  2018  increased  2%  and  higher  average  selling  price  (ASP)  per  pair  contributedapproximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.
The currency-n
eutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2018 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, NIKE Basketball andFootball
 (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 4% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due tohigher ASPs from full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct sales.
For
 fiscal 2018, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 30% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 28% for fiscal 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKEDirect
 revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2018, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25%, the addition of new stores and 4% comparable store sales growth.Comparable
 store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has beenopen
 at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the pastyear.
 On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017,and represented approximately 27% of our total NIKE Brand NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to 24%
 for fiscal 2017.On
 a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 5%, as growth in Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball morethan
 offset  lower  Football  (Soccer)  and  Jordan  Brand  revenues.  Women’s  revenues  increased  2%,  led  by  growth  in  Sportswear,  partially  offset  by  a  decline  in  Training.Revenues for our Young Athletes’ business decreased 1%, as growth in Football (Soccer), was more than offset by

Fiscal 2018 
Compared to Fiscal 2017 Our
 effective tax rate was 55.3% for fiscal 2018, reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The  impact of the Tax Act primarily reflects provisionalexpense
 of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and $158 million resulting from the remeasurement ofdeferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the
 effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements
 during fiscal 2018. The  increase in the effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Act was partially offset by the tax benefit from stock-based compensationin the current period as a result of the adoption of Accounting S
tandards Update (ASU) 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Refer to  
Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional infor mation on the impact ofASU 2016-09, and Note 9 — Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of 
the Tax Act.Fiscal 2017 
Compared to Fiscal 2016 The 550 basis point
 decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution withthe IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in 
the United States.Operating Segments
Our
 operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company’s internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operationsparticipating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each
 NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment.The
 Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America, andinclude results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands.
The Company’s
 NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in oneindustry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.
As
 part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in ourgeographic
 operating  segments  and  Converse.  These  rates  are  set  approximately  nine  and  twelve  months  in  advance  of  the  future  selling  seasons  to  which  they  relate(specifically,
 for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons)based
 on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for  geographic operating segments andConverse
 reflect  the  use  of  these  standard  rates  to  record  non-functional  currency  product  purchases  into  the  entity’s  functional  currency.  Differences  between  assignedstandard
 foreign  currency  rates  and  actual  market  rates  are  included  in  Corporate,  together  with  foreign  currency  hedge  gains  and  losses  generated  from  our  centrallymanaged foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

 the current marketplace environment, we believe there has been a meaningful shift in the way consumers shop for product and make purchasing decisions. Consumers aredemanding
 a  constant  flow  of  fresh  and  innovative  product,  and  have  an  expectation  for  superior  service  and  real-time  delivery,  all  fueled  by  the  shift  toward  digital.Specifically,
 in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels.The
 evolution of the North America marketplace has resulted in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building in ourbusiness, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital.

d 2%, as growth in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories was more than offset by declines in all other categories, most notably theJordan Brand and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 5% for fiscal 2018 due to digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores.
Footwear
 revenues declined 4% for fiscal 2018, as lower revenues in nearly all categories, most notably the Jordan Brand, more than offset higher revenues in Sportswear.Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while ASP per pair contributed approximately 1 percentage point of footwear growth, driven by the
 favorable impact of growth in our NIKEDirect business.
Apparel revenue growth of
 1% for fiscal 2018 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories, which was only partially offset by declinesin
 nearly  all  other  categories.  Unit  sales  of  apparel  decreased  4%,  while  higher  ASP  per  unit  contributed  approximately  5  percentage  points  of  apparel  revenue  growth,primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and, to a lesser extent, higher full-price ASP and 
favorable changes in off-price sales.EBIT
 declined 7% for fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as lower full-priceASP more
 than offset the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead expense resultingfrom continued investm
ents in our growing NIKE Direct business. Demand creation expense also increased, as higher sports marketing costs were only partially offset by lowerretail brand presentation costs.
Fiscal 2017

 excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overheadas
 continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retailbrand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs.

al basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 17%, driven by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Running, Sportswear and theJordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 32%, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 9%.
The
 currency-neutral increase in footwear revenue for fiscal 2017 was driven by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Running, Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.Unit sales of footwear increa
sed 21%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points as higher off-price ASP was more thanoffset by lower NIKE Direct ASP and unfavorable off-price mix.
The
 currency-neutral apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was due to higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of apparelincreased
 15% and higher ASP per unit increased apparel revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points. The increase in ASP per unit was attributable to higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower ASP in our NIKE Direct business and unfavorable of
f-price mix.Despite
 the negative impact of translation, reported EBIT increased 10% for fiscal 2017 driven by higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage, partiallyoffset
 by  lower  gross  margin.  Gross  margin  contracted  240  basis  points  primarily  due  to  unfavorable  standard  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  higher  product  costs.Selling
 and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead to support NIKE Direct growth. Demand creation expense also increased as higher marketingcosts more than offset lower retail brand presentation and sports marketing expenses.

Compared to Fiscal 2017 On
 a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 10%, driven by higher revenues in every territory. Territory revenue growth was broad-based, led by SOCO (whichcomprises
 Argentina, Uruguay and Chile), which grew 19%. Revenues increased in all key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 21%,fueled by comparable store sales growth of 11%, strong digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores.
The 9%
 increase in currency-neutral footwear revenues for fiscal 2018 was attributable to growth in every key category, led by Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of footwearincreased 5% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.
Currency-neutral
 apparel  revenues  grew  15%  for  fiscal  2018,  driven  by  higher  revenues  in  every  key  category,  most  notably  Sportswear  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  Football(Soccer),
 Training  and  NIKE  Basketball.  Unit  sales  of  apparel  increased  11%  and  higher  ASP  per  unit  contributed  approximately  4  percentage  points  of  apparel  revenuegrowth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, favorable off-price mix and higher off-price ASP.
Reported
 EBIT increased 21% due to revenue growth, strong selling and administrative  expense leverage and gross margin expansion.  Gross margin increased 90 basispoints as
 higher full-price ASP and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates more than offset higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased ashigher
 operating overhead costs resulting from continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business more than offset lower demand creation expense. The decrease indemand creation expense was primarily attributable to lower marketing costs as a result of prior year investments to support the Rio Olympics.
Fiscal 2017 
Compared to Fiscal 2016 On
 a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 13%. Revenue growth was broad-based across all territories, led by SOCO, Korea and Mexico, whichgrew 34%, 14%
 and 18%, respectively. Additionally, revenues increased in all key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. NIKE Direct revenues increased 21%, fueled bythe addition of new stores, comparable store sales growth of 11% and higher digital commerce sales.
The increase in
 currency-neutral footwear revenue for fiscal 2017 was attributable to growth in all key categories, most notably Running and Sportswear. Unit sales of footwearincreased
 9%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP, in part reflectinginflationary conditions in certain territories.
Currency-neutral
 growth in apparel revenue was fueled by increases in all key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2017, unit sales of apparel increased 3%and
 higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP,in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories.
Reported
 EBIT decreased 2%, in part reflecting the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso and Mexican Peso. Reportedrevenue
 growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased 370 basis points as higher full-priceASP
 was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higheroperating overhead costs primaril
y resulting from ongoing investments in our growing NIKE Direct business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies. Demand creationexpense
 also increased as lower advertising costs were more than offset by increased marketing support for the Rio Olympics in the first quarter, as well as higher sportsmarketing costs.

Fiscal 2018 
Compared to Fiscal 2017 On a
 currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse declined 11% for fiscal 2018. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution modelfor

 direct  distribution  market  unit  sales  decreased  14%,  while  higher  ASP  per  unit  contributed  approximately  2  percentage  points  of  direct  distribution  marketsrevenue growth. On a territory bas
is, the decrease in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to declines in both the United States and Europe,
 in part reflecting efforts to manage inventory levels in the marketplace ,  partially offset by revenue growth in Asia. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distributionincreased total Converse revenues by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2018.
 Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 14%, reducing total Converserevenues by approximately 1 percentage point, driven by lower revenues in Latin America.
Reported
 EBIT declined 35% for fiscal 2018 driven by lower revenues, higher selling and administrative expense and, to a lesser extent, gross margin contraction.  Grossmargin
 decreased 100 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by higher product costs and the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues. Selling andadministrative
 expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Higher operating overhead expense was due to continued investment inour
 direct  to  consumer  business  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  higher  wage-related  costs,  while  higher  demand  creation  expense  was  due  to  increased  marketing  support  forinitiatives to drive growth.
Fiscal 2017 
Compared to Fiscal 2016 On
 a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentagepoints

ibution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable togrowth
 in the United States,  partially offset  by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed  to direct distribution  increased total Converse  revenues byapproximately
 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having aninsignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America.

Overview
As
 a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchangerates.
 Our  primary  foreign  currency  exposures  arise  from  the  recording  of  transactions  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies  and  the  translation  of  foreign  currencydenominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.
Our
 foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations,financial
 position  and  cash  flows.  We  manage  global  foreign  exchange  risk  centrally  on  a  portfolio  basis  to  address  those  risks  material  to  NIKE,  Inc.  We  manage  theseexposures by
 taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remainingexposures
 using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”) and our foreigncurrency
 adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within ourportfolio
 of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposuresbeing
 hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; thelength of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for 
trading or speculative purposes.32

Table of ContentsRefer
 to Note  6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements foradditional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.
Transactional Exposures
We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:
•
Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctua tions in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.
Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: a.
Certain  NIKE  entities  purchase  product  from  the  NTC,  a  wholly-owned  sourcing  hub  that  buys  NIKE  branded  products  from  third-party  factories,predominantly
 in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functionalcurrencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.
b.
Other  NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for thoseNIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.
2.
Factory  input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreigncurrency
 risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.Under this program, our pay
ments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which thelabor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.
For
 the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting theproduct
 cost is recorded within Inventories and  is recognized in Cost  of sales when  the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices,excluding
 the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair valuethrough 
Other  expense  (income),  net .  Refer  to Note  16  —  Risk  Management  and  Derivatives in  the  accompanying  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements for additional detail.
As
 an offset  to the impacts  of the fluctuating  U.S. Dollar on our non-functional  currency denominated  product  purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S.
 Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakeningU.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.
•
Non-Functional  Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our EMEA geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operationsrevenues,
 are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency.These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.
•
Other  Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certaincases,
 the  Company  has  entered  into  contractual  agreements  which  have  payments  indexed  to  foreign  currencies  that  create  embedded  derivative  contractsrecorded at fair value through 
  Other expense (income), net . Refer to Note 16  — Risk Management and Derivatives in the  accompanying Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for additional detail.
•
Non-Functional  Currency  Denominated  Monetary  Assets  and  Liabilities  —  Our  global  subsidiaries  have  various  assets  and  liabilities,  primarily  receivables  andpayables,
 including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subjectto re-measurement which may create fluctuations in 
Other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. Managing Transactional Exposures
Transactional
 exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of naturaloffsets
 and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange ratefluctuations
 on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs describedabove. Generally, these are accounted for as cash
 flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product costexposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above.
Certain
 currency  forward  contracts  used  to  manage  the  foreign  exchange  exposure  of  non-functional  currency  denominated  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  subject  to  re-measurement
 and  embedded  derivative  contracts  are  not  formally  designated  as  hedging  instruments  under  U.S.  GAAP.  Accordingly,  changes  in  fair  value  of  theseinstruments
 are immediately recognized in Other  expense (income), net and  are intended to offset  the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement  of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.

Table of ContentsTranslational Exposures
Many
 of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results aswe
 are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreignsubsidiaries’
 non-U.S.  Dollar  denominated  balance  sheets  into  U.S.  Dollars  for  consolidated  reporting  results  in  a  cumulative  translation  adjustment  to Accumulated  othercomprehensive
 income within  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Shareholders’  Equity.  In  the  translation  of  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income,  a  weaker  U.S.  Dollar  inrelation
 to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchangerate fluctuations on
 the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a  benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years endedMay
 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income  before income taxes was  a benefit of approximately$177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Management generally identifies
 hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Beginning in fiscal 2019,we anticipate the functional cu
rrency of our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment will change from the local currency to U.S. Dollars as the subsidiary will beoperating
 in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, its non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities will now be subject to re-measurement and recorded inOther
 expense (income), net ,  within the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning in fiscal 2019. Although we continue to evaluate the impact, at current rates, we do notanticipate the re-measurement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
Managing Translational Exposures
To minimize the impact of translat
ing foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excesscash
 to  purchase  U.S.  Dollar  denominated  available-for-sale  investments.  The  variable  future  cash  flows  associated  with  the  purchase  and  subsequent  sale  of  theseU.S.
 Dollar  denominated  securities  at  non-U.S.  Dollar  functional  currency  subsidiaries  creates  a  foreign  currency  exposure  that  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting  under  theaccounting
 standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of theseU.S.
 Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year
 foreign  currency  translation  impact  on  net  earnings  in  the  period  the  investments  are  sold.  Hedges  of  available-for-sale  investments  are  accounted  for  as  cash  flowhedges.
We estimate the combination of
 translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency relatedgains
 and losses included in Other  expense (income), net had  an unfavorable impact of approximately $110 million and $59 million on our Income  before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries
We
 are  also  exposed  to  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  on  our  investments  in  wholly-owned  foreign  subsidiaries  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  theU.S.
 Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged andmay,
 in  the  future,  hedge  net  investment  positions  in  certain  foreign  subsidiaries  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  on  these  net  investments.  Thesehedges are
 accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018 and 2017. There were no cash flows from netinvestment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Activity
Cash
 provided by operations was $4,955 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $3,846 million for fiscal 2017 .  Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,473 million of
 operating cash flow for fiscal  2018 compared  to $4,781  million for fiscal 2017 .  The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of$1,482
 million for  fiscal 2018, compared to a decrease of $935  million for  fiscal 2017. Impacting  the change in working capital during fiscal 2018 was the accrual of $1,172million for
 the transition tax under the Tax Act, which will be paid in cash over an eight-year period. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act. Cash
 provided by operations  was  also impacted by the change  in Accounts  Receivable, net ,  which decreased $187  million ,  primarily due to improved collection timing,compared to an increase of 
$426 million in fiscal 2017. Cash
 provided (used) by investing activities was  an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018 ,  compared to an outflow of $1,008 million for fiscal 2017 ,  driven primarily by the netchange
 in short-term investments. During fiscal  2018 ,  the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $1,326  millioncompared to an inflow of 
$118 million in fiscal 2017 . In
 fiscal 2019, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Directstores. We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to
 4% of revenues, on average.Cash used
 by financing activities was $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2,148 million for fiscal 2017 .  The increase in Cash used  by financing activities was primarily driven by 
$1,482 million of  net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017, which did not recur in fiscal 2018. The increase in Cash used by financing activities was
 also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock, which resulted in a cash outflow of $4,254  million for  fiscal 2018 compared to an outflow of $3,223  million for fiscal 2017 
. In 
fiscal 2018 ,  we purchased 69.7  million shares  of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $4,267  million (an  average price of $ 61.25 per  share) under the four-year, $12 billionprogram
 approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2018, we had repurchased 149.4 million shares at  a cost of $8,704 million (an average price of $58.25 
per  share) under this program. Although the timing and number of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions, we currentlyanticipate
 completing this program during fiscal 2019. In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new four-year, $15 billion program to repurchase shares of NIKE’sClass
 B Common Stock, which we anticipate will commence at the completion of our current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come fromoperating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt.

On July 21, 2016, we
 filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelfexpires on July 21, 2019. For additional detail refer to 
Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On
 August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility maturesAugust

May 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. We
 currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings wereto
 decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee andinterest
 rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowingsunder
 the committed credit facility. Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount ofdebt secured by liens we may inc
ur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding underthis
 facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately dueand
 payable.  As  of May  31, 2018 ,  we  were  in  full  compliance  with  each  of  these  covenants  and  believe  it  is  unlikely  we  will  fail  to  meet  any  of  these  covenants  in  theforeseeable future.
Liquidity
 is  also  provided  by  our  $2  billion  commercial  paper  program.  During  the  year  ended May  31,  2018 ,  the  maximum  amount  of  commercial  paper  borrowingsoutstanding
 at any point was $1.4 billion. As of May  31, 2018 ,  there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercialpaper
 or other debt securities during fiscal 2019 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor’sCorporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively.
To
 date, in fiscal 2018, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, future volatility in the capital markets mayincrease costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.
As of 
May 31, 2018 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.2 billion , primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial
 paper,  corporate  notes,  U.S.  Treasury  obligations,  U.S.  government  sponsored  enterprise  obligations  and other investment  grade  fixed-income  securities.  Ourfixed-income
 investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securitieshave varying durations, as of 
May 31, 2018 , the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 33  days.We
 believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as describedabove, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issuesthat
 arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimatedprobability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.

Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. (2)
The  cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicablefixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of 
May 31, 2018 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. (3)
The  amounts  listed  for  endorsement  contracts  represent  approximate  amounts  of  base  compensation  and  minimum  guaranteed  royalty  fees  we  are  obligated  to  payathlete,
 public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contractsprovide
 for  bonuses  to  be  paid  to  the  endorsers  based  upon  athletic  achievements  and/or  royalties  on  product  sales  in  future  periods.  Actual  payments  under  somecontracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.
In
 addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on thisproduct
 on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to theendorsers
 will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regardingproduct and marketing initiatives. In
 addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of timeand are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.
(4)
We  generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internalorders
 from our NIKE Direct in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including openpurchase
 orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. In some cases, pricesare subject to change throughout the production process.
(5)
Other  purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts,made
 in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significantterms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.

Represents  a provisional estimate of the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries,which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we expect to
 utilize. Actual amounts could vary as we complete our analysis of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes inthe accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information.
In
 addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate whencash
 payments will occur. Refer to Note  9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for furtherinformation related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.
We
 also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May  31, 2018 .  Refer to Note  7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in  the accompanyingNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies
Our
 previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared inaccordance
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates andjudgments
 that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note  1 — Summary ofSignificant
 Accounting Policies in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in thepreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We
 believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, sowe
 consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit & FinanceCommittee of the Board of Directors.
These
 policies require we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual resultscould
 differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of anyreasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
Revenue Recognition
We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of
 sale. Title passes generally uponshipment
 or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of saleand digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.
In
 some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Ourrevenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.
In
 certain countries, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customerbased
 upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication these estimates have been materiallyinaccurate historically.
As
 part  of  our  revenue  recognition  policy,  we  record  estimated  sales  returns,  discounts  and  miscellaneous  claims  from  customers  as  reductions  to  revenues  at  the  timerevenues
 are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certaincustomers
 at  a  later  date.  We  base  our  estimates  on  (1)  historical  rates  of  product  returns,  discounts  and  claims,  (2)  specific  identification  of  outstanding  claims  andoutstanding
 returns  not  yet  received  from  customers  and  (3)  estimated  returns,  discounts  and  claims  expected  but  not  yet  finalized  with  our  customers.  Actual  returns,discounts
 and  claims  in  any  future  period  are  inherently  uncertain  and  thus  may  differ  from  our  estimates.  If  actual  or  expected  future  returns,  discounts  and  claims  aresignificantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
We make ongoing estimates re
lating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customersto
 make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness ofsignificant
 customers  based  on  ongoing  credit  evaluations.  Since  we  cannot  predict  future  changes  in  the  financial  stability  of  our  customers,  actual  future  losses  fromuncollectible
 accounts  may  differ  from  our  estimates.  If  the  financial  condition  of  our  customers  were  to  deteriorate,  resulting  in  their  inability  to  make  payments,  a  largerallowance
 might be required. In the event we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating  overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.
Inventory Reserves
We also make
 ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate thenet
 realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventoryand
 the  estimated  net  realizable  value.  This  reserve  is  recorded  as  a  charge  to Cost  of  sales .  If  changes  in  market  conditions  result  in  reductions  in  the  estimated  netrealizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. 
Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts
A
 significant amount of our Demand  creation expense relates  to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-linebasis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted 
for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain
 contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creationexpense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain
 contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining aspecified
 ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand  creation expense ratably  over the contract periodbased
 on our best estimate of the endorser’s performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in theendorser’s performance, adjustments to 
Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. 37

Table of ContentsCertain
 contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as
 the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteedamount
 of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed  payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand  creationexpense 
uniformly over the contract term. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Live
d AssetsWe
 review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of theassets
 might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset isused,
 a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset,
 among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset groupexceeds
 the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of theprimary
 asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset groupusing appropr
iate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between theasset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
Hedge Accounting for Derivatives
We
 use  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  certain  anticipated  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  transactions  as  well  as  certain  non-functional  currency  monetary  assets  andliabilities.
 When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows arerecorded
 in Accumulated  other comprehensive income ,  rather than Net  income ,  until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net  income .  In most cases, this results ingains
 and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other  comprehensive income into Net income sometime  after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria forthis
 accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature,our estimates of anticipated transa
ctions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transactionamounts
 decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additionaltwo-month
 period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income 
to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. Stock-based Compensation
We
 account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. TheBlack-Scholes
 option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in markettraded
 options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of activelytraded options
 on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change andwe
 use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future fromthat recorded in the current period.
Income Taxes
We
 are subject  to taxation  in the United States,  as well as various state  and foreign  jurisdictions.  The determination  of our provision  for income taxes requires significantjudgment,
 the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On  an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscalyear.
 This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income  before income taxes excluding  infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determinethe
 year-to-date Income  tax expense .  The  income  tax  effects  of  infrequent  or  unusual  items  are  recognized  in  the  interim  period  in  which  they  occur.  As  the  fiscal  yearprogresses, we
 continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in achange to our expected effective tax rate for the
 fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.We
 record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependenton
 future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxableincome.
 To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income  tax expense in the period when such determination is made.
On a
 quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions basedon factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled
 audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognitionof
 a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense 
. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the
 Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemedrepatriation
 of  undistributed  foreign  earnings,  a  reduction  in  the  corporate  tax  rate  from  35%  to  21%,  as  well  as  other  changes.  In  accordance  with  U.S.  Securities  andExchange Commission Staff
 Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), we recorded provisional amounts, which represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act forwhich
 the analysis is not yet complete. As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing and analyzing necessary information, performingand
 refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS), U.S. Treasury Department, Financial Accounting Standards Board(FASB)
 or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB118,
 the  Company’s  accounting  for  the  tax  effects  of  the  Tax  Act  will  be  completed  during  the  measurement  period,  which  should  not  extend  beyond  one  year  from  theenactment date.

Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 38

Table of ContentsOther Contingencies
In
 the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and avariety
 of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonablyestimable.
 Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions ofthird-party
 claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Iffuture
 adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period inwhich
 the  actual  loss  or  change  in  estimate  occurred.  In  addition  to  contingent  liabilities  recorded  for  probable  losses,  we  disclose  contingent  liabilities  when  there  is  areasonable
 possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do notbelieve
 any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position orcash flows.

Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur
es about Market RiskIn
 the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations inthe
 value  of  foreign  currencies  and  interest  rates.  It  is  our  policy  to  utilize  these  financial  instruments  only  where  necessary  to  finance  our  business  and  manage  suchexposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
We are
 exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk managementprogram is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctua
tions on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We useforward
 and  option  contracts  to  hedge  certain  anticipated,  but  not  yet  firmly  committed,  transactions  as  well  as  certain  firm  commitments  and  the  related  receivables  andpayables, inclu
ding third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in thenet
 assets  of  certain  international  subsidiaries  to  offset  foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  related  to  our  net  investment  in  those  subsidiaries.  Where  exposures  arehedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate
 movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The
 timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon thenature
 of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecastedtransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 
100% of the exposure by the time the  forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2018 
are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives 
in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our
 earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates.  Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact ofinterest rate
 changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, andfixed-rate debt of varying maturities.
Market Risk Measurement
We
 monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk
 (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts,  interest rate swaps,intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.
We
 use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximumpotential
 one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%confidence
 level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies andinterest
 rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over thepreceding
 one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potentialloss
 in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currencyrate
 fluctuations  on  the  derivative  instruments  only  and  does  not  include  the  impact  of  such  rate  fluctuations  on  non-functional  currency  transactions  (such  as  anticipatedtransactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.
The
 VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes inmarket rates. It also does not
 represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes ordifferences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
The
 estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $93 million and $97million
 at  May  31,  2018  and  2017,  respectively.  The  VAR  decreased  year-over-year  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  foreign  currency  volatilities  at  May  31,  2018.  Such  ahypothetical
 loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in thefair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $260 million and $161 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
The
 instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interestrate
 U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functionalcurrency
 intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.Therefore, we
 consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidatedfinancial position, results from operations and cash flows.
Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) -15(f)
 of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  Internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  thereliability
 of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UnitedStates
 of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only inaccordance
 with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect
 on the financial statements.While
 “reasonable assurance” is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reportingmay not
 prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two ormore
 people,  including  our  senior  management.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  becomeinadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
 Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of ourinternal control
 over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  — Integrated Framework (2013) issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ofthe
 Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as ofMay 31, 2018 
. PricewaterhouseCoopers
 LLP,  an  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  has  audited  (1)  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  (2)  the  effectiveness  of  ourinternal control over financial reporting as of 
May 31, 2018 , as stated in their report herein. Mark G. Parker

ial ReportingWe

 comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018, including the related notes and financialstatement schedule listed in the
 index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company ’ sinternal
 control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  May  31,  2018,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial  statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 
, and the results of their operations  and their cash  flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018 in  conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted
 in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,2018, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle
As
 discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based payment awards to employees as ofJune 1, 2017.
Basis for Opinions
The
 Company ’ s  management  is  responsible  for  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  and  for  itsassessment
 of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearingunder
 Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company ’ s internal control over financial reportingbased
 on our audits.  We are a public accounting  firm registered  with the Public Company Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States)  (“PCAOB”)  and are required to beindependent
 with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.
We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether
 the consolidated financial  statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reportingwas maintained in all material respects.
Our
 audits  of  the  consolidated financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated financial  statements,whether
 due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amountsand
 disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,as
 well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understandingof
 internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internalcontrol
 based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our auditsprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliabil
ity of financial reporting and the preparation offinancial
 statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes thosepolicies
 and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ofthe
 company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generallyaccepted accounting
 principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of thecompany;
 and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that couldhave a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness tofuture
 periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.

Basis of Consolidation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances havebeen eliminated.
On November 19,
 2015, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stockdividend
 payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price onDecember 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to 
fiscal 2018 presentation, includ ing reclassified geographic operating segment data to reflect the changes in theCompany’s operating structure, which became effective on June 1, 2017. Refer to 
Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information for additional information. During
 the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, management identified a misstatement related to the historical allocation of repurchases of Class B Common stock between Capital in excess
 of stated value and Retained earnings .  The Company assessed the materiality of these misstatements on prior period financial statements in accordance with U.S.Securities
 and  Exchange  Commission  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No.  99,  Materiality,  codified  in  ASC  250,  Presentation  of  Financial  Statements,  and  concluded  that  thesemisstatements
 were not material to any prior annual or interim period. As such, the Company has revised the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2017 , and hasreduced 
Capital  in excess of stated value by $2.9 billion and  increased Retained  earnings by  the same amount. Within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity,the Company has made corresponding revisions of 
$2.6 billion , $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion for the periods ended May 31, 2015, 2016 and, 2017, respectively. Revenue Recognition
Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and
 the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment orupon
 receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digitalcommerce
 revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Amounts collected from customers for sales or value added tax are recorded on a net basis. Provisions forpost-invoice
 sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice salesdiscounts
 consist  of  contractual  programs  with  certain  customers  or  discretionary  discounts  expected  to  be  granted  to  certain  customers  at  a  later  date.  Estimates  ofdiscretionary
 discounts,  returns  and claims are based on (1) historical  rates,  (2) specific  identification  of outstanding  claims and outstanding  returns  not yet received  fromcustomers
 and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017 ,  the Company’s reserve balances forpost-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were 
$675 million and $643 million , respectively. Cost of Sales
Cost
 of sales consists  primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedgegains and losses and product design costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in 
Cost of sales . Demand Creation Expense
Demand
 creation  expense consists  of  advertising  and  promotion  costs,  including  costs  of  endorsement  contracts,  complimentary  product,  television,  digital  and  printadvertising
 and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising mediacosts
 are  expensed  when  the  advertisement  appears.  Costs  related  to  brand  events  are  expensed  when  the  event  occurs.  Costs  related  to  retail  brand  presentation  areexpensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.
A
 significant  amount  of  the  Company’s  promotional  expenses  result  from  payments  under  endorsement  contracts.  In  general,  endorsement  payments  are  expensed  on  astraight-l
ine basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individualcontract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.
Certain
 contracts  provide  for  contingent  payments  to  endorsers  based  upon  specific  achievements  in  their  sports  (e.g.,  winning  a  championship).  The  Company  recordsDemand creation expense 
for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. 50

Table of ContentsCertain
 contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining aspecified
 ranking  in  a  sport  for  a  year).  When  the  Company  determines  payments  are  probable,  the  amounts  are  reported  in Demand  creation expense ratably  over  thecontract
 period  based  on  the  Company’s  best  estimate  of  the  endorser’s  performance.  In  these  instances,  to  the  extent  actual  payments  to  the  endorser  differ  from  theCompany’s estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, adjustments to 
Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain
 contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments inCost
 of sales as  the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts the Company estimates will not meetthe
 minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through salesof product in 
Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract period. Through
 cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses customers for certain costs of advertising the Company’s products. The Company records these costs inDemand creation expense 
at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs . This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run.Total
 advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as Demand  creation expense, were $3,577  million , $3,341 million and $3,278 million for  the yearsended 
May  31,  2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively.  Prepaid  advertising  and  promotion  expenses  totaled $730  million and $558  million at May  31,  2018 and 2017 , respectively,
 of  which $359  million and $311  million ,  respectively,  was  recorded  in Prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets ,  and $371  million and $247  million , respectively, was recorded in 
Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Operating Overhead Expense
Operating
 overhead expense consists  primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, as well as other administrative expenses, such asrent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, meetings and travel.
Cash and Equivalents
Cash
 and equivalents represent  cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity theypresent insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market 
funds, time depositsand corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term
 investments consist  of  highly  liquid  investments,  including  commercial  paper,  U.S.  Treasury,  U.S.  Agency,  time  deposits  and  corporate  debt  securities,  withmaturities
 over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2018 
and 2017 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At 
May 31, 2018 and 2017 , Short-term investments consisted  of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains andlosses
 reported, net of tax, in Accumulated  other comprehensive income ,  unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses onthe
 sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months,as
 available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assetswithin 
Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company’s short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable, net 
consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and
 maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, theCompany
 considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accountsreceivable
 with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets 
. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $30 million and $19 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Inventory Valuation
Inventories 
are  stated at lower of cost and net realizable value, and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, we ship productdirectly
 from our supplier to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of productcost from the Company’s suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and
 equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to40 
years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.Depreciation
 and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost  of sales .  Depreciation and amortization of all otherassets are recorded in 
Operating overhead expense . 51

Table of ContentsSoftware Development Costs
Internal
 Use Software :  Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 -year period on astraight-line
 basis. The Company’s policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal usecomputer
 software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computersoftware
 projects.  The  amount  of  capitalizable  payroll  costs  with  respect  to  these  employees  is  limited  to  the  time  directly  spent  on  such  projects.  Costs  associated  withpreliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.
Computer
 Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed :  Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of aproduct
 are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release tocustomers.
 In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurredsubsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The
 Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryingamount
 of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner inwhich
 an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observablemarket
 value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if thecarrying
 value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over theremaining
 economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Companywill
 estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairmentwould be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangi
ble AssetsThe
 Company  performs  annual  impairment  tests  on  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  lives  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year  or  when  events  occur  orcircumstances
 change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events orchanges
 in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reportingunit,
 planned divestitures or an expectation the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determinewhether
 it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Companydetermines
 it  is  more  likely  than  not  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  greater  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  two-step  impairment  test  is  unnecessary.  The  two-stepimpairment
 test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of thatreporting
 unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records animpairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.
Indefinite-l
ived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it ismore
 likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines it is more likely thannot that the
 indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is requiredfor
 these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner isrelieved
 of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, theappropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
Operating Leases
The
 Company  leases  retail  store  space,  certain  distribution  and  warehouse  facilities,  office  space,  equipment  and  other  non-real  estate  assets  under  operating  leases.Operating
 lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rentexpense
 for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning withthe effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the
 Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases alsoprovide
 for  contingent  rent,  which  is  generally  determined  as  a  percent  of  sales  in  excess  of  specified  levels.  A  contingent  rent  liability  is  recognized  together  with  thecorresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures certain
 financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price theCompany
 would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level
 hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the variousvaluation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).
52

Table of ContentsThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. •
Level  2: Inputs other than observable quoted prices for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities inactive markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the
 fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset orliability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Pricing vendors
 are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputswithout
 applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,volatilities
 and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricingcurves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.
Level 1 investments inclu
de U.S. Treasury securities. Assets and liabilities included within Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. Agency securities, money market funds, timedeposits,
 corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs and are an immaterialportion of our portfolio.
The Company’s fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactio
nsAdjustments
 resulting  from  translating  foreign  functional  currency  financial  statements  into  U.S.  Dollars  are  included  in  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment,  acomponent of 
Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders’ equity . The
 Company’s global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functionalcurrency.
 These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other  expense (income), net ,  within the Consolidated Statements ofIncome.
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities
The
 Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fairvalue
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated  other comprehensive income(a component of 
Total shareholders’ equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on  the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designatedas
 a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as thecash
 flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash  provided by operations component of the
 Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows.  For  designated  net  investment  hedges,  this  is  within  the Cash  used  by  investing  activities component  of  the  ConsolidatedStatements
 of Cash Flows. For the Company’s fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable tochanges
 in  interest  rates,  the  related  cash  flows  from  periodic  interest  payments  are  reflected  within  the Cash  provided  by  operations component  of  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Cash Flows. Refer to 
Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company’s risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation
The
 Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Planand
 employees’ purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value asCost of sales 
or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the  straight-line method.Refer to 
Note 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the Company’s stock-based compensation programs. Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expectedfuture
 tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance toreduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized.
The
 Company  recognizes  a  tax  benefit  from  uncertain  tax  positions  in  the  financial  statements  only  when  it  is  more  likely  than  not  the  position  will  be  sustained  uponexamination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in 
Income tax expense . Refer to 
Note 9 — Income Taxes for further discussion. 53

Table of ContentsEarnings Per Share
Basic
 earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings percommon share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.
Refer to 
Note 12 — Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating toassumptions
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reportedamounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In
 February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-02,  Income  Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassificationof
 Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income .  The standard allows for reclassification of stranded tax effects on items resulting from the Tax Cutsand
 Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) from  Accumulated  other comprehensive income  to   Retained earnings .  Tax effects unrelated to the Tax Act are released from  Accumulated other comprehensive income 
 using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the  underlying item.The
 Company early adopted the ASU in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result of the adoption,  Retained  earnings  decreased  by  $17  million ,  with a correspondingincrease
 to  Accumulated  other comprehensive income  due  to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Refer to  Note  9 — Income Taxes  for  additionalinformation on the impact of the Tax Act.
In
 March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation  — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which
 changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.The
 updated  guidance  requires  excess  tax  benefits  and  deficiencies  from  share-based  payment  awards  to  be  recorded  in  income  tax  expense  in  the  income  statement.Previously,
 excess tax benefits and deficiencies were recognized in shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. As a resultof
 the adoption, during fiscal 2018, the Company recognized  $230  million of  excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in  Income  tax expense  in  theConsolidated Statements of Income.
Additionally,
 ASU 2016-09 modified the classification of certain share-based payment activities within the statement of cash flows, which the Company applied retrospectively.As
 a result, for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, the Company reclassified cash inflows of  $177  million and $281 million ,  respectively, related to excess tax benefits from share-based
 payment awards, from  Cash  used by financing activities  to   Cash provided by operations ,  and reclassified cash outflows of  $29  million  and $22  million ,  for therespective
 periods, related to tax payments for the net settlement of share-based payment awards, from  Cash  provided by operations  to   Cash used by financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In
 August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,  Derivatives  and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities ,  which expands andrefines hedge
 accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items inthe financial statements,
 and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The updateto
 the standard is effective for the Company on June 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in any interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the updated guidance,but does not expect the adoption to have a
 material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In
 October  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-16, Income  Taxes  (Topic 740):  Intra-Entity  Transfers  of  Assets  Other  Than  Inventory .  The  updated  guidance  requirescompanies
 to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entitytransfers
 of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018, using a modifiedretrospective
 approach, with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of adoption. Upon adoption, the Company willrecord a
 cumulative effect adjustment reducing Retained earnings , Deferred income taxes and other assets , and Prepaid expenses  and other current assets by $507 million , $422 million 
and $45 million , respectively, and increasing Deferred income taxes and other liabilities by $40 million . In
 February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases  (Topic 842) ,  which replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard is intended to provideenhanced
 transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance willrequire the Company to
 continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. TheCompany will adopt the standard on June 1,
 2019. The ASU is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest period presented,with
 optional  practical  expedients.  The  Company  continues  to  assess  the  effect  the  guidance  will  have  on  its  existing  accounting  policies  and  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements
 and expects there will be an increase in assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at adoption due to the recording of right-of-use assets andcorresponding lease liabilities, which may be material. Refer to 
Note 15 — Commitments and Contingencies for information about the Company’s lease obligations. In
 January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial  Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and FinancialLiabilities 
.  The  updated  guidance  enhances  the  reporting  model  for  financial  instruments,  which  includes  amendments  to  address  aspects  of  recognition,  measurement,presentation
 and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a materialimpact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
54

Table of ContentsIn
 May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue  from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updatedguidance requi
res companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration towhich
 the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires reporting companies to disclose the nature, amount,timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018 using a modified retrospectiveapproach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of adoption.
While
 the Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s net Revenues in  the Consolidated Statements of Income,revenues
 for  certain  wholesale  transactions  and  substantially  all  digital  commerce  sales  will  be  recognized  upon  shipment  rather  than  upon  delivery  to  the  customer.Accordingly, the Company will record a cumulative effect adjustment increasing 
Retained earnings by approximately $23 million on June 1, 2018. Additionally,
 provisions  for  post-invoice  sales  discounts,  returns  and  miscellaneous  claims  will  be  recognized  as  accrued  liabilities  rather  than  as  reductions  to Accounts receivable,
 net ;  and the estimated cost of inventory associated with the provision for sales returns will be recorded within Prepaid  expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining provisions of the standard are not expected to have a material impact on the
 Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.NOTE 2 — Inventories

 Company elects to record the gross assets and liabilities of its derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s derivative financialinstruments
 are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amountsof
 cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company ’ s credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash  and equivalents and Accruedliabilities 
,  the latter of which would further offset against the Company’s derivative asset balance (refer to  Note  16 — Risk Management and Derivatives ).  Any amounts ofcash
 collateral posted related to these instruments associated with the Company ’ s credit-related contingent features are recorded in Prepaid  expenses and other currentassets 
,  which would further offset against the Company ’ s derivative liability balance (refer to  Note  16 — Risk Management and Derivatives ).  Cash collateral received orposted
 related to the Company ’ s credit related contingent features is presented in the Cash  provided by operations component  of the Consolidated Statements of CashFlows. Any amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant

 $2,392  $646  $863 On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the
 Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemedrepatriation
 of undistributed foreign earnings, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes. Under U.S. GAAP, accounting for the effect oftax
 legislation is required in the period of enactment. For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate, effective January 1, 2018, results in a blended U.S. federal statutoryrate
 for the Company of approximately 29% .  The Tax Act also includes provisions not yet effective for the Company, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxedincome (GILTI)
 of foreign subsidiaries, which will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accountingpolicy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.
A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the e
ffective income tax rate is as follows:

 55.3  % 13.2  % 18.7  %The
 effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2018 was  higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2017 primarily  due to the enactment of the Tax Act,which
 included provisional expense of $1,875  million for  the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and $158  million due  to theremeasurement
 of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impacton
 the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. Additionally, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax benefit from share-based compensation in the current period as a result of the
 adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, incometax
 benefits of $177 million and $281 million ,  respectively, attributable to employee share-based compensation were allocated to Total  shareholders’ equity. As  a result of theadoption of ASU 2016-09, beginning in fiscal 2018, income tax benefits from share-based compensation are reported in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. The
 effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2017 was 550 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2016 primarily  due to a one-timebenefit
 in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreignearnings taxed in the United States.
In
 accordance  with  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No.  118  (“SAB  118”),  the  provisional  amounts  recorded  represent  reasonableestimates
 of the effects of the Tax Act for which the analysis is not yet complete. As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing andanalyzing
 necessary information, performing and refining calculations  and obtaining additional guidance from the IRS, U.S. Treasury Department,  FASB or other standardsetting
 and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company’saccounting
 for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. At May 31,2018, there were no provisions for which the Company was unable to record a reasonable estimate of the impact.

Table of ContentsTransition Tax
During
 the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional expense of $2,010  million related  to the one-time transition  tax on the deemed repatriation  ofundistributed
 foreign earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as a result of further analysis of the provisions of the Tax Act and additional guidance, this provisionaltax
 expense decreased by $135  million .  The transition tax is based on the Company’s estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% forforeign
 cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The Company expects to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight -year period. Accordingly,
 the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $1,078 million ,  net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, hasbeen recorded in 
Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impact of Changes in the Tax Rate
As a
 result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they areexpected to be realized. The total provisional expense recorded during the period for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities was

The
 Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income  tax expense .  The liability for payment of interest and penalties decreased by $14 million 
during the year ended May 31, 2018 , decreased by $38 million during the year ended May 31, 2017 and increased by $45 million during the year ended May 31, 2016 . As of

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s  major  foreign  jurisdictions,  China  and  the  Netherlands,  have  concluded  substantially  all  income  tax  matters  through  calendar  2007  and  fiscal  2012,respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in 
the aggregate, along with the expiration ofapplicable
 statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $163 million within  the next 12months.
The
 Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside theUnited
 States. At May 31, 2017, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes had not been provided were approximately$12.2
 billion .  These undistributed foreign earnings were subject to the U.S. one-time mandatory transition tax and are eligible to be repatriated to the U.S. without additionalU.S.
 tax under the Tax Act. The Company has reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act and determined that any historical or future 
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested . A
 portion of the Company’s foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 .  This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions aremet
 or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was $126  million , $187 million and $173 million for  the fiscalyears ended 
May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.08 , $0.11 and $0.10 for the fiscal years ended 
May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Deferred
 tax assets at May  31, 2018 and 2017 were  reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a$13 million 
net  increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2018 ,  compared to a $30 million net increase  for the year ended May 31, 2017 and $43 millionnet increase for the year ended 
May 31, 2016 . The Company no longer has recorded deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carry-forwards; the 
$208 million recorded at May 31, 2017 was fully utilized to offset the impacts of transition tax.
The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of 
$289 million at May 31, 2018 . Such losses will expire as follows:

Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. As of 
May 31, 2018 and 2017 ,  the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $165 million and $152 million , respectively. These  letters of credit were generally issuedfor the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.
In
 connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage forlegal
 issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on theCompany’s
 historical  experience  and  the  estimated  probability  of  future  loss,  the  Company  has  determined  the  fair  value  of  such  indemnification  is  not  material  to  theCompany’s financial position or results of operations.
In
 the  ordinary  course  of  its  business,  the  Company  is  involved  in  various  legal  proceedings  involving  contractual  and  employment  relationships,  product  liability  claims,trademark
 rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe anycurrently
 identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position orcash flows.
NOTE 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives
The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect
 of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financialexposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
The
 Company  may  elect  to  designate  certain  derivatives  as  hedging  instruments  under  the  accounting  standards  for  derivatives  and  hedging.  The  Company  formallydocuments
 all  relationships  between  designated  hedging  instruments  and  hedged  items  as  well  as  its  risk  management  objectives  and  strategies  for  undertaking  hedgetransactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions.

All  interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly,changes
 in the fair values of the interest  rate swaps are considered  to exactly  offset  changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term  debt.  Refer to “Fair ValueHedges” in this note for additional detail.
Cash Flow Hedges
All changes in fair
 value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income  until  Net income 
 is  affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the samemanner
 as  the  underlying  exposure.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  these  contracts,  if  any,  is  recorded  immediately  in  earnings.  Derivativeinstruments
 designated as cash flow hedges must be discontinued when it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified timeperiod.
 The  gains  and  losses  associated  with  discontinued  derivative  instruments  in Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income will  be  recognized  immediately  in Other expense (income), net 
, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transacti on will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two -month periodthereafter.
 In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will account for the derivative as an undesignatedinstrument as discussed below.
The
 purpose of the Company ’ s foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company ’ sconsolidated
 results  of  operations,  financial  position  and  cash  flows.  Foreign  currency  exposures  the  Company  may  elect  to  hedge  in  this  manner  include  product  costexposures, non-functional
 currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.
Product
 cost  exposures  are  primarily  generated  through  non-functional  currency  denominated  product  purchases  and  the  foreign  currency  adjustment  program  describedbelow. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities 
purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub that
 buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product toNIKE
 entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2)Other
 NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with afunctional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
The
 Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assumingcertain
 of  the  factories’  foreign  currency  exposures,  some  of  which  are  natural  offsets  to  the  Company ’ s  existing  foreign  currency  exposures.  Under  this  program,  theCompany’s
 payments  to these factories  are adjusted for rate fluctuations  in the basket of currencies (“factory currency  exposure index”) in which the labor, materials andoverhead
 costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in thelocal or functiona
l currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollarand
 the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory’s acceptance of NIKE’s purchase order. Embedded derivativecontracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.
The
 Company’s policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed.Typically, the
 Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of
 the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The  total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $12.2 billion 
 as of May 31, 2018 . As of 
May 31, 2018 , $96 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and  matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified
 to Net  income during  the  next  12  months  concurrent  with  the  underlying  hedged  transactions  also  being  recorded  in Net  income .  Actual  amounts  ultimatelyreclassified to 
Net income are dependent on  the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2018 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 
24 months.Fair Value Hedges
The
 Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by theCompany
 to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet theshortcut
 method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value ofthe underlying long-term debt. 
The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017or 
2016 . The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2018.68

Table of ContentsNet Investment Hedges
The
 Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned internationaloperations.
 All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in Accumulated  other comprehensiveincome 
along  with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, arerecorded
 immediately in earnings. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended May  31, 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . The Companyhad 
no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018 . Undesignated Derivative Instruments
The Company may elect to enter into forei
gn exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/orthe
 embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with theircorresponding
 change in fair value recognized in Other  expense (income), net ,  together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/orembedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was  
$6.1 billion  as of  May 31, 2018 . Embedded Derivatives
As
 part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory’s acceptance of NIKE’s purchase order forcurrencies
 within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivativecontracts
 are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functionalcurrency
 of  either  substantial  party  to  the  contracts.  Embedded  derivative  contracts  are  treated  as  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  that  are  bifurcated  from  the  relatedpurchase
 order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other expense (income), net 
, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist. At 
May 31, 2018 , the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $260 million . Credit Risk
The Company is exposed to
 credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions aremajor financial
 institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company’s exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk islimited
 to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strictcounterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
The
 Company’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties’ creditworthiness andtheir
 ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company’s bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require theowing
 entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50  million should  the fair value of outstandingderivatives
 per counterparty be greater than $50  million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also triggercollateral requirements. As
 of  May 31, 2018 ,  the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had no derivative instruments with credit risk-related
 contingent features in a net liability position. Accordingly, the  Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2018 
,  the Company had received  $23 million  of cash  collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to  Note 6  — Fair Value Measurements ). The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be 
immaterial . NOTE 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information
The
 Company’s operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company’s internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions foroperations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each
 NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. InJune
 2017,  NIKE,  Inc.  announced  a new company  alignment  designed  to allow NIKE  to better  serve the  consumer  personally,  at scale.  As a result of this  organizationalrealignment,
 the Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & LatinAmerica,
 and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation. This includesreclassified
 operating segment data to reflect the changes in the Company’s operating structure, which became effective June 1, 2017. These changes had no impact onpreviously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows or sta
tements of shareholders’ equity.The
 Company’s NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, andoperates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.
Global
 Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarilyrepresents
 NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and designexpenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.
Corporate
 consists  largely  of  unallocated  general  and  administrative  expenses,  including  expenses  associated  with  centrally  managed  departments;  depreciation  andamortization
 related to the Company’s headquarters;  unallocated  insurance,  benefit  and compensation  programs, including stock-based  compensation;  and certain foreigncurrency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.
69

Table of ContentsThe
 primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as“EBIT”), which represents 
Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As
 part of the Company’s centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brandentity
 in the Company’s geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasonsto
 which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summerselling
 seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for  geographic operatingsegments
 and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity’s functional currency. Differences betweenassigned
 standard  foreign  currency  rates  and  actual  market  rates  are  included  in  Corporate,  together  with  foreign  currency  hedge  gains  and  losses  generated  from  theCompany’s centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.
Accounts
 receivable, net , Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for  operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and, therefore, are providedbelow. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures.

ants on Accountingand Financial Disclosure
There
 has  been  no  change  of  accountants  nor  any  disagreements  with  accountants  on  any  matter  of  accounting  principles  or  practices  or  financial  statement  disclosurerequired to be reported under this Item.
ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures
We
 maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized andreported
 within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC’s  rules  and  forms  and  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  ChiefExecutive Officer and Chief Financ
ial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls andprocedures,
 management  recognizes  any  controls  and  procedures,  no  matter  how  well  designed  and  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  thedesired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
We
 carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief FinancialOfficer,
 to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of 
May 31, 2018 . “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” is included in Item 8 of this Report.
We
 have continued  several transformation  initiatives  to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems.  These are long-term initiatives,  which we believe willenhance
 our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes. We will continue to monitor our internal controlover financial reporting for effectiveness throughout the transformation.
There
 have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonablylikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B. Other Information
On
 July 20, 2018, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. (the “Company”), approved a form of discretionary performanceaward
 agreement (the “DPA”) to enable the Company to award cash incentives  to employees in recognition  of Company and individual performance.  The form of DPA isintended to enhance the
 Company’s ability to pay for performance on a case-by-case basis by supplementing the Company’s existing performance-based compensation plans,including
 the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and the Executive Performance Sharing Plan. The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference tothe form of DPA, which is filed as Exhibit 10.22 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Additionally,
 on July 20, 2018, the Committee approved awards under the form of DPA to the Company’s continuing named executive officers (collectively, the “Officers”) asfollows: Mark G. Parker, $1,295,0
00; Andrew Campion, $277,500; Eric D. Sprunk, $277,500; Hilary K. Krane, $185,000; and John F. Slusher, $185,000. As further described inthe
 Company’s 2018 Proxy Statement, the Committee adjusted the payouts for LTIP awards covering the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period to primarily account for theimpact
 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because the terms of the LTIP awards, as applicable to the Company's named executive officers, did not contemplate the Tax Cuts andJobs Act, the Committee determined to award these one-time DPA grants so as to
 put the Officers in the same position as the non-executive officer LTIP participants.73

manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed by, consult for or be
connected in any manner

with, any business engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or sports equipment,sports electronics/technology and sports accessories business, or any other business that directly competes with
NIKE or any of its parent, subsidiaries or affiliated corporations (a "Competitor"). This provision is subject to NIKE's
option to waive all or any portion of the Restriction Period as more specifically provided below.
(b)
Extension of Time. In the event EMPLOYEE breaches this covenant not to compete, the Restriction Period shall automatically toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach
through private settlement, judicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon
the effective date of any such settlement, judicial or other resolution. NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE
the additional compensation described in paragraph 1.1 below during any period of time in which this Agreement is
tolled due to EMPLOYEE's breach. In the event EMPLOYEE receives such additional compensation after any such
breach, EMPLOYEE must immediately reimburse NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a
written request by NIKE.
(c)
Waiver of Non-Compete. NIKE has the option, in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the Restriction Period or to limit the definition of Competitor by giving EMPLOYEE seven (7) days' prior notice of such
election. In the event all or a portion of the Restriction Period is waived or the definition of Competitor is limited, NIKE
shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE for any period of time as to which the covenant not to compete has been
waived.
(d)
Additional Consideration. As additional consideration for the covenant not to compete described above, should NIKE terminate EMPLOYEE's employment without cause and elect to enforce the non-competition agreement, while
the Restriction Period is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary. Except where prohibited by law, if NIKE terminates EMPLOYEE for
"cause," no additional consideration will be owed to EMPLOYEE under this Agreement, and the covenant not to
compete will remain enforceable. For purposes of this Agreement only, "cause" shall mean (i) insubordination, (ii) acts
of dishonesty, (iii) involvement in illegal activities where such involvement in illegal activities violates NIKE policies,
places NIKE at risk or has or could damage NIKE's reputation in the community or any of its related or subsidiary
companies, (iv) violation of NIKE's anti-harassment or anti-discrimination policy or (v) gross neglect of EMPLOYEE'S
duties or willful misconduct that, in either case, results in economic harm to NIKE or harm to NIKE's reputation.
Nothing in this paragraph or Agreement alters the employment-at-will relationship between NIKE and EMPLOYEE.
If EMPLOYEE voluntarily terminates employment and NIKE elects to enforce the non-competition agreement, while
the Restriction Period is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to the greater of fifty percent
(50%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary or the equivalent of one-twelfth (1/12) of fifty percent of the median
family income for a four-person family in the state where EMPLOYEE resides, as determined by the U.S. Census
Bureau for the most recent year available at the time of EMPLOYEE's termination. The first payment to EMPLOYEE
of additional consideration shall follow on the last business day of the month after NIKE's election to enforce the non-
competition agreement. Subsequent payments during the Restriction Period shall be payable monthly on the last
business day of the month in accordance with NIKE's payroll practices.
(e)
Withholding and Offset. NIKE reserves the right to withhold from Additional Consideration payable to EMPLOYEE all federal, state and local taxes as shall be required, as well as any other amounts authorized or required by NIKE
policy. NIKE reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce the amount of Additional Consideration by
amounts that EMPLOYEE owes NIKE, including but not limited to any payments due to NIKE in accordance

with the NIKE Tax Equalization Policy if EMPLOYEE is employed as a transferee during his or her employment withNIKE. Employee agrees that notwithstanding the amount of any withholding and/or offset, even in an amount that
reduces payments of Additional Consideration to zero dollars ($0.00), the covenant not to compete will remain
enforceable. To the extent withholding or offset does not extinguish amounts that EMPLOYEE owes to NIKE,
EMPLOYEE remains obligated for the balance of the amounts owed.
2.
Subsequent Employer. EMPLOYEE agrees to notify NIKE at the time of separation of employment of the name of EMPLOYEE's new employer, if known. EMPLOYEE further agrees to disclose to NIKE the name of any subsequent
employer during the Restriction Period, wherever located and regardless of whether such employer is a competitor of
NIKE.
3.
Non-Disclosure Agreement (a)
Protected Information Defined. "Protected Information" shall mean all proprietary information, in whatever form and format, of NIKE and all information provided to NIKE by third parties that NIKE is obligated to keep confidential.
EMPLOYEE agrees that any and all information to which EMPLOYEE has access concerning NIKE projects and
internal NIKE information is Protected Information, whether in verbal form, machine-readable form, written or other
tangible form, and whether designated as confidential or unmarked. Without limiting the foregoing, Protected
Information includes trade secrets and competitively sensitive business or professional information (regardless of
whether such information constitutes a trade secret) relating to NIKE's research and development activities, its
intellectual property and the filing or pendency of patent applications, confidential techniques, methods, styles,
designs, design concepts and ideas, customer and vendor lists, contract factory lists, pricing information,
manufacturing plans, business and marketing plans or strategy, product development plans, product launch plans,
financial information, sales information, methods of operation, manufacturing processes and methods, products and
personnel information.
(b)
Excluded Information. Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), Protected Information excludes any information that is or becomes part of the public domain through no act or failure to act on the part of EMPLOYEE. Specifically,
EMPLOYEE shall be permitted to retain as part of his or her personal portfolio copies of EMPLOYEE's original
artwork and designs, provided EMPLOYEE presents those personal portfolio copies to his or her supervisor for review
and approval and provided the artwork or designs have become part of the public domain. In any dispute between the
parties with respect to this exclusion, the burden of proof will be on EMPLOYEE, and such proof will be by clear and
convincing evidence.
(c)
Employee's Obligations. During the period of employment by NIKE and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, EMPLOYEE will hold in confidence and protect all Protected Information and will not, at any time, directly or indirectly,
use any Protected Information for any purpose outside the scope of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE or disclose
any Protected Information to any third person or organization without the prior written consent of NIKE. Specifically,
but not by way of limitation, EMPLOYEE will not ever copy, transmit, reproduce, summarize, quote, publish or make
any commercial or other use whatsoever of any Protected Information without the prior written consent of NIKE.
EMPLOYEE will also take reasonable security precautions and such other actions as may be necessary to ensure
that there is no use or disclosure, intentional or inadvertent, of Protected Information in violation of this Agreement.
4.
Return of Protected Information. At the request of NIKE at any time, and in any event, upon termination of employment, EMPLOYEE shall immediately return to NIKE all Protected

Information in whatever form, including tapes, notebooks, drawings, digital files or other media containing ProtectedInformation, and all copies thereof, then in EMPLOYEE's possession or under EMPLOYEE's control.
5.
Unauthorized Use. During the period of employment with NIKE and thereafter, EMPLOYEE will notify NIKE immediately if EMPLOYEE becomes aware of the unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any Protected Information by any
person employed or not employed by NIKE at the time of such possession, use or knowledge. EMPLOYEE will cooperate
with NIKE in the investigation of any such incident and will cooperate with NIKE in any litigation with third parties deemed
necessary by NIKE to protect the Protected Information. NIKE shall provide reasonable reimbursement to EMPLOYEE
for each hour so engaged, and that amount shall not be diminished by operation of any payment under paragraph 1(d) of
this Agreement.
6.
Non-Solicitation/Non-Recruitment. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, EMPLOYEE will not directly or indirectly solicit, divert or hire away (or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away) to or for
himself or any other company or business organization any NIKE employee, whether or not such employee is a full-time
employee or temporary employee and whether or not such employment is pursuant to a written agreement or is at will or
any independent contractor working for NIKE.
7.
Accounting of Profits. EMPLOYEE agrees that, if EMPLOYEE should violate any term of this Agreement, NIKE shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, commissions, remuneration or benefits that
EMPLOYEE directly or indirectly has realized and/or may realize as a result of or in connection with any such violation
(including the return of any additional consideration paid by NIKE pursuant to paragraph 1(d) above). Such remedy shall
be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other rights or remedies to which NIKE may be entitled at
law or in equity.
8.
General Provisions. (a)
Survival. This Agreement shall continue in effect after the termination of EMPLOYEE's employment, regardless of the reason for termination.
(b)
Waiver. No waiver, amendment, modification or cancellation of any term or condition of this Agreement will be effective unless executed in writing by both parties. No written waiver will excuse the performance of any act other
than the act or acts specifically referred to therein.
(c)
Severability. Each provision herein will be treated as a separate and independent clause, and unenforceability of any one clause will in no way impact the enforceability of any other clause. Should any of the provisions in this Agreement
be found to be unreasonable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be enforceable to the
maximum extent enforceable by the law of that jurisdiction.
(d)
Applicable Law/Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder, shall be construed according to the laws of the state of Oregon. EMPLOYEE further hereby submits to the jurisdiction of, and agrees that
exclusive jurisdiction over and venue for, any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall lie
in the state and federal courts located in Oregon.
