PART I
Item 1—Business
Costco
 Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principallyengaged
 in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan,Korea,
 Australia,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  China,  and  through  a  majority-owned  subsidiary  in  Taiwan.  Costco  operated  795,  782,  and  762warehouses worldwide at Aug
ust 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websitesin the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on
 the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under thesymbol “COST.”
We
 report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first threequarters
 consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). Thematerial
 seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2020, 2019, and2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended Au
gust 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively.General
We
 operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded andprivate-label products in a wide range of
 categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operatingefficiencies
 achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities,these
 volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most otherretailers. We generally sell inventory before we are require
d to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.We
 buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points  (depots)  or  directly  to  ourwarehouses.
 Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freightvolume and handling efficie
ncies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.3

Table of ContentsOur
 average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economyand
 efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally bythe quality
 of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membershipformat, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well be
low those of typical retail operations.Our
 warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours ofoperation
 are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to thevolume
 of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing laborrequired.
 In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cashand checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, executive member 2% reward certificates an
d our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).Our
 strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere.We
 seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs)per
 warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 SKUsonline,
 some  of  which  are  also  available  in  our  warehouses.  Many  consumable  products  are  offered  for  sale  in  case,  carton,  or  multiple-packquantities only.
In
 keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical supp
ort services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage issold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise in the following categories:
•
Food  and  Sundries (including  dry  foods,  packaged  foods,  groceries,  snack  foods,  candy,  alcoholic  and  nonalcoholic  beverages,  andcleaning supplies)
•
Hardlines (including major appliances, el ectronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)•
Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) •
Softlines (including apparel and small appliances)•
Ancillary (including gasoline and phar macy businesses)Ancillary
 businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently.These
 businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouseswith
 gas stations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 615 gasstations at the end of 2020. Net sales for our gasoline busin
ess represented approximately 9% of total net sales in 2020.Our
 e-commerce  operations  allow  us  to  connect  with  our  members  online  and  provide  additional  products  and  services,  many  not  found  in  ourwarehouses.
 Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 6% of total net sales in 2020. This figure does not consider other services weoffer online in certain countries such as business d
elivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services.We
 have  direct  buying  relationships  with  many  producers  of  national  brand-name  merchandise.  We  do  not  obtain  a  significant  portion  ofmerchandise
 from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints including disruptions and delays that haveimpacted and could continue to impact the flow an
d availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternativesources.
 We  also  purchase  and  manufacture  private-label  merchandise,  as  long  as  quality  and  member  demand  are  high  and  the  value  to  ourmembers is significant.

Table of ContentsCertain
 financial  information  for  our  segments  and  geographic  areas  is  included  in Note  12 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  inItem 8 of this Report.
Membership
Our
 members  may  utilize  their  memberships  at  our  warehouses  worldwide.  Gold  Star  memberships  are  available  to  individuals;  Businessmemberships
 are  limited  to  businesses,  including  individuals  with  a  business  license,  retail  sales  license  or  comparable  document.  Businessmembers
 may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Ourannual
 fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a freehousehold card.
Our
 member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% on a worldwide basis at the end of 2020. The majority of members renewwithin
 six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteenmonths prior to the reporting date.
Our membership counts include active memberships as well as membersh
ips that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.At
 the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in theaddition
 to the count of approximately 2.0 million total cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members. The change did not impact2019
 or  2018.  Membership  fee  income  and  the  renewal  rate  calculations  were  not  affected.  Our  membership  was  made  up  of  the  following  (inthousands):
2020
2019 2018 Gold Star
46,800 42,900 40,700 Business, including affiliates
11,300 11,000 10,900 Total paid members
58,100 53,900 51,600 Household cards
47,400 44,600 42,700     Total cardholders
105,500 98,500 94,300 Paid
 cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $60.Executive
 memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executivemembers
 earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), which can be redeemed only at Costcowarehouses.
 This program also offers (except in Mexico, Japan, and Korea), access to additional savings and benefits on various business andconsumer
 services,  such  as  auto  and  home  insurance,  the  Costco  auto  purchase  program,  and  check  printing.  These  services  are  generallyprovided
 by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who totaled 22.6 million and represented 39% of paid members at theend of 2020, generally shop more frequently an
d spend more than other members.Labor
Our employee count was as follows:
2020
2019 2018 Full-time employees
156,000 149,000 143,000 Part-time employees
117,000 105,000 102,000 Total employees
273,000 254,000 245,000 Approximately 17,100 employees are un
ion employees. We consider our employee relations to be very good.5

Table of ContentsCompetition
Our
 industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy,and
 customer  service.  We  compete  on  a  worldwide  basis  with  global,  national,  and  regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,supercenters,
 internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  department  and  specialty  stores,  and  operators  selling  a  single  category  ornarrow
 range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We alsocompete
 with other warehouse clubs (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas in theU.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple cl
ubs.Intellectual Property
We
 believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names andsimilar
 intellectual  property  add  significant  value  to  our  business  and  are  important  to  our  success.  We  have  invested  significantly  in  thedevelopment
 and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale® trademarks  and  our  private-label  brand,  KirklandSignature
®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and helplower
 costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration ofour private-label items.
We
 rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employeesand
 others  to  protect  our  intellectual  property.  The availability  and duration  of  trademark  registrations  vary  by country;  however,  trademarks  aregenerally valid and may be renew
ed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.Available Information

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors
The
 risks  described  below  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  could  also  beaffected by
 additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us orthat
 we currently  consider to be immaterial.  These Risk Factors  should be carefully  reviewed in conjunction with Management' s Discussion andAnalysis
 of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item  7 and  our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item  8 of  thisReport.
Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our
 financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 83% of net salesand operating income in 2020, respectiv
ely. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 29% of U.S. netsales
 in 2020. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets.Any
 substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines infinancial
 performance  of  our  U.S.  operations,  particularly  in  California,  and  our  Canadian  operations  could  arise  from,  among  other  things:  slowgrowth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparabl
e sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcareand
 energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix towardlower
 gross  margin  products;  changes  or  uncertainties  in  economic  conditions  in  our  markets,  including  higher  levels  of  unemployment  anddepressed home values; and failin
g to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.We
 may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, andintegrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
 growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailersand businesses for
 suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots,as well as local community actions oppose
d to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting ouroperations
 and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasingand
 operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition,certain
 jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain largeretailers
 and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build orlease and operate new wareho
uses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.We
 seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  overall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existingwarehouses and adversely affect their comparable sa
les performance, member traffic, and profitability.We intend
 to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity withus,
 attracting  members  of  other  wholesale  club  operators,  our  lesser  familiarity  with  local  member  preferences,  and  seasonal  differences  in  themarket.
 Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established marketpresence.
 We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and, as a result, future profitability could bedelayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.
8

Table of ContentsWe
 have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains. Theeffectiveness
 of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desiredrates of return.
Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition
 could adversely affect our results of operations.Membership
 loyalty  and  growth  are  essential  to  our  business.  The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our  membership  base,  increase  thepenetration
 of Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation maynegatively
 impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue,negatively impacting our results of operations.
We
 sell  many  products  under  our  Kirkland  Signature  brand.  Maintaining  consistent  product  quality,  competitive  pricing,  and  availability  of  theseproducts
 is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also  generally  carry  higher  margins  than  national  brandproducts
 and  represent  a  growing  portion  of  our  overall  sales.  If  the  Kirkland  Signature  brand  experiences  a  loss  of  member  acceptance  orconfidence, our sales and gross margin results could b
e adversely affected.Disruptions
 in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales andmember satisfaction.
We
 depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our  depots.  We  also  rely  uponprocessing,
 packaging,  manufacturing  and  other  facilities  to  support  our  business,  which  includes  the  production  of  certain  private-label  items.Although
 we  believe  that  our  operations  are  efficient,  disruptions  due  to  fires,  tornadoes,  hurricanes,  earthquakes,  pandemics  or  other  extremeweather
 conditions  or  catastrophic  events,  labor  issues  or  other  shipping  problems  may  result  in  delays  in  the  production  and  delivery  ofmerchandise
 to  our  warehouses,  which  could  adversely  affect  sales  and  the  satisfaction  of  our  members.  Our  e-commerce  business  dependsheavily
 on third-party logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timelyfashion.
We
 may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members,the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It
 is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on ourability
 to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changingconsumer
 tastes,  preferences  (including  those  relating  to  sustainability  of  product  sources  and  animal  welfare)  and  spending  patterns  couldnegatively
 affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful atpredicting
 our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, orwe
 may  experience  out-of-stock  positions  and  delivery  delays,  which  could  result  in  higher  costs,  both  of  which  would  reduce  our  operatingperformance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and o
perating income.Availability and perfor
mance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital for our business to operate efficiently. Failure to executecomplex IT projects, and have these IT systems available to our business will adversely impact our operations.
IT
 systems play a crucial role in conducting our business on a daily basis. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions,conduct payment transactions, track
 and value our inventory and produce reports which are critical for making business decisions on a daily, weeklyand periodic basis. Failure or disruption of these
 IT systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products from our suppliers, producegoods
 in  our  manufacturing  plants,  move  the  products  in  an  efficient  manner  to  our  warehouses  and  sell  products  to  our  members.  We  areundertaking large technology a

 impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digitalresiliency
 for our business-critical systems to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures,computer
 viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes tornadoes andhurricanes.
 Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources torestore
 IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost of movingmerchandise
 and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making significant investments in enhancing our digital resiliency andfailure or
 delay in execution of these projects could delay our ability to be resilient to disruptive events. Failure to deliver our IT transformation effortsefficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive pos
ition and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We
 are  required  to  maintain  the  privacy  and  security  of  personal  and  business  information  amidst  evolving  threat  landscapes  and  incompliance
 with  emerging  privacy  and  data  protection  regulations  globally.  Failure  to  meet  the  requirements  could  damage  ourreputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.
Increased
 IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon ITsystems and
 networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect, storeand
 process  sensitive  information  relating  to  our  business,  members,  suppliers  and  employees.  Operating  these  IT  systems  and  networks,  andprocessing
 and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. The increased use of remote workinfrastructure
 due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  increased  the  possible  attack  surfaces.  Security  threats  designed  to  gain  unauthorizedaccess
 to our systems, networks and data, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attemptsto
 coordinated  and  targeted  attacks,  including  sophisticated  computer  crimes  and  advanced  persistent  threats.  These  threats  pose  a  risk  to  thesecurity of
 our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and networks, orthose
 managed  by  third  parties  such  as  cloud  providers,  could  have  vulnerabilities,  which  could  go  unnoticed  for  a  period  of  time.  While  ourcybersecurity
 and compliance posture seeks to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-partyservice providers have implemented and are impl
ementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.The
 potential impacts of a future material cybersecurity attack includes reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties,disruption
 to  systems,  unauthorized  release  of  confidential  or  otherwise  protected  information,  corruption  of  data,  diminution  in  the  value  of  ourinvestment
 in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results ofoperations
 and financial condition and loss of member confidence. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate tocover
 claims  or  liabilities  relating  to  a  cybersecurity  attack.  In  addition,  data  we  collect,  store  and  process  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  andinternational
 laws  and  regulations,  such  as  the  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation,  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act,  HealthInsurance
 Portability and Accountability Act, China cybersecurity law and other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various statesand around the globe, which may carry significa
nt potential penalties for noncompliance.We are subject to payment-related risks.
We
 accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, executivemember
 2%  reward  certificates,  and  our  shop  card.  As  we  offer  new  payment  options  to  our  members,  we  may  be  subject  to  additional  rules,regulations,
 compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptancefees, along with additional transactio
n processing fees. We rely on third parties to10

 payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties becomeunwill
ing or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, includingdata
 security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card IndustryData
 Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronicstorage,
 processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for cardre-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and l
ose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business andoperating results could be adversely affected.
We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputat
ion, and expose us to litigation.If
 our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children' s products, pet products and durable goods,do
 not meet  or are perceived  not to meet  applicable safety standards  or our members'  expectations  regarding  safety,  we could experience  lostsales,
 increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses orinjuries
 could  result  from  tampering  by  unauthorized  third  parties,  product  contamination  or  spoilage,  including  the  presence  of  foreign  objects,substances,
 chemicals,  other  agents,  or  residues  introduced  during  the  growing,  manufacturing,  storage,  handling and transportation  phases,  orfaulty
 design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure thatthe products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subj
ect to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply inall
 material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injuryor
 that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and otherliabilities
 that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued,negative
 publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effectscould be long-term.
If
 we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could beadversely impacted.
Omnichannel
 retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors.Our
 members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media,particularly
 in the wake of COVID-19. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, ordevelop relevant member-facing technolo
gy in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.Inability
 to attract,  train  and  retain  highly  qualified  employees  could  adversely  impact  our business,  financial  condition  and results  ofoperations.
Our
 success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations, IT,merchandising
 and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impactour
 business.  We  must  attract,  train  and  retain  a  large  and  growing  number  of  qualified  employees,  while  controlling  related  labor  costs  andmaintaining
 our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatorychanges,
 prevailing  wage  rates,  and  healthcare  and  other  insurance  costs.  We  compete  with  other  retail  and  non-retail  businesses  for  theseemployees
 and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highlyqualified employees in the future, which co
uld have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.11

Table of ContentsWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.
Claims
 for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability,inventory
 loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limitexposures
 arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect torisk
 retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs tomaintain
 our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and resultsof operations.
Although we maintain specific covera
ges for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result ofany
 physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, andbusiness interruption. Such losses coul
d materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.Market and Other External Risks
We
 face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations.
The
 retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with awide
 range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club
 operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operatorsselling
 a single category or narrow  range of merchandise.  Such retailers  and warehouse club operators  compete  in a variety  of ways,  includingpricing,
 selection  and  availability,  services,  location,  convenience,  store  hours,  and  the  attractiveness  and  ease  of  use  of  websites  and  mobileapplications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved
 the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhancedcompetition.
 Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater marketpenetration
 than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and customer expectations couldresult in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.
General
 economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  ofoperations.
Higher
 energy  and  gasoline  costs,  inflation,  levels  of  unemployment,  healthcare  costs,  consumer  debt  levels,  foreign-currency  exchange  rates,unsettled
 financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related togovernment
 fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and otherhealth
 crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impactthe cost of or
 ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have raised the cost ofmany
 items  and  created  uncertainty  with  respect  to  tariff  impacts  on  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  isdependent
 on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales andgross
 margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors.While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could h
ave an adverse impact on our financial results.Prices of
 certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historicallyvolatile
 and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  labor  costs,  competition,  marketspeculation, government regulations, taxes an
d periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and12

Table of Contentsour
 ability  and  desire  to  pass  them  through  to  our  members  may  affect  our  sales  and  profit  margins.  These  factors  could  also  increase  ourmerchandise
 costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. Generaleconomic conditions can also be affected by ev
ents like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism.Suppliers
 may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards,resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We
 depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continueto
 grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change theterms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selli
ng to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits.We buy
 from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or theloss
 of  key  suppliers  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able to  develop  relationships  with  new  suppliers,  and  products  from  alternativesources,
 if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supplymay be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consiste
ntly available.Our
 suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,financial
 liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and politicalconditio
ns that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our qualitycontrol,
 legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to usand
 might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damageour reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise a
dversely impact our business.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During
 2020,  our  international  operations,  including  Canada,  generated  27%  and  33%  of  our  net  sales  and  operating  income,  respectively.  Ourinternational
 operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare ourconsolidated
 financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars usingcurrent
 exchange  rates.  Future  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  that  are  unfavorable  to  us  may  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  ourCanadian
 and  Other  International  operations  and  have  a  corresponding  adverse  period-over-period  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  As  wecontinue to expand internationa
lly, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.A
 portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currencyfluctuations
 may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates mayadversely affect our results of operations.
Natural
 disasters,  extreme  weather  conditions,  public  health  emergencies  or  other  catastrophic  events  could  negatively  affect  ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural
 disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes; acts of terrorism or violence, including activeshooter
 situations; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralizedoperating
 systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events couldresult in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary
closure of warehouses,
13

Table of Contentsdepots,
 manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term
 disruption  in  the  supply  of  products  from  some  local  or  overseas  suppliers,  the  temporary  disruption  in  the  transport  of  goods  to  or  fromoverseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our wareho
uses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses.Public
 health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or havean
 adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult orimpossible
 to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition a
nd results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects.
The
 continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile, and are affecting certain business operations, demand forour products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, avail
ability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability topredict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financia
l performance, among other things.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in
 widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our employees, members, suppliers andother
 people and entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue tospread
 and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place ordersand
 business and government shutdowns. We are taking precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees,including
 temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely. To reward our employees for exemplary service in difficult times we temporarilyincreased
 compensation levels and otherwise incurred increased spending for wages and benefits, including overtime pay. The pandemic and anypreventati
ve or protective actions that governments or we may take are likely to result in a period of business disruption, reduced member traffic andreduced sales in certain merchandise categ
ories, and increased operating expenses.The pandemic has significant
ly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay.These
 disruptions and delays have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, which have affected and could continue to negativelyaffect
 the flow or availability of certain products. Member demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed andmember
 behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factorshave
 resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products. Even if we are able to find alternatesources for
 certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, adversely impacting our profitability and financialcondition.
 Similarly,  increased  demand  for  online  purchases  of  products  has  impacted  our  fulfillment  operations,  resulting  in  delays  in  deliveringproducts to members.
If
 we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if our members do not participate in social distancing and other safety measures, the well-being
 of our employees and members could be at risk, and a failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, couldcause
 reputational  harm  to  our  brand  and  subject  us  to  lost  sales  and  claims  from  employees,  members,  suppliers,  regulators  or  other  parties.Additionally,
 a future outbreak of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our facilities could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facilityclosures,
 which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. Some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand theavailab
ility of workers compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase ourexposure to claims and increase our costs.

 an effort to strengthen our liquidity position, during the year we issued $4,000 million Senior Notes, a portion of which was used to repay, prior tomaturity,
 $1,500 million of our 2.150% and 2.250% Senior Notes. Financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experiencesignificant
 volatility and turmoil. Our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debtcapital
 markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. If the impacts of the pandemic continue to disrupt the financialmarkets,
 or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and otherterms for new debt or other sources of external liquidity, if needed.
Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
•
The severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there is a “second wave” caused by additional periods of increases or spikesin the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate;
•
Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;•
Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resourcesto the pandemic response;
•
The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and•
The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors.To
 the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financialconditio
n, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations,competition,
 brand reputation,  implementation  of strategic  initiatives,  cybersecurity  threats,  payment-related  risks,  technology systems  disruption,supply chain disruptions, labor ava
ilability and cost, litigation, operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and regulatory requirements.Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We
 use  natural  gas,  diesel  fuel,  gasoline,  and  electricity  in  our  distribution  and  warehouse  operations.  Government  regulations  limiting  carbondioxide
 and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs couldmaterially affect our profitability. Climate change, extreme
 weather conditions, and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities atcosts and
 in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concernsabout climate change and which face i
ncreased regulation.Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We
 believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay inmeeting
 these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new membersign-ups,
 gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the marketprice of our stock to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
We
 are  subject  to  risks  associated  with  the  legislative,  judicial,  accounting,  regulatory,  political  and  economic  factors  specific  to  thecountries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
At
 the  end  of  2020,  we  operated  243  warehouses  outside  of  the  U.S.,  and  we  plan  to  continue  expanding  our  international  operations.  Futureoperating
 results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which arebeyond our control.
15

Table of ContentsThese
 factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the withdrawal of theU.K. from
 the European Union, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that mayimpact internationa
l operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulationsof
 the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which havebeen
 historically  less  stable  than  the  U.S.  Risks  inherent  in  international  operations  also  include,  among  others,  the  costs  and  difficulties  ofmanaging international op
erations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Section
 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reportingand
 disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls andprocedure
s, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periodscould
 be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and otherexpenses, negatively affect investor confidence i
n our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.Changes
 in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accountingmatters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting
 principles  and  related  pronouncements,  implementation  guidelines,  and  interpretations  we  apply  to  a  wide  range  of  matters  that  arerelevant
 to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by ourmanagement.
 Changes  in  rules  or  interpretation  or  changes  in  underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  our  management  couldsignificantly change our reported or expected fin
ancial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.We could be subject to additional tax liabilities.
We
 are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at anypoint
 in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognizeadditional
 tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax  liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,  administrativepractices,
 principles,  assessments  by  authorities  and  interpretations  related  to  tax,  including  tax  rules  in  various  jurisdictions.  We  compute  ourincome
 tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earningsattributable to the various jurisdictions in whic
h we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes inthe
 enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.
Significant
 changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials,hazardous
 and  non-hazardous  wastes  and  other  environmental  matters  could  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition  andresults of operations.
We
 are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,storage,
 discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to complywith
 these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation orcompensatory
 requirements,  or  the  imposition  of  severe  penalties  or  restrictions  on  operations  by  governmental  agencies  or  courts  that  couldadversely affect our business, financial conditi
on and results of operations.16

 at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use andmaintenance
 of  refrigeration  systems,  including  ammonia-based  chillers,  noise,  odor  and  dust  management,  the  operation  of  mechanizedprocessin
g equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with currentand
 future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our employees, andclaims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuri
es, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities.We
 are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
Our
 business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  otherproceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines,
 penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedingsand
 audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws,and
 other  litigation.  We  cannot  predict  with  certainty  the  outcomes  of  these  proceedings  and  other  contingencies,  including  environmentalremediation
 and  other  proceedings  commenced  by  governmental  authorities.  The  outcome  of  some  of  these  proceedings,  audits,  unclaimedproperty
 laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or couldrequire
 us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending againstthese lawsuits and proceedings may inv
olve significant expense and diversion of management' s attention and resources.Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments

 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (amounts  in millions, except per share,share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)
Overview
We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comp
arable sales growth. Net sales includes our coremerchandi
se categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparablesales as net
 sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commercewebsites
 operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existingmembers and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenc
ed by certain factors that arebeyond
 our control:  fluctuations  in currency  exchange rates (with  respect to the consolidation of the results of our international  operations);  andchanges
 in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions  (primarily  impacting  our  U.S.  and  Canadian  operations).  The  higher  ourcomparable
 sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducingthem
 as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to ourmembers
 the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantialfactor
 in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the UnitedStates. Net
 sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global,national
 and regional wholesalers and retailers,  including those with e-commerce  operations.  While we cannot control or reliably predict generaleconomic health or changes in competition, we
 believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such asthrough adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, incl
uding increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.Our
 philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizingprices
 charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  on  quality  goods  –consistently
 providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drivesales
 or  meet  competition  and  holding  prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on  to  our  members,  all  negativelyimpacting
 gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generallyhas a lower
 gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared toour
 non-gasoline  business.  A  higher  penetration  of  gasoline  sales  will  generally  lower  our  gross  margin  percentage.  Rapidly  changing  gasolineprices
 may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the highersales
 base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasolineprices
 has  the  inverse  effect.  Additionally,  actions  in  various  countries,  particularly  China  and  the  United  States,  have  created  uncertainty  withrespect to
 how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type ofgoods,
 rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising andpricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these pote
ntial impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.We
 also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficultto
 secure,  and  square  footage  growth  becomes  a  comparatively  less  substantial  component  of  growth.  The  negative  aspects  of  such  growth,however,
 including  lower  initial  operating  profitability  relative  to  existing  warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  whenopenin
gs occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operatingfloor space square footage growth is generally h
igher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to21

Table of Contentscontinue.
 Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross marginpercentage relative to our warehouse busi
ness.The
 membership  format  is  an  integral  part  of  our  business  and  has  a  significant  effect  on  our  profitability.  This  format  is  designed  to  reinforcemember loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The
 extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of ourExecutive
 members,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially  influences  our  profitability.  Our  paid  membership  growth  rate  may  be  adverselyimpacted when warehouse ope
nings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.Our
 financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significantcosts
 are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With  respect  to  the  compensation  of  our  employees,  ourphilosophy
 is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employeeturnover
 and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of ourworkforce.
 This  may  cause  us,  for  example,  to  absorb  costs  that  other  employers  might  seek  to  pass  through  to  their  workforces.  Because  ourbusiness
 operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costsand selling, general and a
dministrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our
 operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 12  to  the consolidatedfinancial
 statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of squarefootage growth,
 lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, and may lackan e-commerce business.
In
 discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which arereferences
 to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from localcurrencies
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the differencebetween the current period's currency exchange rates an
d that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net salesis calculated based on the difference betw
een the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our
 fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2020, 2019, and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 30,2020, September 1, 2019, and

We opened 16 new warehouses, including 3 relocations: 9 new in the U.S., 3 new in our Other International segment, and 1 net new location inour Canadian segment, compared to 25 new ware
houses, including 5 relocations in 2019;•
Net sales increased 9% to $163,220 driven by a 8% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2019 and 2020;•
Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $3,541, primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses;•
Gross margin percentage increased 18 basis points, driven primarily by certain core merchandise categories, partially offset by certain ancillaryand other businesses, which were neg
atively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions;•
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales and partial reversal of aprevious year tax assessment. These benefits were partially offset by incremental wa

On
 March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 infections had become a pandemic, and shortly afterward the U.S.declared
 a National Emergency. The outbreak has led to widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and is affecting many aspectsof
 our business and the operations of others with which we do business. In our response to the pandemic and in an effort to protect our membersand
 employees, we have taken several measures, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors, and their implications on our results of operations haveimpacted
 us across all our reportable segments to varying degrees. Throughout the pandemic our warehouses have largely remained open as aresult
 of being deemed an “essential business” in most markets and resulted in strong sales increases in our food and sundries and fresh foodsmerchandise
 categories compared to pre-pandemic time periods. This growth in certain of our core business categories has led to improved grossmargin
 and SG&A percentages as we leveraged these sales to achieve greater efficiency. Our e-commerce business has also benefited, as moremembers
 have shopped online during the pandemic. Conversely, we have experienced decreases in both the sales and profitability of many of ourancillary
 and other businesses due to temporary closures or limited demand. Additionally, we paid $564 in incremental wage and sanitation costsduring 2020 related 
to COVID-19.23

Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the year ended September 1, 2019. Net Sales
Net sales increased $13,869 or 9%
 during 2020, primarily due to an 8% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2019and
 2020. During the second half of 2020, we experienced a significant sales shift from certain of our ancillary and other businesses to our coremerchandise
 categories, primarily food and sundries and fresh foods, as a result of COVID-19. This shift was largely driven by price deflation andlower
 volume in our gasoline business; temporary closures of most of our optical, hearing aid and photo departments; limited service in our foodcourts; and minimal demand in our travel business.
Changes
 in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $1,504, or 101 basis points, compared to 2019, due to a 10% decrease in the averageprice
 per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 4%, negatively impacting net sales by $699, or 47 basis points. Changes inforeign currencies relative to the
 U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $663, or 44 basis points, compared to 2019, attributableto our Canadian and Other International Operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable
 sales increased 8% during 2020 and were positively impacted by increases in average ticket. While traffic increased slightly in 2020, itdecreased
 in the second half of the year due to capacity restrictions and regulations related to COVID-19. There was an increase of 50% in e-commerce comparable sales in 2020, with an increas
e of 80% in the second half of the year.24

 gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage ofcore merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 16 basis points, primarily due to increases in fresh foods and softlines, partially offset
by a decrease in hardlines. This measure elimi
nates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary andother
 businesses. Fresh foods gross margin increased as a result of efficiencies from increased sales, partially offset by operating losses from ourpoultry complex.
Total
 gross margin percentage increased 18 basis points compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, grossmargin
 percentage  was  11.10%,  an  increase  of  eight  basis  points.  This  increase  was  primarily  due  to  a  32  basis  point  increase  in  our  coremerchandise
 categories, predominantly fresh foods and food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines and hardlines. This increasewas
 also positively impacted by our co-branded credit card program, which included an adjustment in 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewardsearned.
 These increases were partially offset  by a decrease  of 14 basis points in our warehouse ancillary  and other  businesses, predominantlycertain
 ancillary businesses that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions. However, certain of our ancillary and otherbusiness
es, such as tire shop, gasoline and e-commerce businesses, did improve. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wageand
 sanitation  costs  related  to  COVID-19  of  six  basis  points,  a  reserve  for  certain  inventory  of  three  basis  points,  and  increased  spending  bymembers
 under  the  Executive  Membership  2%  reward  program  of  one  basis  point.  Changes  in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollarnegatively impacted gross margin by approximately $

 primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash andcash
 equivalents and short-term investments were $13,305 and $9,444 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of these balances, unsettledcredit
 and  debit  card  receivables  represented  approximately  $1,636  and  $1,434  at  the  end  of  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  These  receivablesgenerally

 believes  that  our  cash  position  and  operating  cash  flows  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  theforeseeable
 future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longerconsider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consoli
dated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net
 cash provided by operating activities totaled $8,861 in 2020, compared to $6,356 in 2019. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarilyderived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in op
erations generally consists of payments to our merchandise suppliers, warehouseoperating
 costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includespayments
 for  income  taxes.  Changes  in  our  net  investment  in  merchandise  inventories  (the  difference  between  merchandise  inventories  andaccounts payable) is impacted by several factors, includi
ng how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payablespaid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net
 cash used in investing activities totaled $3,891 in 2020, compared to $2,865 in 2019, and primarily related to capital expenditures. In 2020, weacquired Innovel
 and a minority interest in Navitus. For more information see Notes 1  and 2  to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes maturities and p
urchases of short-term investments.Capital Expenditures
Our
 primary  requirement  for  capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for  new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required forinformation
 systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In  2020, we spent $2,810 on capitalexpenditures,
 and it is our current intention to spend approximately  $3,000 to $3,200 during  fiscal 2021. These  expenditures are expected to befinanced
 with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 16  new warehouses,  includingthree relocations, in 2020, and plan to ope
n approximately 23 additional new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2021. We have experienceddelays in real estate and construction activities du
e to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans aresubject to change upon further review of our capital expe
nditure needs or based on the current economic environment.Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net
 cash used in financing activities totaled $1,147 in both 2020 and 2019. In April 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of SeniorNotes
 as  follows:  $1,250  of  1.375%  due  June  2027;  $1,750  of  1.600%  due  April  2030;  and  $1,000  of  1.750%  due  April  2032.  A  portion  of  theproceeds
 was  used  to  repay,  prior  to  maturity,  the  outstanding  $1,000  and  $500  principal  balances  on  the  2.150%  and  2.250%  Senior  Notes,respectively,
 at  a  redemption  price  plus  accrued  interest  as  specified  in  the  Notes'  agreements.  The  remaining  funds  are  intended  for  generalcorporate purposes.
Financing
 activities  also  included  $1,200  and  $500  repayment  of  our  1.700%  and  1.750%  Senior  Notes,  respectively,  payment  of  dividends,withholding taxes on stock-based aw
ards, and repurchases of common stock.Stock Repurchase Programs
During
 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 643,000 and 1,097,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $308.45 and $225.16, respectively,totaling
 approximately  $198  and  $247,  respectively.  These  amounts  may  differ  from  the  stock  repurchase  balances  in  the  accompanyingconsoli
dated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time,
 as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares areretired, in accordance with the Washington
28

Table of ContentsBusiness Corporation Act. The remaining amou
nt available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,745 at the end of 2020.Dividends
Cash dividends declared in 2020 totaled $2.70 per share,
 as compared to $2.44 per share in 2019. Dividends totaling $1,479 were paid during 2020,of
 which $286 related to the dividend declared in August 2019. In April 2020, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from$0.65
 to $0.70 per share. In July 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.70 per share, which was paidon August 14, 2020.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We
 maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 30, 2020, we had borrowing capacity under thesefacilities
 of $967. Our international operations maintain $500 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $204 is guaranteedby the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings und
er the bank credit facilities at the end of 2020 and 2019.The
 Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $183. The outstanding commitments under thesefacilities
 at the end of 2020 totaled $166, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year.The
 bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. Theamount
 of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of creditoutstanding.

In
 the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current orfuture effect on our financial condition or financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requiresthat
 we  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  andliabilities
 at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  We  base  ourestimates
 on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates.For
 further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1  to  the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of thisReport.
Insurance/Self-insu
rance LiabilitiesClaims
 for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability,inventory loss,
 and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to seekto
 limit  exposures  arising  from  very  large  losses.  We  use  different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurancesubsidiary,
 and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated byusing
 historical  claims  experience,  demographic  factors,  severity  factors,  and  other  actuarial  assumptions.  The  costs  of  claims  are  highlyunpredictable
 and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time. Whilewe
 believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs coulddiffer significantly from recorded liabilities. Historical
ly, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See 
Note 1 to the  consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
(amounts in millions) Our
 exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  inspeculative or leveraged transactions or hol
d or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk
Our
 exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instrumentsconsidered
 to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1  to  the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term
 investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. Theprimary
 objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investmentsare in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair val
ue due to interest rate fluctuations.30

Table of ContentsOur
 policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized byU.S.
 government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances.Our
 wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  invests  in  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  obligations  and  U.S.  government  andgovernment
 agency  money  market  funds.  Our  Canadian  and  Other  International  subsidiaries’  investments  are  primarily  in  money  market  funds,bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of depos
it, generally denominated in local currencies.A
 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2020 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For thoseinvestments
 that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates arereflected within stockholders’ equity in accumu
lated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.The
 nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of2020, long-term
 debt with fixed interest rates was $7,657. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 5  to the consolidated financial statements inc
luded in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.Foreign Currency Risk
Our
 foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We managethese fluctuations, in
 part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations onknown
 future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposureto U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expend
itures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Weseek to
 mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to theCompany's
 forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes  1 and 4  to the consolidated  financial statements  included in Item 8 of this Report. Ahypothetical
 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2020, would havedecreased the fair value of the contracts by $111 and resulted in a
n unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.Commodity Price Risk
We
 are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturingoperations,
 which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in theU.S.
 and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel forour
 gas  stations,  on  an  index  basis.  These  contracts  meet  the  characteristics  of  derivative  instruments,  but  generally  qualify  for  the  “normalpurchases and normal sales” exception un
der authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.31

 Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
 Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 30,2020
 and  September  1,  2019,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  income,  comprehensive  income,  equity,  and  cash  flows  for  the  52-weekperiods
 ended  August  30,  2020,  September  1,  2019  and  September  2,  2018,  and  the  related  notes  (collectively,  the  consolidated  financialstatements).
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as ofAugust
 30,  2020  and  September  1,  2019,  and  the  results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  the  52-week  periods  ended  August  30,  2020,September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, in conformity with U.S. genera
lly accepted accounting principles.We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theCompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal  Control – Integrated Framework(2013)
 issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 6, 2020 expressed anunqualified opini
on on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Change in Accounting Principle
As
 discussed in Note 1  to  the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of September 2,2019 due to the adoption of Accountin
g Standards Update 2016-02 – Leases (ASC 842).Basis for Opinion
These
 consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on theseconsolidated
 financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  beindependent
 with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  theSecurities and Exchange Commissio
n and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Ouraudits
 included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error orfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures incl
uded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amountsand
 disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significantestimates
 made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our auditsprovide a reasonable basi
s for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The
 critical  audit matter  communicated  below is a matter  arising from the current  period audit of the consolidated financial statements  that  wascommunicated
 or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  theconsolidated
 financial statements  and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a criticalaudit matter does not
 alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating thecritical audit matter below, providing a separate opi
nion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.32

Table of ContentsEvaluation of self
-insurance liabilitiesAs discussed in 
Note 1  to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historicalclaims
 experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated insurance/self-insurance liabilitiesas
 of August 30, 2020 were $1,188 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation and general liability self-insurance liabilitiesfor the United States and Canadian operati
ons.We
 identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation and general liability self-insurance liabilities for the United States andCanadian
 operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the Company’sactuarial
 models and the judgments required to assess the underlying assumptions made by the Company. Specifically, subjective auditorjudgment
 was  required  to  evaluate  certain  assumptions  underlying  the  Company’s  actuarial  estimates,  including  reporting  and  paymentpatterns used in the projections of
 the ultimate loss; loss and exposure trends; the selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in thePaid and Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods; and the se
lection of the ultimate loss derived from the various methods.The
 following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested operatingeffectiveness
 of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance process. This included controls related to the development andselection
 of  the  assumptions  listed  above  used  in  the  actuarial  calculation  and  review  of  the  actuarial  report.  We  involved  actuarialprofessionals with 
specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:•
Assessing the actuarial models used by the Comp any for consistency with generallyaccepted actuarial standards
•
Evaluating the Company’s abi lity to estimate self-insurance liabilities by comparing itshistorical estimate with actual incurred losses and p
aid losses•
Evaluating the above listed assumpti ons underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates bydeveloping
 an  independent  expectation  of  the  self-insurance  liabilities  and  comparing  them  to  the  amounts  recorded  by  theCompany

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial R
eportingWe
 have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries’  (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2020,based
 on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  theTreadway
 Commission.  In  our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  ofAugust
 30,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission.
We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theconsolidated
 balance  sheets  of  the  Company  as  of  August  30,  2020  and  September  1,  2019,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  income,comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week p

 notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 6, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on thoseconsolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  theeffectiveness
 of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  OverFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
 an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We area
 public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.federal securities laws and the applic
able rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internalcontrol
 over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,  assessing the risk that a materialweakness
 exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit alsoincluded performing such other procedures as we co
nsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basisfor our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Fina
ncial ReportingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal  control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1) pertain  to the maintenance  of records  that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that  receipts  and expenditures  of the company  are being made only in accordance  with authorizations  of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  anyevaluation
 of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate./s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporat
ion (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based onthe
 concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandisecategories
 will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August 30, 2020, Costco operated 795 warehouses worldwide: 552 inthe
 United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 101 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 27in
 Japan,  16  in  Korea,  13  in  Taiwan,  12  in  Australia,  three  in  Spain,  and  one  each  in  Iceland,  France  and  China.  The  Company  operates  e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Austral
ia.Basis of Presentation
The
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controllinginterest.
 The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. Allmaterial
 inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. InFebruary 2020, the Company acquired a
 35% interest in Navitus Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefit manager. This investment is included in otherlong-term
 assets  and  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity-method  with  earnings/losses  recorded  in  other  income  in  the  consolidated  statement  ofincome. The
 Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to netincome relate to net income attributable to Costco.
Fiscal Year End
The
 Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2020, 2019, and2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended Au
gust 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively.Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements
 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to makeestimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions takeinto
 account  historical  and  forward  looking  factors  that  the  Company  believes  are  reasonable,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  potential  impactsarising
 from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from thoseestimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
 Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at thedate
 of  purchase,  and  proceeds  due  from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  with  settlement  terms  of  up  to  four  days.  Credit  and  debit  cardreceivables were $1,636 and $1,4
34 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively.40

Table of ContentsThe
 Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of2020
 and 2019 are $810 and $673, respectively, representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which thepayments were drawn.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term
 investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of threemonths
 to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term basedon
 their  highly  liquid  nature  and  because  they  represent  the  investment  of  cash  that  is  available  for  current  operations.  Short-term  investmentsclassified
 as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected inaccumulated
 other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, aredetermine
d on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Short-terminvestments
 classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reportednet of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring bas
is.The
 Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative andquantitative
 criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the loss in interest incomeand other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
 Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash andcash
 equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 3 , 4,and 
5 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.Fair
 value is defined  as the price  that  would be received  to  sell an asset  or paid to transfer  a liability in an orderly  transaction  between marketparticipants
 at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observableinputs when measuring fair value. The three leve
ls of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservab
le inputs that are corroborated by marketdata.
Level 3: Significant unobservab
le inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such asquoted net
 asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all othernon-derivative
 financial  instruments  are  based  on  independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  ofindependent
 external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves includingbut not limited to treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discou
nt rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can bederived
 principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable,using the fair value of the individual sec
urities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.41

Table of ContentsCurrent
 financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-termdebt,
 which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, andare
 being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily onreported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon i
nterest rates, maturities, and credit.Receivables, Net
Receivables
 consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables includediscounts and volume rebates. Balances are
 generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances,these
 receivables  may  be  settled  against  the  related  payable  to  that  vendor,  in  which  case  the  receivables  are  presented  on  a  net  basis.Reinsurance
 receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily  represent  amounts ceded throughreinsurance
 arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidatedbalance
 sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangement in the U.S.Third-party
 pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due fromgovernmental entities, mostly tax-related items.
Receivables
 are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specificidentification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial in 2020, 20
19, and 2018.Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the followi
ng:2020
2019 United States
$ 8,871 $ 8,415 Canada
1,310 1,123 Other Inte
rnational2,061 1,857 Merchandise inventories
$ 12,242 $ 11,395 Merchandise
 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, usingthe
 last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matchingcurrent
 costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation ordeflation, and these
 estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels havebeen
 determined.  As  of  August  30,  2020,  and  September  1,  2019,  U.S.  merchandise  inventories  valued  at  LIFO  approximated  first-in,  first-out(FIFO)
 after considering the lower of cost or market principle. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valuedusing the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the FIFO basis.
The
 Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision isadjusted
 periodically  to  reflect  physical  inventory  counts,  which  generally  occur  in  the  second  and  fourth  fiscal  quarters.  Inventory  cost,  whereappropriate,
 is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided thatthey are probable and
 reasonably estimable.42

Table of ContentsProperty and Equipment, Net
Property
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  is  computed  primarily  using  the  straight-line  method  overestimated
 useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimateduseful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any rene
wals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvementsare made.
The
 Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development,these
 costs are included in construction in progress. When the assets are ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment andfixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful liv
es.Repair and maintenance costs are expens
ed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change theway
 an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired.Assets
 classified  as  held-for-sale  at  the  end  of  2020  and  2019  were  immaterial.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  Company's  property  andequipment balances at the end of 2020 a

 Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes incircumstances
 may indicate the carrying amount of the asset  group, generally an individual warehouse,  may not be fully recoverable.  For assetgroups
 held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimatedfuture
 undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In theevent
 that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to theexcess
 of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), thecarrying
 value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisalsfrom third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charg
es recognized in 2020, 2019 or 2018.Leases
The Company leases land and/or
 buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more ofthe
 following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first
 refusal inthe event of a third-party offer.
43

Table of ContentsSome
 leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease andany
 extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leasesprovide for periodic rent increases based on price i
ndices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not containany material residual value guarante
es or material restrictive covenants.The
 Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and leaseobligations
 for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. As the rate implicit in theCompany's
 leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the Company's incrementalborrowing
 rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equalto
 the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive theincremental
 borrowing rate. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonablycertain
 that  the  Company  will  exercise  the  option.  Impairment  of  ROU  assets  is  evaluated  in  a  similar  manner  as  described  in  Property  andEquipment, Net above.
The
 Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. Theseobligations
 are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fairvalue
 of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The AROassets
 are  depreciated  using  the  same  depreciation  method  as  the  leasehold  improvement  assets  and  are  included  with  buildings  andimprovements.
 Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balancesheet.
Goodwill and Acquired In
tangible AssetsGoodwill
 represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Companyreviews
 goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances  indicate  carrying  value  may  exceed  the  fair  value.  Thisevaluation
 is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less thancarrying
 value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approachestimates
 fair  value  based  on  expected  discounted  future  cash  flows,  while  the  market  approach  uses  comparable  public  companies  andtransactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical a
nd expected future operating results.Goodwill is included in oth
er long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:United States

Table of ContentsInsurance/Self-insu
rance LiabilitiesClaims
 for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability,inventory
 loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limitexposures arising from very large losses. It uses different risk management mechanisms, includin
g a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (thecaptive) and
 participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and areestimated, in part, by considering historical claims experie
nce, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimatedaccruals for these
 liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At theend
 of 2020 and 2019, these insurance liabilities were $1,188 and $1,222 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries andbenefits and other current liabilities in the cons
olidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Comp
any’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in theconsolidated
 statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsuranceagreement
 is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the nextcalendar year.
 The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statementadjustments
 related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomesknown. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance pro
gram, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.Derivatives
The
 Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,through
 the use of forward foreign-exchange  contracts,  seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on knownfuture
 expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventoryexpenditures
 made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts donot
 qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage inspeculative
 transactions.  Some  of  these  contracts  contain  credit-risk-related  contingent  features  that  require  settlement  of  outstanding  contractsupon
 certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settlethe instruments immediate
ly if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2020 and 2019. The aggregatenotiona
l amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $1,036 and $704 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 4
 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2020 and 2019.The
 unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to thenet changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exch
ange contracts were immaterial  in 2020, 2019 and 2018.The Company is exposed to
 fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail andmanufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate throu
gh the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities,primarily
 in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel forits gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but general
ly qualify for the “normal purchasesand normal sales” exception under authoritativ
e guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.45

Table of ContentsForeign Currency
The
 functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assetsand
 liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded inaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company’s  consolidated  foreign  operations  are  translated  at  averageexchange rates pre
vailing during the year.The
 Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin
 currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these includethe
 U.S.  dollar  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  the  U.S.  dollar  payables  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  revalued  to  their  functional  currency.  Alsoincluded are realized foreign-currency gains or
 losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were immaterial in 2020,2019, and 2018.
Revenue Recognition
The
 Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2014-09  in  2019,  which  provided  for  changes  in  the  recognition  of  revenue  fromcontracts with customers. The Company recognizes sales for the amount of
 consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shippingfees
 where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves forestimated
 returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records,on
 a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, inthe consolidated balance 
sheets.The
 Company  offers  merchandise  in  the  following  core  merchandise  categories:  food  and  sundries,  hardlines,  softlines,  and  fresh  foods.  TheCompany
 also  provides  expanded  products  and  services  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  The  majority  of  revenue  frommerchandise
 sales  is  recognized  at  the  point  of  sale.  Revenue  generated  through  e-commerce  or  special  orders  is  generally  recognized  uponshipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping an
d handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costsand
 included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the memberpicks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are i
ncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.The Company
 is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it hascontrol
 of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible formerchandising
 decisions,  maintains  the  relationship  with  the  member,  including  assurance  of  member  service  and  satisfaction,  and  has  pricingdiscretion.
The
 Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferredmembership fees at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $1,8
51 and $1,711, respectively.In most countries, 
the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $1,000 peryear),
 which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, netof
 the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidatedbalance
 sheets.  Estimated  breakage  is  computed  based  on  redemption  data.  For  2020,  2019  and  2018,  the  net  reduction  in  saleswas $1,707, $1,537, and $1,394 respective
ly.46

Table of ContentsThe
 Company  sells  and  otherwise  provides  proprietary  shop  cards  that  do  not  expire  and  are  redeemable  at  the  warehouse  or  online  formerchandise
 or  membership.  Revenue  from  shop  cards  is  recognized  upon  redemption,  and  estimated  breakage  is  recognized  based  onredemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding sh
op card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage.Citibank,
 N.A. (“Citi”) became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various formsof
 consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion of which, after giving rise to estimated breakage, isused
 to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. Breakage is estimated based onredemption data.
Merchandise Costs
Merchandise
 costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costsrelated
 to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced byvendor consideration. Merchandise costs also i
nclude salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.Vendor Consideration
The
 Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced bysigned
 agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebateor
 discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reductionof merchandise costs upon completion of contractual mileston
es, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.Selling, General and Ad
ministrative ExpensesSelling,
 general  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  benefits  and  workers’  compensation  costs  for  warehouse  employees(other
 than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and homeoffice
 employees,  including buying personnel.  Selling,  general  and administrative  expenses  also include substantially  all building and equipmentdepreciation,
 stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  supportwarehouse and e-commerce website operatio
ns.Retirement Plans
The
 Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The planallows
 participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligibleparticipant
 an  annual  discretionary  contribution.  The  Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  Canadian  employees  and  contributes  apercentage
 of  each  employee's  wages.  Certain  subsidiaries  in  the  Company's  Other  International  operations  have  defined  benefit  and  definedcontribution
 plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $676, $614, and $578 for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, andare predominantly included in se
lling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.Stock-Based Compensation
RSUs
 granted to employees generally vest over five  years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that wouldvest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
47

Table of ContentsCompensation
 expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for theentire
 award.  Awards  for  employees  and  non-employee  directors  provide  for  accelerated  vesting  based  on  cumulative  years  of  service  with  theCompany.
 Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount ofcompensat
ion cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. Thefair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the prese
nt value of the expected dividendsforgone during the vesting period.
Stock-based
 compensation expense is predominantly  included in selling, general and administrative  expenses in the consolidated statements  ofincome. Certain
 stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 8  for additional in formation on theCompany’s stock-ba
sed compensation plans.Preopening Expenses
Preopening
 expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets,new manufacturing and distribution facil
ities, and expansions at existing warehouses and are expensed as incurred.Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future taxconsequences
 attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective taxbases
 and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxableincome
 in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxassets
 and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized  in  income  in  the  period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  A  valuation  allowance  isestablished when necessary to reduce d
eferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.The
 timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. Thebenefits
 of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-notprobability
 that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the  Companyreassesses these probabilities and records a
ny changes as appropriate.Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The
 computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  Thecomputation
 of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus thenumber
 of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stockmethod for shares subject to RSUs.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased
 shares  of  common  stock  are retired,  in accordance  with  the Washington  Business  Corporation  Act.  The par  value of  repurchasedshares
 is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital andretained
 earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and isapplied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaini
ng amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 7  for additional in formation.48

Table of ContentsRecent Accounting Pronoun
cements AdoptedIn
 February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (ASC 842), which required recognition on thebalance
 sheet  for  the  rights  and  obligations  created  by  leases  with  terms  greater  than  12  months.  The  Company  adopted  ASC  842,  using  themodified
 retrospective  transition  method  and  used  September  2,  2019,  as  the  date  of  initial  application.  Consequently,  the  comparative  periodspresented continue to be in accordance w
ith ASC 840, Leases, previously in effect.The
 Company  elected  the  package  of  practical  expedients  permitted  under  the  transition  guidance,  allowing  the  Company  to  carry  forwardconclusi
ons related to: (a) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases; (b) lease classification; and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases.The
 Company has elected not to record operating lease right-of-use assets or lease liabilities associated with leases with durations of 12 months orless.
 The Company elected the practical expedient allowing aggregation of non-lease components with related lease components when evaluatingthe accounting treatment for all classes of underlying assets.
Adoption
 of the new standard resulted in an initial increase to assets and liabilities of $2,632, related to recognition of operating lease right-of-useassets and operating lease obligations as of
 September 2, 2019. Other impacts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet were not material. Thestandard
 did  not  materially  impact  the  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  cash  flows.  For  more  information  on  the  Company's  leasearrangements refer to 
Note 6 . Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel
On
 March  17,  2020,  the  Company  acquired  Innovel  Solutions  for  $998,  using  existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  Cash  paid  excludes  the  finalsettlement of certain holdba
cks and provisional amounts, discussed below. As part of the acquisition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, a payment of $25was
 made  relating  to  certain  holdbacks.  Innovel  provides  final-mile  delivery,  installation  and  white-glove  capabilities  for  big  and  bulky  productsacross
 the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the dateof
 acquisition. Innovel's results of operations were not material to the Company's consolidated results during 2020. Pro forma results are thus notconsidered meaningful.
As
 of August 30, 2020, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete, pending determination of the final purchase price, working capitaladjustments,
 the fair value of operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and other assumed obligations. The net purchase priceof
 $998  was  allocated  to  tangible  and  intangible  assets  of  $283  and  liabilities  assumed  of  $219,  based  on  their  preliminary  fair  values  on  theacquisition
 date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $934 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits tothe
 Company, which include the ability to serve more members  and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce
 operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. Thechanges
 to  the  purchase  price  allocation  originally  recorded  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020  were  not  material.  As  additional  information  becomesavailable, the provisional fair val
ue estimates will be refined.49

(3) — Settlements
— (4) Lapse of statute of limitations
(3) (12) Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year
$ 30 $ 27 The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax
 positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timingof
 such deductibility. At the end of 2020 and 2019, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other thaninterest and penalties, the disallow
ance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cashto
 the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate infuture periods is $28 and $24 at the end of 2020 an
d 2019, respectively.Accrued
 interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penaltiesrecognized during 2020 an
d 2019 and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material.The Company is currently under
 audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in thenext
 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical toestimate the effect, if any, of
 any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection withthe audits. The Company does not anticipate that there wil
l be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in thenext 12 months.
The Company files income tax
 returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions.With
 few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2017. The Company iscurrently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 20
13 to present.Other Taxes
The
 Company  is  subject  to  multiple  examinations  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll,  product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes  in  variousjurisdictions.
 In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Subsequent to the end of 2019, the Company receivedan
 assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded a charge of $123 in 2019. In the fourth quarter of2020,
 the Company reached an agreement with the tax authority on this matter, resulting in a benefit of $84. Other possible losses or range ofpossible
 losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time.If
 certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the resultsof an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Legal Proceedings
The
 Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance withapplicable
 accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where theypresent loss contingencie
s that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. TheCompany
 monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnificationarrangements
 concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date ofthis
 Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accrualsfor
 matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish anaccrual,
 but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. Ineach
 case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where noaccrual
 has  been  recorded,  the  possible  loss  or  range  of  loss  (including  any  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrual)  cannot,  in  the  Company's  view,  bereasonab
ly estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factualtheories are not well developed; an
d/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.The

 Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effecton
 the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of thematters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an indiv
idual fiscal quarter or year.62

The
 Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan,Korea,
 Australia, Spain, Iceland, France, and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based onmanagement’s
 organization  of  the  operating  segments  for  operational  decisions  and  assessments  of  financial  performance,  which  considersgeographic
 locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note  1.  Inter-segment net sales and expenses havebeen
 eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, incurredon
 behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally comeunder the responsibility of U.S. management.

Our management is responsible for
 establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe
 Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  includes  those  policies  andprocedures
 that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositionsof
 our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  withappropriate
 authorizations;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  ordisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financi
al statements.Because of
 its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the policies or proced
ures may deteriorate.Under the
 supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reportingas
 of  August  30,  2020,  using  the  criteria  set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  in  InternalControl
— Integrated Framework (2013).Based
 on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 30, 2020. Theattestation
 of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting isincluded with the consolid
ated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.66

Exhibit 4.8DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
The
 following  description  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  is  based  upon  the  Company’s  Articles  of  Incorporation,  as  amended  (“Articles”),  theCompany’s
 Bylaws,  as  amended  (“Bylaws”),  and  applicable  provisions  of  law.  We  have  summarized  certain  portions  of  our  Articles  and  Bylawsbelow.
 This summary is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by express reference to, the provisions of our Articles andBylaws, each of which is filed as an exhib
it to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.8 is a part.Our
 authorized capital stock consists of 900,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 100,000,000 shares of undesignatedpreferred stock, $0.01 par value per share.
Common Stock
Dividend
 Rights. Subject  to the prior or preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock outstanding at the time, holders of our common stockare entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of legally ava
ilable funds.Voting Rights. 
Each share  of our common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters voted on by the shareholders, including the election ofdirectors. We have not provided for cumulative voting for the election of directors in our Articles.
Right
 to Receive Liquidation Distributions. Subject  to the prior or preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock outstanding at the time, inthe event of our liquidation, dissol
ution, or winding up, holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally availablefor distribution to shareholders.
Rights
 and Preferences. Holders  of  our  common  stock  have  no  preemptive  or  conversion  rights,  and  there  are  no  redemption  or  sinking  fundprovisions applicable to our common stock.
Preferred Stock
Our
 Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one ormore
 series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions thereof. These rights, preferences, and privileges could include dividendrights,
 conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms, and the number of shares constituting anyseries
 or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock by uscould
 adversely  affect  the  voting  power  of  holders  of  common  stock  and  the  likelihood  that  such  holders  will  receive  dividend  payments  andpayments
 upon liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock by us could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change incontrol of
 our company or other corporate action. No shares of preferred stock are outstanding, and we have no present plan to issue any shares ofpreferred stock.

Anti-Takeover ProvisionsWashington Anti-Takeover Law
Washington
 law imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and significant shareholders. Chapter 23B.19 of the WashingtonBusiness
 Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified “significant business transactions” with an “acquiringperson.”
 This statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and,accordingly,
 may discourage unsolicited attempts to acquire us. An “acquiring person” is generally defined as a person or group of persons thatbeneficially
 owns  the  voting  shares  entitled  to  cast  votes  comprising  10%  or  more  of  the  voting  power  of  the  target  corporation.  The  targetcorporation
 may  not  engage  in  “significant  business  transactions,”  as  defined  in  Chapter  23B.19,  for  a  period  of  five  years  after  the  date  of  thetransaction
 in which the person became an acquiring person, unless (1) the significant business transaction or the acquiring person’s purchase ofshares
 was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation’s board of directors prior to the share acquisition causing the person tobecome
 an  “acquiring  person,”  or  (2)  the  significant  business  transaction  was  both  approved  by  the  majority  of  the  members  of  the  targetcorporation’s
 board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding voting shares(excluding
 the acquiring person’s shares or shares over which the acquiring person has voting control) at or subsequent to the acquiring person’sshare acquisition. “Significant busi
ness transactions” include, among other things:•
a merger or share exchange with, disposition of assets to, or issuance or redemption of stock to or from, the acquiring person;•
a  termination  of  5%  or  more  of  the  employees  of  the  target  corporation  employed  in  the  State  of  Washington  as  a  result  of  theacquiring
 person’s acquisition of 10% or more of the shares, whether at one time or over the five-year period following the shareacquisition;
•
a transaction in which the acquiring person is allowed to receive a disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; or•
liquidating or dissolving the target corporation.After
 the five-year period, a “significant business transaction” may occur, as long as it complies with “fair price” provisions specified in the statute oris
 approved at a meeting of shareholders by a majority of the votes entitled to be counted within each voting group entitled to vote separately on thetransaction,
 not counting the votes of shares as to which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership or voting control. A corporation may not “optout” of this statute.
Articles of Incorporation, as Amended and Bylaws, as Amended
Our
 Articles and Bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in controlor changes in our management that a shareholder might de
em to be in the shareholder’s best interest. These provisions include the following:•
our Board of Directors may issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights or preferences as it may designate;- 2 -
29040-0271.0001/146637116.5

•our  Articles  and  Bylaws  provide  that  (1)  until  the  declassification  of  our  Board  of  Directors  implemented  by  amendments  to  ourArticles
 and  Bylaws  that  became  effective  in  January  2019  is  fully  phased  in  beginning  with  our  2022  annual  meeting  ofshareholders,
 the current three-year terms of certain of our directors will remain in effect until their current terms expire, and (2) onlyour
 Board of Directors may change the size of our Board of Directors, which provisions together generally make it more difficult forshareholders to replace a majority of our Board of Directors;
•
Washington  law,  our  Articles  and  Bylaws  limit  the  ability  of  shareholders  from  acting  by  written  consent  by  requiring  unanimouswritten consent for shareholder action to be effective;
•
our Articles and Bylaws limit who may call a special meeting of shareholders to only our Board of Directors, Chairman, President, anyExecutive Vice President or the Secretary or shareholders ow
ning an aggregate at least 10% of all votes entitled to be cast;•
our Bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates forelection
 as  directors  at  a  meeting  of  shareholders  must  provide  timely  advance  written  notice  to  us  in  writing,  and  specifyrequirements
 as to the form and content of a shareholder’s notice, which may preclude shareholders from bringing matters before ameeting of shareholders or from making nominations for directors at a meeting of sharehold
ers; and•
our Articles do not provide for cumulative voting for our directors, which may make it more difficult for shareholders owning less thana majority of our capital stock to elect any members to our Board of Directors.
