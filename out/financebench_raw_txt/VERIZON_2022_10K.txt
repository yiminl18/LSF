wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. 
In 2022, the Business segment's revenues were $31.1 billion, representing approximately 23% of Verizon’s consolidated 
revenues. As of December 31, 2022, Business had approximately 29 million wireless retail postpaid connections and 
approximately 1 million total broadband connections (which includes Fios internet, DSL and FWA connections). 
Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in Item 7. under the headings "Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" and - "Segment Results of Operations" and in Note 13 to 
the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. 
Service and Product Offerings 
Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers 
that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products 
and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small and Medium Business, Global 
Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. 
Wireless 
We offer wireless services and equipment to both Consumer customers and Business customers. 
Wireless Services 
Our Consumer and Business segments provide a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. 
Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily 
represent retail customers that are directly served and managed by Verizon and use Verizon branded services. A single account 
may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                4 
advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only 
to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in 
advance. As of December 31, 2022, we had 92 million postpaid connections, including FWA, and 23 million prepaid connections, 
representing approximately 80% and 20% of our Consumer wireless retail connections, respectively. 
Access to the internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. In addition, our customers can access the 
internet at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that are either wireless-enabled or that are used in conjunction 
with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. 
Historically, customers on our fixed-term service plans paid higher access fees for their wireless service in exchange for the 
ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. We no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, 
subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers. 
We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE wireless networks to our Consumer and Business customers. FWA 
enables fixed broadband access using radio frequencies instead of cables and can be used to connect homes and businesses to 
the internet. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1.5 million FWA broadband connections. 
Wireless Equipment 
Consumer and Business offer several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and 
other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as

to Consumer and Business customers. 
Our direct channel, including our company-operated stores, is a core component of our distribution strategy. Our sales and 
service centers and business direct sales teams also represent significant distribution channels for our services. In addition, we 
have a robust digital channel and omni-channel as a part of the customer experience in order to offer choice and convenience. 
Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the 
U.S., as well as through the internet. The majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                6 
also have relationships with high-profile national retailers that sell our wireless and wireline products and services, as well as 
convenience store chains that sell our wireless prepaid products and services. 
In addition to our direct channel, our Business segment has additional distribution channels that include business solution 
fulfillment provided by resellers, non-stocked device fulfillment performed by distributors and integrated mobility services 
provided by system integrators and resellers. 
Global Network and Technology 
Our global network architecture is used by Consumer and Business. Our network technology platforms include both wireless and 
wireline technologies. 
Network Evolution 
We are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and 
virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio 
access network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network 
elements, speed the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business 
market in a cost-efficient manner. As a part of our evolution, we retired our third-generation (3G) network in 2022. As a result, 
approximately 909 thousand wireless retail postpaid connections, including 392 thousand wireless postpaid phone connections, 
and 237 thousand retail prepaid connections, were removed from the customer base. 
5G 
Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the 
ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 
fourth-generation (4G) LTE technology and allows our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected 
devices grows. 
We provide 5G wireless service utilizing millimeter wave spectrum and other spectrum bands, some of which use dynamic 
spectrum sharing (DSS) technology. In January 2022, we began deploying C-Band spectrum, which has been built out to cover 
approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We expect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across 
the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes available for our use. Our FWA broadband service also 
leverages the 5G network and our expanding C-Band footprint, in addition to our 4G FWA offering. 
4G LTE 
The wireless network technology platform that carries the majority of our wireless traffic is 4G LTE. As of December 31, 2022, our 
4G LTE network covers approximately 328 million POPs, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. 
Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each 
carrier’s network assets with our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services 
(AWS) spectrum. LTE Home Internet, our home broadband internet service leverages the Verizon 4G LTE network. 
Wireless Network Reliability and Build-Out 
We consider the reliability, speed, capacity and coverage of our wireless network to be key factors for our continued success. We 
believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services. 
As we design and deploy our network, we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables, delivering on 
our advertised throughput speeds, and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being 
dropped. We utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network: increasing the density of our network elements, 
deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting additional wireless spectrum into service. 
We have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. 
Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for 
IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle 
increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We continue to deploy advanced technologies to 
increase both network capacity and data rates. 
In order to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must secure rights to a large number 
of sites and obtain zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for our macro and small cells, in-building systems 
and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety 
of vendors that supply various products and services that support our wireless network operations. We utilize tower site 
management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites. 
Our networks in the U.S. include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to 
our customers. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every 
macro cell. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a 
   7              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant 
Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations. 
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our 
customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a 
variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service 
providers outside the U.S. 
Fios 
Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that 
demand will continue to grow. We expect that the continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the 
proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and 
throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these 
demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner. 
While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread 
application in the Business segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services. 
Global IP 
Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectivity to Business 
customers in more than 180 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that enable and 
support international operations. 
Global business is rapidly evolving to an "everything-as-a-service" model in which Business customers seek cloud-based, 
converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. We are continuing to deploy packet 
optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand. 
Spectrum 
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice, video and data communications services. We 
are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz 
band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) 
spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C block, AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands in areas that 
collectively cover nearly all of the population of the U.S., and 3700-3900 MHz, also known as C-Band. We have also deployed 
4G technologies in 3.5 Gigahertz (GHz) shared spectrum, using LTE/Citizens Broadband Radio Service, and in 5 GHz 
unlicensed spectrum, using LTE/Licensed Assisted Access. All of this spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. 
We are using our low and mid-band spectrum to provide 4G LTE and 5G wireless services. As of December 31, 2022, we retired 
our 3G service. We are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3G service to provide 4G LTE service, and we 
completed that transition where needed at the end of 2022. We are also utilizing additional low and mid-band spectrum for 5G 
through DSS to complement both our C-Band and our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 GHz band, collectively called 
millimeter wave spectrum. 
Millimeter wave spectrum is being used in conjunction with low and mid-band spectrum for our 5G technology deployment. We 
own millimeter wave spectrum predominantly in the 28 GHz and 37/39 GHz bands. Millimeter wave spectrum is currently being 
used to increase capacity for mobile and fixed wireless services in areas of high demand. We anticipate that demand will 
continue to increase over time, driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband 
services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed 
services. We expect to meet the demand for 4G and 5G spectrum needs with our existing spectrum assets. If demand continues 
to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses 
or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum 
auctions occur. 
We use low and mid-band spectrum and DSS technology, to allow 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple 
spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s millimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-
enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum bands where this network is available. This allows us to 
more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G and 5G customers. 
From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap 
transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and 
expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the 
amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network 
performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.

Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. 
Competition and Related Trends 
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has 
eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication 
services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional 
participants seek increased market share. 
With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, 
including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail 
activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their 
customers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter Communications, Inc., and others. 
Competition remains intense as a result of various factors, including high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, 
increased network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, including 5G, the 
introduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional bundled premium content, increased levels of 
promotions and service plan discounts, new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and 
regulatory changes. In addition, increasing government incentives related to network deployment may enhance the ability of 
certain of our competitors to compete with us. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers 
merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication 
services. In addition, DISH Network Corporation has committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network in each of its 
license areas capable of serving at least 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023, which could result in additional competitive 
pressures in the U.S. wireless industry. 
We also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and 
capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings 
in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering 
alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless 
providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to see increasing 
competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless 
offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers. 
With respect to our wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic 
and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top (OTT) providers 
and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. We also face increasing competition from 
other providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal providers. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of 
their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. Several major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services 
through strategic relationships. Traditional wireless carriers are also bundling broadband internet offerings with wireless services 
while increasing their broadband internet footprint. Customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content 
from various online services. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We also 
expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers 
place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative. 
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry: 
• Network reliability, speed, capacity and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality, fast and 
reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. With the development of 5G 
technologies, wireless service providers are increasingly focusing their marketing efforts on network quality, speed and 
coverage, sometimes directly targeting customers of Verizon. In addition, lower prices, improved service quality and 
new service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of connectivity 
services. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity 
usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage. 
• Pricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless 
competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a 
range of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with 
other content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of 
Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, 
which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device 
leasing arrangements.  In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a 
greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. Pricing also plays 
an important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in 
offerings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy products. In addition, as non-traditional modes of 
providing wireline communication services emerge, new entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents 
   9              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
using competitive pricing. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free for 
customers and supported by advertising revenues. 
• Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting 
new customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based 
on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to 
promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. 
Customer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and 
Other customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of 
our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small and Medium Business customers 
through service representatives and online support, as well as through store-based representatives for small business 
customers. For Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives. 
• Product differentiation. Customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and 
enhanced products and services, as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. 
Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband, video 
and wireless connections. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their 
product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers. We 
continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative products and services, both 
independently and in collaboration with application providers, content providers and device manufacturers. Features 
such as wireless and wireline inter-operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both customer demand 
and technological advancement. 
• Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the 
wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution 
channels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, web-based sales and fulfillment 
capabilities, outside sales teams and telemarketing, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our 
sale of wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end users. 
In addition to these competitive factors and trends, our competitive position also depends on our ability to market our products 
and services effectively, anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our industries, as well as the availability of 
capital resources. 
Companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A relatively small number of 
telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, 
to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated 
solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand 
recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future 
revenue growth. 
In the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed 
and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumer-like "look and feel" are becoming key differentiators for customers who 
are seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses. Several major cable 
operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. 
In the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result of increased 
industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and 
software providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions, 
divesting non-strategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new alliances and acquisitions 
have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software defined networking, communication applications and other 
computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house machines. 
Our Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and 
data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are 
competitors for this business opportunity. 
Regulatory Trends 
Regulatory Landscape 
Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer 
regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has 
jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended 
(Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                10 
Federal, State and Local Regulation 
Wireless Services 
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, 
operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency 
spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new 
spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses 
or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. 
Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. 
Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, 
including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject 
to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a 
wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by 
that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require 
licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical 
limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic 
coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and 
requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. 
The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. 
The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other "terms and conditions" of wireless service. For example, some states 
impose reporting and consumer protection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues 
(for example, use of wireless handsets while driving), universal service funding, and taxation matters. Some states are also 
considering new network reliability or service quality requirements that may affect how and where we provide services if not 
preempted by federal law. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land 
use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. 
Broadband 
Verizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as 
"information services" subject to a "light touch" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. 
However, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, several states have adopted or are 
considering adopting laws or executive orders that would regulate broadband.  Although some of these have been challenged in 
court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed 
to the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. 
Our broadband commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-
commitment. 
Wireline Voice 
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on 
technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier" 
services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and 
other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers 
must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. 
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate 
matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent local exchange carrier" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent 
operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other 
wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. Some states, including California, impose reporting requirements and are 
considering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services, including for VoIP. 
Video 
Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply 
to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel 
video services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-
wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. 
Privacy and Data Security 
We are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all 
parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in 
the artificial intelligence and IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), depending on the product or service. The California Consumer Privacy Act, Europe's General Data 
Protection Regulation and a number of other privacy laws recently adopted by other states and countries include significant 
   11              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
penalties for non-compliance. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of 
government globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These 
regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. 
Public Safety and Cybersecurity 
The FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating 
widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks 
that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the 
cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by 
certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks 
from vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to 
impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless 
providers to support roaming on each other’s networks during disasters, and the California Public Utilities Commission has 
imposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities. 
Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access 
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline 
traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the 
rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is 
both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. 
Human Capital Resources 
At Verizon, we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets. In order to realize our core business strategy, we have 
developed human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees from the time they join our 
team through the entirety of their careers with Verizon. These programs are centered on the following principles: 
• Attract the right talent for our future and maintain a diverse workforce with high-value skills and expertise. 
• Develop our employees to their full potential through best-in-class educational programs and exceptional development 
experiences and create a culture of continuous learning and engagement. 
• Inspire individuals to build a career at Verizon by providing meaningful work and upskilling opportunities and 
establishing an inclusive work environment for all. 
Verizon is committed to being an employer of choice. With approximately 117,100 employees on a full-time equivalent basis as of 
December 31, 2022, 89% of whom are based in the U.S., we know that we need employees with diverse backgrounds, 
experiences and perspectives to best meet the needs of the diverse customers and communities we serve. Our human capital 
programs and practices are designed to create a workplace where employees are empowered to share their authentic selves 
and feel seen and heard as vital contributors to Verizon’s corporate purpose. In addition, Verizon has extensive on-the-job 
training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development support to enable our employees to maximize 
their potential and thrive professionally. Our long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion has resulted in a strong 
representation of women and people of color. As of December 31, 2022, Verizon's global workforce was approximately 66.5% 
male, 33.3% female and 0.2% unknown or undeclared, and the race/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was 52.5% White, 20.0% 
Black, 12.9% Hispanic, 8.2% Asian, 0.5% American Indian/Alaskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 2.7% two or 
more races, and 2.9% unknown or undeclared. Women represented 36.4% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and 
above). People of color represented 32.5% of U.S. senior leadership. 
Verizon respects our employees’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable law, 
including the right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of 
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers—the two unions that in total represent approximately 22.5% of 
our employees as of December 31, 2022. The current collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented 
employees who serve customers in our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast service areas extend through August 1, 2026. In addition, 
where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as works council. Verizon meets with 
U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, 
including safety, customer service, plans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that 
changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy. 
For a discussion of the oversight provided by the Company's Board of Directors over Verizon's human capital management 
practices, see the section entitled "Governance — Our Governance Framework — Oversight of human capital management" in 
our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to shareholders in 
connection with our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                12 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights 
necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain 
names to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in 
exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies 
that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and 
services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of Verizon's brands and the results of Verizon’s research and 
development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for Verizon, we do not believe that the loss of such 
consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. 
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in 
exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on 
third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers 
of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or 
cease offering the relevant products or services.

Item 
1A.    Risk Factors 
The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial 
condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Result of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following 
discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when 
evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical 
results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. 
Eco
nomic and Strategic Risks 
We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. 
We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has 
eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication 
services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telecommunications companies, cable companies, wireless 
service providers, satellite providers, technology companies and application and device providers. While these changes have 
enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own 
competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. 
Wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that 
vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our 
customers and putting pressure on pricing and margins. In addition, the wireless industry’s customer growth rate could moderate 
in comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. Our ability to compete effectively will 
depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality 
of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and 
distribution channels, our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources. It will also depend on 
how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business 
models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and evolving economic 
conditions, including inflation. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, our results of 
operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's 
revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and result in an impairment charge, which could 
have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
If we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer 
demand on a timely basis, or if the deployment of our 5G network is delayed or hindered for any reason, we 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                14 
may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and 
experience reduced profits. 
Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their 
communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need 
to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ 
changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an 
acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or 
the success of new services in the market. If our new services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated 
with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be 
adversely affected. 
In addition, the deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment and spectrum 
availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory matters that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. These 
issues could result in significant costs, put us at a competitive disadvantage, or reduce the anticipated benefits of the 
enhancements to our networks. 
As we introduce new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable 
technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, 
there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. 
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations and 
financial condition. 
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, or inflation in the 
markets in which we operate, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and 
our cost of doing business. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing 
purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost 
products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may 
delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse 
economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for 
services. Unfavorable economic conditions could also amplify other risk factors discussed in this section, including, but not 
limited to, our competitive position and margins. In 2022, as a result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we experienced 
increases in our direct costs, including electricity and other energy-related costs for our network operations, and transportation 
and labor costs, as well as increased interest expenses related to rising interest rates. We believe that this inflationary 
environment and the resulting decline in real wages in the U.S. are altering consumer preferences and causing consumers to 
become more price conscious. These factors, along with impacts of the intense competition in our industries, resulted in 
increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2022, and caused us to lower our growth expectations and related financial 
guidance.  We expect the inflationary environment and these other pressures to continue into 2023. Although we are taking 
various measures to improve efficiency and reduce costs, those measures may ultimately be ineffective or insufficient. If the 
economic slowdown in the U.S., inflation and other unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, they could have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
Op
erational Risks 
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. 
Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks, ransomware 
attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the 
operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse 
effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information 
of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ 
operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent 
years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the 
attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and 
updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks 
that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we 
take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to 
repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. 
The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a 
result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market 
share to our competitors. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered 
to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the 
use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such 
as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if 
   15              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Our presence in the IoT 
industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and 
expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of 
security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal 
information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could 
damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’s 
results of operation or financial condition. 
Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, acts of war, terrorist or other hostile acts could cause 
damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. 
Our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, acts of war, terrorist or other hostile acts, natural disasters 
or the potential impacts of climate change, including the increasing prevalence and intensity of hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, hail 
and storms. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting 
in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume 
operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. We are 
implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these 
events in the future, but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. 
These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need 
to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues from business 
interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits. 
Public health crises could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. 
We are subject to risks related to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an adverse effect on our 
operating results in 2020. Our business is based on our ability to provide products and services to customers throughout the 
United States and around the world and the ability of those customers to use and pay for those products and services for their 
businesses and in their daily lives. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially 
adversely affected by a public health crisis that significantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products 
and services, the way our employees are able to provide services to our customers, and the ways that our partners and suppliers 
are able to provide products and services to us. For example, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the 
transmission of COVID-19 and initiatives Verizon took in response to the health crisis to promote the health and safety of our 
employees and provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers, along with the related global slowdown in 
economic activity, resulted in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020. In addition, such a 
crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances, such 
as risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships, risks of an economic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs 
and availability of financing. 
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. 
We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, 
such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our 
business and provide products and services to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often 
rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are 
a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers 
or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a 
number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of geopolitical factors, public health 
crises, natural disasters or the potential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we may be unable to provide 
products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our 
networks. Due to the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could 
be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers 
with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such 
disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, 
results of operations and financial condition. 
The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, 
including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We 
are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to 
continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology . 
A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs 
or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. 
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 22.5% of our workforce is represented by the Communications Workers of America or 
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent 
negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                16 
operations. In addition, while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations is represented by 
unions for bargaining, we cannot predict what impact increased union density in this workforce could have on our operations. 
Reg
ulatory and Legal Risks 
Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business 
prospects or results of operations. 
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, and our international 
operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or 
impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently 
required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are 
often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is 
impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our 
operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit 
our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be 
successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, 
the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, 
certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state, and local, or international level, 
such as those described below, those that incentivize business models or technologies different from ours or requirements 
limiting our ability to continue or discontinue service to customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and 
wireless networks and operate our businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our 
ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. 
• Privacy and data protection  – We are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data 
protection. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy Act, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and a 
number of other privacy laws recently adopted by other states and countries include significant penalties for non-
compliance. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government 
globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These 
regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. 
• Regulation of broadband internet access services  – In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding "light 
touch" approach to regulating broadband internet access services and "reclassified" these services as 
telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the 2015 Title II 
Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order has 
been affirmed in part by the D.C. Circuit but may be revisited by the FCC or by Congress. Several states have also 
adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements 
on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCC’s 2015 rules). Although some of these have been 
challenged in court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. 
• "Open Access"  – We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC 
regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications 
of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and 
local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. 
• Climate-Related Regulation and Policy – Due to the nature of our operations, we have been, and expect to continue to 
be impacted by regulatory developments related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of 
greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven 
changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to 
purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs 
associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels. 
These developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions 
could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can 
expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. 
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or 
settlements. 
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation and claims in arbitration, including, but not limited to, shareholder derivative 
suits, patent infringement lawsuits, wage and hour class actions, contract and commercial claims, personal injury claims, 
property claims, environmental claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, 
our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones 
   17              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required 
to pay significant awards or settlements. 
F
inancial Risks 
Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and 
does not retire existing debt. 
As of December 31, 2022, Verizon had approximately $130.6 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $9.4 billion of 
unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and $20.0 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. 
Verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: 
• requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other 
amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working 
capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions; 
• making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital 
expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes and limiting its ability to 
repurchase common stock; 
• reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions; 
• making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and 
• exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable interest 
rates. 
Adverse changes in the financial markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the 
availability of financing. 
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through 
borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the financial markets, including increases in interest 
rates or changes in exchange rates, could increase our cost of borrowing, require us to post a significant amount of collateral, 
and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability 
to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of 
assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by 
independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. 
A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A 
severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and 
such instability could also affect our access to financing. 
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our 
profitability and increase our funding commitments. 
With approximately 117,100 employees and approximately 186,700 retirees as of December 31, 2022 eligible to participate in 
Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our 
profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several 
factors, including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit 
plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement 
expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and 
increase our funding commitments.

Item 2.    Properties 
Our principal properties do not lend themselves to simple description by character and location. Our total gross investment in 
property, plant and equipment was approximately $308 billion at December 31, 2022 and $290 billion at December 31, 2021, 
including the effect of retirements, but before deducting accumulated depreciation. Our gross investment in property, plant and 
equipment consisted of the following: 
At December 31, 2022 2021 
Network equipment  77.2%  76.9% 
Land, buildings and building equipment  11.7%  11.7% 
Furniture and other  11.1%  11.4% 
 100.0% 100.0%  
Network equipment consists primarily of cable (aerial, buried, underground or undersea) and the related support structures of 
poles and conduit, wireless plant, switching equipment, network software, transmission equipment and related facilities. Land, 
buildings and building equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that 
house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching 
centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the networks and high set-up and relocation 
costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the U.S. comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail 
sales locations, garage work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone 
equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, construction in process, and leasehold 
improvements. 
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings 
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal 
level. As of the date of this report, we do not believe that any pending legal proceedings to which we or our subsidiaries are 
subject are required to be disclosed as material legal proceedings pursuant to this item. Verizon is not subject to any 
administrative or judicial proceeding arising under any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted 
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment that is likely 
to result in monetary sanctions of $1 million or more. For a discussion of our litigation risks, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors.

PART II 
Item 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of 
Equity Securities 
The principal market for trading in the common stock of the Company is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VZ". 
As of December 31, 2022, there were 462,587 shareholders of record. In addition, a significant number of holders of the 
Company's common stock are "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, and other 
financial institutions. 
Stock Repurchases 
In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million 
shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, 
or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may 
be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans complying with 
Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on 
market conditions and our capital allocation priorities. 
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of the Company's common stock 
under our authorized share buyback program. At December 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased 
by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Overview 
Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the 
Company, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, technology, information and 
entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we 
offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand 
for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. 
To compete effectively in today’s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our high-performing networks to 
drive growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the digital world. In 2022, we focused on maintaining our 
network leadership, including by rapidly deploying C-Band spectrum; retaining and growing our high-quality customer base while 
balancing profitability in challenging market conditions; and driving monetization of our networks, platforms and solutions. We are 
creating business value by earning the trust of our stakeholders, limiting our environmental impact and supporting our customer 
base growth while creating social benefit through our products and services. Our strategy requires significant capital investments 
primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, 
invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant 
advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. 2022 was a peak year of capital investment for us as we 
rapidly deployed C-Band spectrum. We believe that this spectrum, together with our industry leading millimeter wave spectrum 
holding, 4G LTE network and fiber infrastructure, will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. 
We are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to secure our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G) 
and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. We expect that our next-generation multi-use platform, which we call the Intelligent 
Edge Network, will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology 
and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost efficient manner. Our network leadership is the hallmark of our 
brand and the foundation for the connectivity, platforms and solutions upon which we build our competitive advantage.

Business Overview 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group 
(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).

Consumer Business Corporate and Other 
Note: Excludes eliminations. 
Verizon Consumer Group 
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless 
services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand, 
TracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone) brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless 
access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and 
Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and 
over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and 
wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access 
from us on a wholesale basis. 
Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in 
advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only 
to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in 
advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of 
smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected 
devices, such as smart watches. 
In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity 
solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. The 
Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $103.5 billion, an increase of 
$8.2 billion, or 8.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. See "Segment Results of Operations" for additional 
information regarding our Consumer segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics. 
Verizon Business Group 
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and 
conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice 
services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products, including solutions that support 
fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, asset tracking and other types of mobile 
resource management. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and 
services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and 
services to customers around the world. The Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 
totaled $31.1 billion and remained relatively flat compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. See "Segment Results of 
Operations" for additional information regarding our Business segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics. 
Corporate and Other 
Corporate and other primarily includes insurance captives, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage 
businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee 
benefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested 
businesses, including Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media) divested in September 2021, and other adjustments and gains and 
losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded 
from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these 
transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating 
decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. See "Consolidated Results of Operations" for additional information 
regarding Corporate and other results. 
Capital Expenditures and Investments 
We continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the 
center of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for 
capital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows Used in 
Investing Activities" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at 
expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing 
in the information economy. 
Global Network and Technology 
We are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also 
building our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions 
and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video 
consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several 
years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and 
mobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows 
our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-
Band spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We 
expect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes 
available for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service 
to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s 
millimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum 
bands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve 
both 4G and 5G customers. 
To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks 
supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. 
We are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and 
virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio 
access network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network 
elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-
efficient manner.

   23             Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Corporate and other revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media, which was 
completed in September 2021. Verizon Media's total operating revenues were approximately $5.3 billion for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media. 
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."

Consolidated Operating Expenses $ 106,368 $ 101,165 $ 5,203  5.1 
Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations." 
Cost of Services 
Cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and 
supplies, content costs, contracted services, network access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer 
systems support, costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities and traffic acquisition costs. Aggregate 
customer service costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, 
general and administrative expense. 
Cost of services decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• a decrease in traffic acquisition costs of $2.2 billion primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media; 
• a decrease in personnel costs of $745 million primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media; 
• a decrease in digital content of $335 million primarily driven by the sale of Verizon Media; 
• a decrease in other direct costs of $322 million primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media; 
• a decrease in regulatory fees of $201 million due to a lower Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) volume and rate; 
• an increase in access costs of $614 million primarily due to the inclusion of TracFone results, partially offset by a 
decline in voice services; and 
• an increase in rent expense of $212 million related to adding capacity to the networks to support demand and lease 
modifications for certain existing cell towers in April 2021 to support the build out of our 5G wireless network. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media and the acquisition of 
TracFone. 
Cost of Wireless Equipment 
Cost of wireless equipment increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• an increase of $2.2 billion due to the inclusion of TracFone results; 
• an increase of $2.1 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to upgrades; and 
• an increase of $1.3 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or 
product, the provision for credit losses, taxes other than income taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, call center and 
information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees and rent and utilities for administrative space. Also 
included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in "Cost of Services." 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• an increase in the provision for credit losses of $822 million driven by increased device payment loan volume and an 
increase in the expected loss rate primarily as a result of the change in device payment plan terms to 36 months, as 
well as actions taken in prior years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
• the $706 million net gain on the sale of Verizon Media in 2021; 
• an increase in personnel costs of $603 million primarily related to the inclusion of TracFone results and increases in 
third-party employee costs due to contracted services, partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of Verizon Media; 
• a decrease of $367 million in other general expenses driven by lease terminations primarily due to the sale of Verizon 
Media; and 
• the $223 million loss resulting from agreements entered into to sell certain wireless licenses in 2021.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media, the acquisition of 
TracFone and spectrum license transactions. 
Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the change in the mix of net 
depreciable and amortizable assets, including acquisition-related intangible assets, as well as the deployment of C-Band 
spectrum.

Other income (expense), net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including interest income, gains and 
losses from non-operating asset dispositions, debt extinguishment costs, components of net periodic pension and postretirement 
benefit cost and income and certain foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Other income (expense), net changed during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• a net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gain of $1.7 billion recorded during 2022, compared with a 
net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gain of $2.4 billion recorded during 2021; and 
• net debt extinguishment losses of $1.1 billion primarily related to tender offers in 2022, compared with losses of 
$3.5 billion in connection with tender offers, the redemptions of securities issued by Verizon and open market 
repurchases of various Company and subsidiary notes in 2021. 
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the other components of net periodic pension 
and postretirement benefit income. 
Interest Expense 
(dollars in millions) 
Increase/(Decrease) 
Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 
Total interest costs on debt balances $ 5,643 $ 5,326 $ 317  6.0 %

Average debt outstanding (1) (3) $ 151,226 $ 147,035 
Effective interest rate (2) (3)  3.7 %  3.6 % 
(1) The average debt outstanding is a financial measure and is calculated by applying a simple average of prior thirteen-month 
end balances of total short-term and long-term debt, net of discounts, premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs. 
(2) The effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt. It is calculated by dividing the total interest costs on 
debt balances by the average debt outstanding. 
(3) We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our 
debt financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management. 
Total interest expense increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• an increase in interest costs due to a combination of higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances; 
partially offset by 
• an increase in capitalized interest costs as a result of a full year of capitalized interest on C-Band licenses in 2022 
compared to a partial year in 2021. 
See Note 4 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on spectrum licenses and debt 
transactions, respectively.

ears Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 
Provision for income taxes $ 6,523 $ 6,802 $ (279)  (4.1) % 
Effective income tax rate  23.1 %  23.1 % 
The 
effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income 
taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was comparable to the similar period in 2021. The 
decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes in 2022. 
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated 
Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures that we 
believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a 
more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and 
acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’s competitors. 
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense to net income. 
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational 
items: equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of certain 
special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in 
evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s 
evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a 
company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and 
depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to 
prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional information. 
It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’s GAAP financial 
information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in 
accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not 
to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures 
in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and 
accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be 
determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.

The changes in Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the table above during 
2022 compared to 2021, were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating 
expenses. 
Segment Results of Operations 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We 
measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent 
with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. 
To aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income, management uses the following 
operating statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our segments. We believe these operating statistics are useful to 
investors and other users of our financial information because they provide additional insight into drivers of our segments’ 
operating results, key trends and performance relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be determined or calculated 
differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those statistics of other companies.

GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We 
believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating 
profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital 
expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our 
competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income 
(loss). Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. See Note 13 to 
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

   29              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Consumer's total operating revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021, as a result of increases in Service and Wireless 
equipment revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Other revenue. 
Service Revenue 
Service revenue increased during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by increases in wireless and Fios service revenues. 
Wireless service revenue increased $5.4 billion during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• an increase of $4.0 billion, representing the net impact of the acquisition of TracFone in the fourth quarter of 2021; 
• an increase of $769 million in access revenues related to our postpaid plans driven by mobile security products included 
in certain device protection packages such that a larger amount of the overall device protection revenue is recognized in 
Service revenue, pricing actions implemented in the second half of 2022, cloud services, and additional connections 
and migrations to higher priced plans, partially offset by related promotions as well as declines in our postpaid phone 
customer base; 
• an increase of $352 million in TravelPass revenues due to an increase in customer international travel; and 
• an increase of $253 million related to growth in non-retail service revenue. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, Fios service revenue totaled $10.9 billion, representing an increase of $127 million 
compared to 2021, primarily resulting from an increase in Fios internet connections, reflecting increased demand for higher 
broadband speeds, partially offset by a decrease in Fios video and voice revenues. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition of TracFone. 
Wireless Equipment Revenue 
Wireless equipment revenue increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• an increase of $1.4 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold; 
• an increase of $1.2 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices primarily related to a higher rate of upgrades, 
partially offset by related promotions; and 
• an increase of $780 million due to the inclusion of TracFone results. 
Other Revenue 
Other revenue includes fees that partially recover the direct and indirect costs of complying with regulatory and industry 
obligations and programs, revenues associated with certain products included in our device protection offerings, leasing and 
interest when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement. 
Other revenue decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $481 million that resulted from a change in the product mix within the device protection offering such that 
a smaller amount of the overall device protection revenue is recognized in Other revenue; 
• a decrease of $77 million related to interest recognition on equipment sold to the customer by an authorized agent 
under a device payment plan agreement, mainly due to an increase in contract terms to 36 months; and 
• a decrease of $51 million in other regulatory surcharges.

• an increase in access costs of $848 million primarily due to the inclusion of TracFone results; and 
• an increase in rent expense of $198 million related to adding capacity to the networks to support demand and lease 
modifications for certain existing cell towers in April 2021 in connection with the build out of our 5G wireless network. 
Cost of Wireless Equipment 
Cost of wireless equipment increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

• an increase in personnel costs of $1.3 billion primarily due to the inclusion of TracFone results and increased third-party 
employee costs due to contracted services; 
• an increase in provision for credit losses of $745 million driven by increased device payment loan volume and an 
increase in the expected loss rate primarily as a result of the change in device payment plan terms to 36 months, as 
well as actions taken in prior years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
• an increase in advertising expense of $454 million primarily due to the inclusion of TracFone results and brand 
marketing, including the launch of the 5G Ultra campaign in early 2022. 
Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2022 compared to 2021, driven by the change in the mix of total 
Verizon depreciable and amortizable assets and Consumer's usage of those assets.

Business's total operating revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021, as a result of an increase in Small and Medium 
Business revenue, partially offset by decreases in Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other and Wholesale revenues. 
Small and Medium Business 
Small and Medium Business offers wireless services and equipment, conferencing services, tailored voice and networking 
products, Fios services, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, advanced voice solutions and security and managed information 
technology services to our U.S.-based small and medium businesses that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as 
Global Enterprise, as described below. 
Small and Medium Business revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• an increase in wireless equipment revenue of $507 million driven by a higher volume of devices sold and a shift to 
higher priced equipment in the mix of devices sold, partially offset by an increase in promotions; 
• an increase in wireless service revenue of $395 million primarily driven by an increase in the amount of wireless retail 
postpaid connections as well as the economic adjustment charge that took effect in the second quarter of 2022; and 
• a decrease of $85 million related to the loss of voice and DSL service connections. 
Fios revenues totaled $1.0 billion, which represents an increase of $41 million during 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was 
primarily related to increases in total connections, as well as increased demand for higher broadband speeds. 
Global Enterprise 
Global Enterprise offers services to large businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with 
Verizon, as well as non-U.S. public sector customers.
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                32 
Global Enterprise revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $544 million in networking revenue and traditional data and voice communication services related to 
secular pressures in the marketplace; 
• a decrease of $118 million due to lower FUSF volume and rate along with resulting surcharges; 
• an increase of $117 million in wireless equipment revenue driven by a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of 
devices sold and higher volume of devices sold; 
• an increase of $89 million in wireless service revenue primarily driven by an increase in the amount of wireless retail 
postpaid connections as well as the economic adjustment charge that took effect in the second quarter of 2022; and 
• an increase of $34 million in customer premise equipment primarily due to higher volumes. 
Public Sector and Other 
Public Sector and Other offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity and managed solutions to U.S. 
federal, state and local governments and educational institutions. These services include business services and connectivity 
similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with features and pricing designed to address the 
needs of governments and educational institutions. 
Public Sector and Other revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:  
• a decrease of $169 million in networking revenue and traditional data and voice communication services related to 
secular pressures in the marketplace; and 
• a decrease of $44 million related to lower FUSF volume and rate along with resulting surcharges. 
Wholesale 
Wholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to 
local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. 
Wholesale revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $113 million related to declines in traditional voice communication and network connectivity as a result of 
technology substitution and rationalization of international traffic, as well as a decrease in core data.

• an increase of $360 million related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $88 million primarily due to gains recognized in connection with a non-strategic divestiture and other 
activity; 
• a decrease of $78 million primarily due to taxes other than income mainly driven by a one-time international tax benefit; 
• a decrease in other general expenses of $72 million partly related to rent and lease expenses; 
• an increase in personnel expense of $148 million primarily related to increased third-party employee costs due to 
contracting services; and
   33              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
• an increase of $73 million in provision for credit losses driven by increased device payment loan volume and an 
increase in the expected loss rate primarily as a result of the change in device payment plan terms to 36 months.

Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets 
During 2022 and 2021, we recorded pre-tax amortization expense of $826 million and $594 million, respectively, related to 
acquired intangible assets. 
Severance, Pension and Benefits Charges (Credits) 
During 2022, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, 
we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $1.7 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits 
were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of 
$7.0 billion due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans 
($4.1 billion) and postretirement benefit plans ($2.9 billion) from a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021 to a 
weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022, a charge of $5.5 billion due to the difference between our estimated and our 
actual return on assets and a credit of $206 million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 2022, we also 
recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $304 million, related to involuntary separations under our existing plans, in Selling, 
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. 
During 2021, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, 
we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.4 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits 
were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of 
$1.1 billion due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans 
and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020 to a weighted-average of 2.9% at 
December 31, 2021, a credit of $847 million due to the difference between our estimated and our actual return on assets and a 
credit of $453 million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 2021, we also recorded net pre-tax severance 
charges of $209 million related to voluntary separations under our existing plans in Selling, general and administrative expense 
in our consolidated statement of income. 
Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits 
charges (credits) in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. 
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to severance, pension and benefits 
charges (credits). 
Early Debt Redemption Costs 
During 2022, we recorded pre-tax early debt redemption costs of $1.2 billion primarily in connection with tender offers. 
During 2021, we recorded pre-tax early debt redemption costs of $3.5 billion in connection with tender offers, the redemptions of 
securities issued by Verizon and open market repurchases of various Company and subsidiary notes. 
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our early debt redemptions. 
Net Gain from Disposition of Asset and Business 
During 2021, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $837 million, in connection with the sale of an investment and the sale of Verizon 
Media. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Loss on Spectrum Licenses 
During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $223 million as a result of signing two agreements to sell certain wireless licenses. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Operating Environment and Trends 
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has 
eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication 
services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional 
participants seek increased market share. Our high-quality customer base and networks differentiate us from our competitors 
and give us the ability to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive conditions. We remain focused on 
executing on the fundamentals of the business: maintaining a high-quality customer base, delivering strong financial and 
operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance while aggressively building 
out our 5G network. 
The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone 
connection growth for the industry. We expect future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer 
   35              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services and increasing the 
penetration of FWA and connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. Although certain use cases for 5G 
technologies and related ecosystems are in early development stages, we expect this technology will provide a significant 
opportunity for growth in the coming years. With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against 
other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service 
providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, 
including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter 
Communications, Inc., and others. We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to 
increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in 
addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, 
Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used 
in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to 
see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed 
wireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers. 
With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless competitive 
landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best 
available value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a 
range of service plans at competitive prices. These service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs, 
technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers. 
In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers 
interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. 
We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer demand for 5G 
connectivity continues to expand and customers shift to higher access plans, driven in part by attractive bundled content with 
premium brands, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be 
dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our 
networks and services and the development of new ecosystems. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment 
manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of 
time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. 
Current and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic 
and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top providers and 
other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. We also face increasing competition from other 
providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal providers. 
In addition, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services. A relatively small 
number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise 
market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide 
integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, 
brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future 
revenue growth. 
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services. We continue to 
provide network reliability and offer products, which include fiber-optic internet access, several video services, and voice 
services. Further, we will continue to offer our business and government customers a converged-enterprise environment for 
voice and data services as well as more robust IP products and services, and advance our IoT strategies by leveraging business 
models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. 
We will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to allow us to have flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive and 
economic environments and increase shareholder value. 
Macroeconomic Environment 
In 2022, as a result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we experienced increases in our direct costs, including electricity 
and other energy-related costs for our network operations, and transportation and labor costs, as well as increased interest 
expenses related to rising interest rates. We believe that this inflationary environment and the resulting decline in real wages in 
the U.S. are altering consumer preferences, and causing certain consumers to become more price conscious. We expect the 
inflationary environment and the resulting pressures to continue in 2023. For a discussion of the risks relating to unfavorable 
economic conditions and inflation to our business, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors. 
2023 Connection Trends 
In our Consumer segment, we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain high-quality retail postpaid customers, 
capitalizing on demand for data services and providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We 
expect that future connection growth will be driven by FWA, as well as smartphones, tablets and other connected devices such 
as wearables. We believe the combination of our wireless network performance and service offerings provides a superior 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                36 
customer experience, supporting increased penetration of data services and the continued attraction and retention of higher 
valued retail postpaid connections. For our prepaid business, we expect to continue to operate in a competitive environment 
while making investments to achieve long-term success in this space. 
We expect to continue to grow our Fios internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service 
areas, further supported by the demand for higher speed internet connections. At the same time, we expect accelerating fixed 
wireless access connections to complement strong Fios results as demand for broadband services continues to grow. In Fios 
video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market.  Given these trends, 
we provide standalone Fios internet plans in addition to the choice of Fios video or a streaming service provided by a partner. We 
have experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and 
switched to alternative technologies such as wireless, Voice over Internet Protocol, and cable for voice and data services. 
In our Business segment, we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers across the U.S. We 
continue to grow our retail connections while operating in a highly competitive environment. We expect that this connection 
growth, combined with our industry-leading network assets, will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions, such as those 
around security, advanced communications and professional services. We also expect to expand our existing services offered to 
business customers through our Intelligent Edge Network, our multi-use platform. 
In addition, in both our Consumer and our Business segments, we expect to support connection growth in part by adding 
capacity and further expanding our wireless coverage, and by continuing the build-out of our 5G network. 
2023 Operating Revenue Trends 
In our Consumer segment, we expect to see a continuation of service revenue growth in 2023 as customers shift to higher 
access plans with additional services and increase the number of devices they connect with our networks and services. We 
expect continued growth in wireless service revenue, driven by migrations to higher priced plans, increases in fixed wireless 
access connections, and the pricing actions implemented in the second quarter of 2022. We expect Fios revenue to benefit in 
2023 as growth in our broadband customer base and increases in demand for higher speed internet connections offset the 
impact of the shift from the bundling of wireline services to standalone Internet service. 
In our Business segment, we expect wireless revenue to expand, driven by growth from increases in wireless volumes and fixed 
wireless access contributions. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and 
legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures. 
2023 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends 
We expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we 
continue to drive revenue growth and undertake initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure. We expect that our ability to 
generate cash flows will benefit from our anticipated reduction in capital expenditures as we reach the end of our dedicated C-
Band spending program, as well as our actions to better monetize our assets which increase our return on invested capital. We 
created the Verizon Global Services group, an organization that is expected to drive efficiencies by centralizing key functions and 
strategically delivering key services across Verizon. 
We create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions 
that support continued profitable growth, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In 
addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders. Our Board of Directors 
increased the quarterly dividend by 2.0% during 2022, making this the sixteenth consecutive year in which we have raised our 
dividend. 
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities 
that will help us to grow the business, strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licenses (see "Cash Flows from Investing 
Activities"), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock (see 
"Cash Flows from Financing Activities"). 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund expansion and modernization of our networks, service and repay 
external financing, pay dividends, invest in new businesses and spectrum and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our 
outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing 
arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. 
Our cash and cash equivalents balance is $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both 
domestically and internationally, and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity. See "Market Risk" for additional 
information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.
   37              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt 
or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, or to maintain an appropriate capital 
structure to ensure our financial flexibility. Our external financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of 
credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, 
U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain 
receivables through asset-backed debt transactions. 
Capital Expenditures 
Our 2023 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding our core networks, 
adding capacity and density to our 5G network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying 
C-Band, transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network while reducing the cost to deliver services to our 
customers, and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. We expect that our network architecture will simplify 
operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, and 
create new enterprise opportunities in the business market. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2023 capital program to be 
between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, inclusive of the final $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion related to our 
accelerated C-Band deployment program. 
Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
We have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements 
from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022: 
• Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $149.4 billion, of which $9.3 billion are expected to be due 
within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $73.6 billion, of which $5.6 billion, are expected to be due 
within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt 
issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 
• Operating lease obligations of $29.8 billion and Finance lease obligations of $1.8 billion, of which $4.6 billion and 
$586 million, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. In addition, Verizon has an obligation 
of $675 million representing future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, of which 
$297 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information. 
• Unconditional purchase obligations, with terms in excess of one year, amount to $24.5 billion, of which $9.4 billion is 
expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in unconditional purchase obligations are primarily 
commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items 
which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated 
purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase 
products and services as needed with no firm commitment. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information. 
• Estimated commitments for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the 
incumbent license holders associated with C-Band wireless spectrum acquired under Auction 107. The remaining 
commitment is estimated to be $4.8 billion, all of which is expected to be due within the next twelve months. 
• Other long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $4.1 billion, of which $827 million is expected to be due within 
the next twelve months. Other long-term liabilities represent estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan 
contributions. Qualified pension plan contributions include estimated minimum funding contributions. We expect that 
there will be no required pension funding through 2026, subject to changes in market conditions. Postretirement benefit 
payments include future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based 
on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which could impact the timing and/or amounts of these 
payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. 
• We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.8 billion and 
related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective taxing authorities until the related tax audits are further 
developed or resolved. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities 
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities 
decreased by $2.4 billion during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher device payment receivables as our device 
payment portfolio increased over the comparative period, which was partially due to the change in device payment plan terms to 
36 months. This decrease was further driven by a decrease in earnings. We expect to make approximately $200 million of 
discretionary pension contributions in 2023. Additionally, we expect that there will be no required pension funding through 2026, 
subject to changes in market conditions. 
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities 
Capital Expenditures 
Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to increase the operating efficiency and 
productivity of our networks, maintain our existing infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and 
enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges. 
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were $23.1 billion and $20.3 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capital 
expenditures increased approximately $2.8 billion during 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to accelerating our 5G 
technology deployment. See "Global Network and Technology" for more details. 
Acquisitions of Wireless Licenses 
In February 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction, Auction 107, for mid-band spectrum 
known as C-Band. During 2021, we paid approximately $45.9 billion for spectrum licenses in connection with this auction and 
related costs, of which $1.3 billion was primarily paid for certain obligations related to projected clearing costs. During 2022, we 
made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing costs associated 
with the auction. 
In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain 
markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022, Verizon made payments of 
approximately $310 million associated with these agreements. 
During 2022 and 2021, we recorded capitalized interest related to wireless licenses of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
During 2022 and 2021, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of an 
insignificant amount and $95 million, respectively. 
Cash Received (Paid) Related to Acquisitions of Businesses, Net of Cash Acquired 
In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire TracFone, a provider of prepaid and value mobile services 
in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date). The aggregate cash consideration paid by 
Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $3.6 billion, net of cash acquired, approximately 57.6 million shares 
of our common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent 
consideration. During 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $248 million for the final settlement of working capital, which 
was included in our consideration as of the Acquisition Date. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional 
information. 
In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular (Bluegrass), a rural 
wireless operator serving central Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by 
Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $412 million, net of cash acquired. 
During 2022 and 2021, we completed various other acquisitions for cash consideration of an insignificant amount and 
approximately $51 million, respectively. 
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for information on our acquisitions. 
Collateral Payments Related to Derivative Contracts, Net of Repayments 
During 2022 and 2021, we made payments of $2.3 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of derivative collateral, net of 
repayments. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Proceeds from Disposition of Business 
During 2021, we received cash proceeds of $4.1 billion, net of cash transferred, in connection with the sale of Verizon Media. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other, Net 
During 2021, we received cash of $321 million in connection with the settlement of a note receivable related to TracFone and net 
cash proceeds of $98 million in connection with the sale of an investment. 
Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to 
protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2022, net cash used in 
financing activities was $8.5 billion. During 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $8.3 billion. 
2022 
During 2022, our net cash used in financing activities of $8.5 billion was primarily driven by $13.6 billion used for repayments, 
redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations, 
$10.8 billion used for dividend payments and $2.1 billion used for other financing activities. These cash flows used in financing 
activities were partially offset by $17.8 billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $10.7 billion of 
proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions. 
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings 
At December 31, 2022, our total debt decreased to $150.6 billion compared to $150.9 billion at December 31, 2021. Our effective 
interest rate was 3.7% and 3.6% during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have entered into 
interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt, managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. 
See also "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
At December 31, 2022, approximately $34.0 billion, or 22.5%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio 
consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on 
our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of 
foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information. 
Verizon may acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates through open market purchases, redemptions, privately 
negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from 
time to time determine, for cash or other consideration. 
Other, Net 
Other, net financing activities during 2022 includes the cash consideration payments to acquire additional interests in certain 
controlled wireless partnerships and early debt redemption costs. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information on noncontrolling interests. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on the early debt redemption costs. 
Dividends 
The Board of Directors of the Company assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such 
factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third 
quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.0% to $0.6525 from $0.6400 per share in 
the preceding quarter. This is the sixteenth consecutive year that Company’s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly 
dividend increase. 
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2022, we paid $10.8 billion in 
dividends. 
2021 
During 2021, our net cash provided by financing activities of $8.3 billion was primarily driven by $41.4 billion provided by 
proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $8.4 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions. These 
cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by $18.9 billion used for repayments, redemptions and 
repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations, $10.4 billion used for 
dividend payments and $3.8 billion used for other financing activities.
  
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings 
At December 31, 2021, our total debt was $150.9 billion, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, our effective interest 
rate was 3.6%. The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in 
interest rates did not have a material effect on our interest payments. See "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial 
statements for additional information.
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                40 
At December 31, 2021, approximately $33.5 billion, or 22.2%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio 
consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on 
our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of 
foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information. 
Other, Net 
Other, net financing activities during 2021 includes $320 million in payments related to vendor financing arrangements, 
$161 million in postings of derivative collateral and early debt redemption costs. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial 
statements for additional information on the early debt redemption costs. 
Dividends 
During the third quarter of 2021, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.0% to $0.6400 per share. 
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2021, we paid $10.4 billion in 
dividends. 
Asset-Backed Debt 
As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $20.0 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-
Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks 
and their conduit facilities (collectively, the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, 
an ABS Entity or collectively, the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in 
connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership (Cellco), a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain other Company affiliates (collectively, the Originators) transfer device 
payment plan agreement receivables and certain other receivables (collectively referred to as certain receivables) to one of the 
ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities retain the 
equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to 
make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses. 
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and future collections on such receivables. These receivables 
transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of 
asset-backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of certain 
receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other 
obligations or claims of Verizon’s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The 
Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do 
not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support 
agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS 
Entities. 
Cash collections on the receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be 
placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in 
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated 
statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our 
consolidated balance sheets. 
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Total $ 20,500 $ 10,436 $ 6,735    
(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it 
permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the 
issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no drawings against the $9.5 billion revolving credit 
facility since its inception. 
(2) During 2022 and 2021, we drew down $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, from these facilities. Borrowings under certain 
of these facilities are amortized semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect 
   41              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot 
be reborrowed. 
Common Stock 
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. 
During both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we issued 2.1 million shares of common stock from treasury stock, 
which had aggregate values of $91 million. 
In connection with our acquisition of TracFone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of common stock 
from treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional 
information. 
In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million 
shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, 
or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. The program permits Verizon to 
repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. 
There were no repurchases of common stock during 2022 and 2021 under our authorized share buyback program. 
Credit Ratings 
Verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2022 or 2021. 
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold 
securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating 
should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
Covenants 
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include 
requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable 
insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain 
our properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and 
consolidations, and other similar covenants. 
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. 
Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 totaled $2.6 billion, a $316 million decrease compared to December 31, 
2021, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. 
Restricted cash at December 31, 2022 totaled $1.5 billion, a $266 million increase compared to restricted cash at December 31, 
2021, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into 
segregated accounts. The increase was primarily driven by the completion of asset-backed debt transactions during the year 
ended December 31, 2022. 
Free Cash Flow 
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when 
viewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors and other users of our financial information with a more 
complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital 
expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative 
measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the 
fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does 
not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. 
Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:  
 (dollars in millions) 
Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 37,141 $ 39,539 
Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 23,087 20,286 
Free cash flow $ 14,054 $ 19,253   
The decrease in free cash flow during 2022 is a reflection of the decrease in operating cash flows, as well as the increase in 
capital expenditures, both of which are discussed above.

Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions 
Employer Contributions 
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily 
relate to our domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2022 or 2021. 
During 2022 and 2021, we made contributions of $53 million and $58 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. 
Our overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into 
consideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we 
have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging 
assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline 
at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and 
its participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will 
generally result in lower expected asset returns. In 2023, we expect discretionary qualified pension plan contributions to be 
approximately $200 million and nonqualified pension plan contributions to be insignificant. 
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since 
these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $692 
million and $885 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contributions to our other 
postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $820 million in 2023. 
Leasing Arrangements 
See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to leasing arrangements. 
Guarantees 
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial 
statements for additional information. 
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides 
representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the 
securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
As of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $834 million, which were executed in the normal course of 
business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16 to 
the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Other Future Obligations 
During 2022, Verizon entered into four renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 20 
signed in previous years. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Under the REPAs, we 
plan to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 3.0 gigawatts of capacity across multiple states, including Arizona, Illinois, 
Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia. 
Cri
tical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
Critical Accounting Estimates 
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows: 
Wireless Licenses and Goodwill 
Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill 
are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in 
the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim 
period suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent 
appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the 
assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions 
are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be 
changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market 
participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in 
different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and 
assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting 
units.
   43              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Wireless Licenses 
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $149.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. We aggregate our 
wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our 
nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum 
to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other 
factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. 
We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have 
the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment 
test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the 
quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. 
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine 
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our 
qualitative assessment we considered several factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, 
macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including 
industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected 
financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last 
quantitative assessment. Our annual impairment test in 2022 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our 
wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. 
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which indicated that the fair value of our 
wireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. Our quantitative 
impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated 
carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses 
using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless 
licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no 
assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace 
participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were 
required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability specifically associated with our wireless licenses, 
an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows and assumed terminal value and 
growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless 
network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating 
future cash flows and profitability. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or 
expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate 
based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly, 
our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the 
valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation 
date. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate. 
Goodwill 
At December 31, 2022, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.7 billion, of which $21.1 billion was in our Consumer 
reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit. 
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is 
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative 
assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires 
the fair value of each reporting unit to be assessed. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every 
three years. 
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from 
the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including 
changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA 
margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the 
reporting unit, as well as other factors. 
Under the quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted 
cash flow method, as a form of the income approach. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to 
complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-
projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the 
reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based 
on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The 
discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as 
of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                44 
The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of 
key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to history and market trends and 
expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in the selection of comparable public 
company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies and multiples was influenced by differences in growth and 
profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse 
change in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. 
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit. Our 
qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its 
carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. 
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given it 
has continued to experience increased market pressures resulting in lower than expected revenues and earnings that may 
continue to persist over the near term. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2022, our Business 
reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 8% and, therefore, did not result in an 
impairment. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to change the outcome of the quantitative 
impairment assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis points, or if the discount rate 
increased by 50 basis points, the fair value of our Business reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. However, as a 
result of our 2022 goodwill assessment, management believes there is an increasing risk that our Business reporting unit may be 
required to recognize an impairment charge in the future. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional 
information. 
A projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair 
value and may result in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) decreases in sales 
volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in 
achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term 
interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. 
At December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.6 billion, of which $21.0 billion was in our Consumer 
reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit. We performed quantitative impairment assessments for both 
our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2021. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of 
October 31, 2021, our quantitative assessments indicated that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units 
were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, did not result in impairment. 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit 
plans. Benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination 
of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, 
expense, assets and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for 
pension and other postretirement benefits. 
In determining pension and other postretirement obligations, the weighted-average discount rate was selected to approximate 
the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2022. The 
bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur, were 
non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300 million par outstanding). Bond yields are 
subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit rating downgrades and upgrades, 
government fiscal policy decisions, and general market volatility. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets used in 
determining Verizon’s pension and other postretirement obligations are based on expectations for future investment returns for 
the plans’ asset allocation. The rates are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit 
ratings, monetary policy, inflation, exchange rates, investor behavior and general market volatility. 
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets on the benefit 
obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan 
assets as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is 
provided in the table below. The amounts in the table below related to discount rate changes are gross impacts on benefit 
obligations and expense, and do not reflect changes in asset values as a result of interest rate changes, for which our pension 
plan is highly hedged.

Postretirement plans discount rate +0.50  (507) 
-0.50  552 
Rate of return on postretirement plan assets +1.00  (5) 
-1.00  5 
In addition to our liability hedging assets, we also employ an interest rate hedging strategy to further minimize the impact of 
discount rate changes on the funded ratio of the pension plan. While the target hedge ratio varies depending on the funded 
status of the plan and the level of interest rates, the target hedge ratio was greater than 80% at December 31, 2022, significantly 
limiting volatility. 
The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We use the full yield 
curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. 
The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve 
composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement 
date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a 
more precise estimate of interest cost. 
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Income Taxes 
Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in 
the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and 
rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax 
rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of 
deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to 
be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires 
the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We 
review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and 
information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the 
amounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and 
penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from 
estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax 
balances. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Our Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property, 
plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life 
of the assets. The estimated useful life is subject to change due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or 
performance, technical obsolescence, market expectations and competition impacts. In connection with our ongoing review of 
the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment during 2022, we determined that the estimated useful life of our 
property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our 
property, plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2022 depreciation expense of $2.2 billion and that a one year 
decrease would result in an increase of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2022 depreciation expense. 
Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. 
The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the 
consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our 
customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based 
on management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical 
experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic 
conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future, as applicable. 
The impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance 
for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk 
characteristics.
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                46 
We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan 
agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. 
The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss 
rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and 
used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The 
weighted-average expected loss rate increased 0.44% at December 31, 2022 as compared to at December 31, 2021. We expect 
that an increase or decrease of 0.25% in the weighted-average loss rate would result in a change of $111 million in the 
allowance. 
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are 
disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public 
sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the 
allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account 
from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss 
amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector 
and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual 
customer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above. 
If there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from 
those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the 
adjustments are made. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures 
Spectrum License Transactions 
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license 
transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient 
use of spectrum. 
In March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands 
concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of 
37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive 
payments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon 
amounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses. 
In February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it 
won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is 
required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our allocable share of clearing costs 
incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be 
$7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. 
During 2022, we made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing 
costs. We expect to continue to make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024, which 
we expect to be $4.8 billion. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the 
spectrum for Verizon’s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders’ execution of 
their clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The carrying value 
of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, 
including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders 
associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the 
extent qualifying activities have occurred. 
In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain 
markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022, Verizon incurred costs 
associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which $310 million was paid as of the year ended December 
31, 2022. This early clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key markets to support its 5G 
technology deployment. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our spectrum license transactions. 
TracFone Wireless, Inc. 
In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (TracFone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire 
TracFone, a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021. In 
accordance with the terms of the TracFone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of TracFone's outstanding stock in 
exchange for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, 57,596,544 
shares of our common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent 
   47              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of 
the common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of 
the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $560 million calculated using a probability-weighted 
discounted cash flow model and significant unobservable inputs, thus representing a Level 3 measurement. The contingent 
consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn 
out period, as defined in the TracFone Purchase Agreement. During 2022, Verizon made payments of $188 million related to the 
contingent consideration, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for 
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Payments related to the contingent consideration are expected to continue 
through 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration was $317 million. During 2022, we 
recorded gains of $57 million related to fair value adjustments for the contingent consideration within Selling, general and 
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. See Note 3 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information. 
Bluegrass Cellular 
In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass, a rural wireless operator serving 
central Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the 
transaction was approximately $412 million, net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information. 
Verizon Media Divestiture 
On May 2, 2021, Verizon entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo 
Affiliate) pursuant to which we agreed to sell Verizon Media in return for consideration of $4.3 billion in cash, subject to 
customary adjustments, $750 million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate, and 10% of the 
fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate. 
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value 
of the non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate, and the fair value of 10% of the fully-diluted 
common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate were $4.3 billion, $496 million, and $124 million, respectively. We 
recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax $1.0 billion) in Selling general and administrative expense 
in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $346 million of various 
costs associated with this disposition which are primarily recorded in Selling general and administrative expense in our 
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information. 
Other 
From time to time, we enter into strategic agreements to acquire various other businesses and investments. See Note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
In connection with a non-strategic divestiture and other activity, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of an insignificant amount in our 
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
In December 2021, we completed the sale of an investment. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of 
$131 million in Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated statement of income for the year 
ended December 31, 2021. 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax 
rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency 
swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange 
forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. 
It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary 
to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed 
and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow 
volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would 
completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. 
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements 
(ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA 
agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based 
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair 
value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                48 
the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2022, we did 
not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2022, we posted $2.3 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral 
exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 
2021, we held and posted $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under 
collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities and Prepaid expenses and other, 
respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our 
counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect 
on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the consolidated 
financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio. 
I
nterest Rate Risk 
We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries 
floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 74% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio 
consisted of fixed-rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of 
a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, 
including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $420 million. The interest rates on 
our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings. 
Certain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the 
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. The U.S. dollar LIBOR rates utilized in these transactions will 
cease publication after June 30, 2023, in accordance with recent U.S. and international regulatory guidance for reform. The 
consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate 
debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position 
given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt and taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging. In 2021, we 
began utilizing interest rates that are linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the benchmark rate for various floating 
rate transactions. 
The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap 
derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these 
financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not 
include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in 
market interest rates.

nterest Rate Swaps 
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and 
pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges 
and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. At December 31, 2022, there was no amount related 
to the fair value of the asset and the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $4.6 billion. At December 31, 2021, the fair 
value of the asset and liability of these contracts was $473 million and $666 million, respectively. The increase in the fair value of 
the liability of these contracts is primarily due to interest rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 
31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $26.1 billion and $19.8 billion, respectively . 
Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps 
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to 
interest rate changes on future forecasted transactions. At December 31, 2022, there was no amount related to the fair value of 
the asset or liability of these contracts. At December 31, 2021, there was no amount related to the fair value of the asset and the 
fair value of the liability of these contracts was $302 million. At December 31, 2022, there was no outstanding notional amount for 
forward starting interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2021, the total notional amount of the forward starting interest rate swaps 
was $1.0 billion. 
Treasury Rate Locks 
From time to time we enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. There was no outstanding notional amount 
for treasury rate locks at December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Foreign Currency Translation 
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation of income statement and 
balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are 
included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency 
transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2022, our primary translation exposure 
was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar. 
Cross Currency Swaps 
We have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and 
Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the 
impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. On March 31, 2022, we voluntarily elected to de-designate our cross 
currency swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges and re-designated the swaps as fair value hedges. Subsequently 
executed cross currency swaps are also designated as fair value hedges. The fair value of the asset of these contracts was 
$305 million and $589 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of 
the liability of these contracts was $3.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional 
amount of the cross currency swaps was $35.0 billion and $32.5 billion, respectively. 
Foreign Exchange Forwards 
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge 
accounting. We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk 
related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries. 
At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant. At December 31, 2021, the fair 
value of the asset of these contracts was insignificant and there was no amount related to the liability of these contracts. At 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $920 million and $932 million, 
respectively.

 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.: 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Verizon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Verizon as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
Verizon’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A  company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A  company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.: 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries (Verizon or 
the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verizon at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of Verizon’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
Valuation of Employee Benefit Obligations 
Description of the 
Matter The Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. At 
December 31, 2022, the Company’s aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $15.3 billion and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $13.7 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $1.6 billion. Also, at December 31, 2022, the other postretirement benefits obligation was approximately $11.1 billion. As explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to measure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. 
Auditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rate, health care cost trends and per capita claims cost trends) used in the measurement process. These assumptions had a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation. 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  52 
  
 How We Addressed the 
Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over the employee benefits obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the employee benefit obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuary. 
To test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost trends and per capita claims cost trends, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to management’s actuarial specialists. 
Impairment Evaluation for Verizon Business Group Goodwill 
Description of the 
Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company’s goodwill related to its Verizon Business Group (Business) 
reporting unit was $7.5 billion and represented 2.0% of total assets. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount. 
Auditing management’s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the inherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on assumptions about future conditions, transactions, or events whose outcome is uncertain and will therefore be subject to change over time. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins, which are affected by expected future market or economic conditions. 
How We Addressed the 
Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the valuation models and the significant assumptions described above. 
To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s Business reporting unit, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the suitability and application of the valuation methodologies selected and evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, market information, and other relevant factors. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to determine what changes in assumptions are particularly sensitive when assessing the likelihood of impairment, or when calculating the amount of an impairment. In addition, we involved a valuation specialist to assist in the evaluation of the assumptions and other relevant information that are most significant to the fair value estimate. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts of financial results used in developing prior fair value estimates to assist in evaluating the reliability of the current forecasts.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business 
Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the 
Company, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group 
(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business). 
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand, TracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone) brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. 
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. 
Consolidation 
The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity. Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
Basis of Presentation 
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. 
Use of Estimates 
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related economic implications. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. 
Revenue Recognition 
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprises and government customers. We account for these revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606). 
59             Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 
 
 
 
 We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and 
equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. 
Nature of Products and Services 
Telecommunications 
Service 
We offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). 
For our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs. 
Equipment 
We sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. 
Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). 
Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, typically over a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned. 
A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel. 
Wireless Contracts 
For our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures. 
From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  60 
  
 
 
 is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The 
guarantee liability was $54 million and $77 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside the scope of Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract. 
Our fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed. 
For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability. 
We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may provide credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. 
Wireline Contracts 
Total consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each service. While many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of transaction price and related disclosures. 
We may provide performance-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with our Business customers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. 
Wireless and Wireline Contracts 
For offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or as the agent with respect to the goods or services provided to the customer. This principal-versus-agent assessment involves judgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the arrangement indicate that the goods or services were controlled by us prior to transferring them to the customer. To evaluate if we have control, we consider various factors including whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing. 
Other 
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on the search results page. The divested Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), primarily earned revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party properties through our advertising platforms, search advertising, and subscription arrangements. Revenue for display and search advertising contracts is recognized as ads are delivered, while subscription contracts are recognized over time. We are generally the principal in transactions carried out through our advertising platforms, and therefore report gross revenue based on the amount billed to our customers. The control and transfer of digital advertising inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, where our proprietary technology enables us to identify, enhance, verify and solely control digital advertising inventory that we then sell to our customers. Our control is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers for fulfillment and the fact that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing. We completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media. 
We offer telematics services including smart fleet management and optimization software. Telematics service revenue is generated primarily through subscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts. 
We report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis. 
Maintenance and Repairs 
We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs are incurred. 
61             Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 
 
     
   
   
  
 
 
 Advertising Costs 
Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general 
and administrative expense in the periods in which they are incurred. See Note 15 for additional information. 
Earnings Per Common Share 
Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans. 
There were a total of approximately 1.9 million, 1.7 million and 2.0 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds. 
Cash collections on the receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items in the consolidated balance sheets: 
(dollars in millions) 
At December 31, 2022 2021 Increase / 
(Decrease) 
Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,605 $ 2,921 $ (316) 
Restricted cash: 
Prepaid expenses and other 1,343 1,094 249 
Other assets 163 146 17 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 4,111 $ 4,161 $ (50) 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities 
Investments in equity securities that are not accounted for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be measured at fair value. For investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative permitted under GAAP to measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Allowance for Credit Losses 
Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future, as applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics. 
We pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared risk characteristics of "new customers" and "existing customers." New customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for less than 210 days. Existing customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for 210 days or more. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  62 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are 
disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above. 
Inventories 
Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. 
Plant and Depreciation 
We record property, plant and equipment at cost. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis. 
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset was placed in service. 
When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the property, plant and equipment accounts and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense. 
We capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed within property, plant and equipment assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related assets. 
Computer Software and Cloud Computing Costs 
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and defer the costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that have a useful life and term in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use network and non-network software are capitalized only to the extent that they add significant new functionality. Planning, software maintenance and training costs for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. We capitalize interest associated with the development of internal-use network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 7 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred in implementing a cloud computing arrangement are deferred during the application-development stage and recorded as Prepaid expense and other in our consolidated balance sheets. Once a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, we stop deferring the related cloud computing arrangement costs. 
For a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized non-network software costs, see "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" below. See Note 4 for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Similar to capitalized software costs, deferred costs associated with cloud computing arrangements are subject to impairment testing. 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. 
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. 
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors. 
The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income 
63             Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 
 
 
 
 
 approach) to its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see "Fair 
Value Measurements" discussion below for additional information. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for each of our reporting units. Those plans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. 
See Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing. 
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization 
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. 
We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. 
As part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitative assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests. 
Our quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized. 
Interest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use. 
Wireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets 
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives. 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  64 
 
 See Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as 
the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.
 
Leases 
We lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately, we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use. 
For both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset 
for 
the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the 
lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis. 
In those circumstances where Verizon is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated with our leases (e.g., 
common 
area maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our asset classes. 
Additionally, in arrangements where we are the lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements. 
Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost 
of 
services or Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income, based on the use of the 
facility or equipment on which rent is being paid. Variable rent payments related to both operating and finance leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of payments dependent on various external indicators, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utility usage. 
Operating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets; we recognize rent 
expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 
We recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
lease 
term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset in Depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of 
income. The interest expense related to finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method based on the discount rate determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
See Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). 
Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows: 
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
Level 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy. 
Income Taxes 
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets 
and 
liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and 
liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
65             Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 
   
 
 We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first 
step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability. 
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See Note 10 for additional information. 
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions 
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of Equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of Other income (expense), net. 
Employee Benefit Plans 
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, are accrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional information. 
We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’s funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income tax. 
Derivative Instruments 
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. 
We measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Unrealized gains or losses on excluded components of fair value hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized into earnings on a systematic and rational basis through the swap accrual over the life of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment. 
Cash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the cash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information. 
Variable Interest Entities 
VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  66 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the 
residual returns of the entity. We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) using the modified retrospective approach. The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes made to our consolidated financial statements for the adoption of Topic 326 was as follows: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2019 Adjustments due to 
Topic 326 At January 1, 2020 
Retained earnings $ 53,147  $ (200) $ 52,947  
See Note 8 for additional information related to credit losses, including disclosures required under Topic 326. 
Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs 
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. 
Revenue by Category 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units, Consumer and Business. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services within Consumer, and customer groups (Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale) within Business. See Note 13 for additional information on revenue by segment. Corporate and other primarily includes insurance captive revenues as well as the historical results of divested businesses, including Verizon Media. 
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. As allowed by the practical expedient within Topic 842, we have elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for those arrangements of customer premise equipment where we are the lessor as components accounted for under Topic 606. Revenues from arrangements that were not accounted for under Topic 606 were approximately $3.2 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Remaining Performance Obligations 
When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price may relate to service performance obligations which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose information relating to these unsatisfied performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient available under Topic 606 that provides the option to exclude the expected revenues arising from unsatisfied performance obligations related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This situation primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service contracts. At December 31, 2022, month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 94% of our wireless postpaid contracts and 92% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts, compared to December 31, 2021, for which month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 93% of our wireless postpaid contracts and 86% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts
. 
Additionally, certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fees related to these additional services are recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). 
Contracts for wireless services, with or without promotional credits that require maintenance of service, are generally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time, or considered to contain terms ranging from greater than one month to up to thirty-six months (typically under a device payment plan), or contain terms ranging from greater than one month to up to twenty-four months (typically under a fixed-term plan). Additionally, customers may incur charges based on usage or additional optional services purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. The transaction price allocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not accounted for as month-to-month contracts. 
Our Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wireless service under their own brands to their respective customers. Reseller arrangements generally include a stated contract term, which typically 
67             Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 extends longer than two years and, in some cases, include a periodic minimum revenue commitment over the contract term for 
which revenues will be recognized in future periods. 
Consumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-month; however, they may have a service term of two 
years
 or shorter than twelve months. Certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services extend into future periods, 
contain fixed monthly fees and usage-based fees, and can include annual commitments in each year of the contract or commitments over the entire specified contract term; however, a significant number of contracts for wireline services with our Business customers have a contract term that is twelve months or less. 
Additionally, there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline and telematics services that have a contractual 
minimum 
fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to those 
contracts; thus, they are excluded from the time bands below. These contracts have varying terms spanning over approximately nine years ending in April 2032 and have aggregate contract minimum payments totaling $1.6 billion. 
At December 31, 2022, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are expected to be recognized 
for 
2023, 2024 and thereafter was $22.1 billion, $14.3 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. Remaining performance obligation 
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations and changes in the timing and scope of contracts, arising from contract modifications. 
Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances 
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in our consolidated balance sheets represent an unconditional right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by transferring goods or services to the customer in advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services from the customer, or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract. 
The following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers:

Device payment plan agreement receivables(2) 16,648 12,888 10,358 
(1) Balances do not include receivables related to the following contracts: leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and 
equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment 
financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. 
(2) Included in device payment plan agreement receivables presented in Note 8. Receivables derived from the sale of equipment 
on a device payment plan through an authorized agent are excluded. 
The following table presents information about contract balances:

 At January 1, 
2021 
Contract asset $ 863 $ 934 $ 937 
Contract liability 8,234 7,229  5,598 
Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for goods or services provided to customers but for which we do not 
have an unconditional right at the reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, total contract revenue is allocated between wireless service and equipment revenues. In conjunction with these arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration received from the customer when the performance obligation related to the transfer of control of the equipment is satisfied. The contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless services are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability. 
Contract assets remained relatively flat during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services 
promised 
in the contract. We typically bill service one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability 
balance. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities. 
Contract liabilities increased $1.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in contract liabilities was 
primarily 
due to increases in sales promotions recognized over time and upfront fees. Contract liabilities increased $1.6 billion 
during the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  68 
recognized over time and upfront fees, increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, as well as the acquisition of 
TracFone, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to wireless and Fios services, as well as the sale 
of Verizon Media. 
Revenue recognized during both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to contract liabilities existing at January 
1, 2022 and 2021 were $5.0 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, as performance obligations related to services were satisfied. 
The balance of contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2022 At December 31, 
2021 
Assets 
Prepaid expenses and other $ 656 $ 739 
Other assets  207  195 
Total $ 863 $ 934 
Liabilities 
Other current liabilities $ 6,583 $ 6,053 
Other liabilities  1,651  1,176 
Total $ 8,234 $ 7,229 
Contract Costs 
As discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which 
are then amortized to expense over the respective periods of expected benefit. We recognize an asset for incremental 
commission expenses paid to internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. 
We only defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been incurred 
absent the customer contract and are expected to be recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably 
as commission expense over the period representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain 
wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated device upgrade cycles, as such 
costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over the 
estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to obtain wireline contracts for our 
Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. 
We also defer costs incurred to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that 
will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue 
generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our performance obligations and recorded in 
Cost of services. These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our wireline business resources, such as costs 
incurred to install circuits. 
We determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the 
similarities within these customer contract portfolios. 
Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred. 
Collectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over 
a two-to six-year period. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and 
Other assets, respectively. 
The balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2022 At December 31, 
2021 
Assets 
Prepaid expenses and other $ 2,629 $ 2,432 
Other assets  2,475  2,259 
Total $ 5,104 $ 4,691 
For both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized expense of $3.0 billion associated with the amortization 
of deferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
We assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the 
carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the 
goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have

 not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the years ended December 31, 
2022 and 2021.
 
Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures 
Spectrum License Transactions 
In March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands 
concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of 37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon amounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses. The remaining balance was settled in cash of $1.6 billion. In connection with the incentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion ($914 million after-tax) was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the exchange of the previously held licenses for new licenses had commercial substance. 
In February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it 
won, 
of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is 
required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our allocable share of clearing costs 
incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be $7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. 
During 2022, we made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing 
costs, of which $1.4 billion were accrued as of December 31, 2021 in our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to continue to 
make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024, which we expect to be $4.8 billion. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the spectrum for Verizon’s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders’ execution of their clearing process. In 
accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred. 
In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain 
markets 
and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022, Verizon incurred costs 
associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which $310 million was paid as of December 31, 2022. This early clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key markets to support its fifth-generation (5G) network initiatives. 
During 2022 and 2021, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of an 
insignificant 
amount and $95 million, respectively. During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax loss in connection with the sale of 
certain wireless licenses of $223 million ($167 million after tax). 
Business Acquisitions and Divestitures 
TracFone Wireless, Inc. 
In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (TracFone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire TracFone, a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date). The acquisition positions Verizon as the leading prepaid, value and premium wireless carrier by expanding Verizon’s portfolio, bringing enhanced access of our wireless network and comprehensive suite of mobility products and services to a new customer base. 
In accordance with the terms of the TracFone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of TracFone's outstanding stock in 
exchange 
for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, 57,596,544 
shares of our common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent 
consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of the common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $560 million and represents a Level 3 measurement 
as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. See Note 9 for additional information. The contingent consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn 
out period, as defined in the TracFone Purchase Agreement. 
In May 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $248 million for the final settlement of working capital, which was included in 
our 
consideration as of the Acquisition Date. During 2022, Verizon made payments of $188 million related to the contingent 
consideration, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year 
ended December 31, 2022. In January 2023, we made an additional payment of $102 million related to the contingent 
consideration. Contingent consideration payments are expected to continue through 2024. 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  70 
The TracFone acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase consideration was allocated to the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the Acquisition Date.

Net assets acquired
(1) Adjustments to the fair value measurements reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of 
the Acquisition Date, that if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. The most 
significant adjustments related to goodwill, deferred income taxes, deferred commission costs and other intangible assets. 
During 2022, we recorded a measurement period adjustment resulting in changes to the fair value and amortization period of 
certain intangible assets. As such, we recorded an adjustment to the fair value of certain intangible assets with a corresponding 
adjustment to goodwill. As a result of the changes in the provisional fair value and amortization period of certain intangible assets 
during the one-year measurement period, amortization expense decreased $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Other intangible assets include $2.4 billion related to customer relationships, with a weighted-average amortization period of 7 
years, $1.1 billion related to distribution relationships, with an amortization period of 5 years, $740 million related to trade names 
with a weighted-average amortization period of 17 years and $145 million related to acquired technology, with an amortization 
period of 10 years. The intangible assets were assigned fair values using an income approach. The valuations are considered 
Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant inputs not observable in the market, which include the discount 
rate, royalty rate and amount and timing of future cash flows. 
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration paid and payable and the fair 
value of the net assets acquired, representing future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. 
The goodwill related to this acquisition is included within the Consumer segment. 
Pursuant to the TracFone Purchase Agreement, América Móvil agreed to indemnify Verizon against certain pre-acquisition tax 
matters and other contingencies. We have recorded total contingent liabilities and offsetting indemnification assets of 
$672 million for the expected reimbursement of these matters that had not been resolved as of the Acquisition Date. The 
liabilities are presented in Other liabilities and the indemnification assets are presented in Other assets, within our consolidated 
balance sheets. The amounts recognized represent reasonable estimates based on an evaluation of current facts and 
circumstances. Actual outcome may differ significantly from these estimates. We expect that any additional liabilities that may 
arise related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by América Móvil. 
Bluegrass Cellular 
In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular, a rural wireless operator 
serving central Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing 
of the transaction was approximately $412 million, net of cash acquired.
   71              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Verizon Media Divestiture 
On May 2, 2021, Verizon entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo 
Affiliate) pursuant to which we agreed to sell Verizon Media in return for consideration of $4.3 billion in cash, subject to 
customary adjustments, $750 million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate and 10% of the 
fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate. 
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value 
of the non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate and the fair value of 10% of the fully-diluted 
common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate were $4.3 billion, $496 million, and $124 million, respectively. We 
recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax $1.0 billion) in Selling general and administrative expense 
in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $346 million of various 
costs associated with this disposition which are primarily recorded in Selling general and administrative expense in our 
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
During 2022 and 2021, the Apollo Affiliate redeemed $37 million and $100 million, respectively, of Verizon’s preferred limited 
partnership interest reducing the carrying value of our preferred interest as of December 31, 2022 to $359 million. The 
redemptions are reflected within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years 
ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Verizon’s 10% common interest in the Apollo Affiliate is 
accounted for as an equity method investment. The post-sale results of Verizon’s common ownership interest in the Apollo 
Affiliate are recorded through the equity method of accounting, within Corporate and other. 
In connection with the closing of the transaction, we entered into Transition Services Agreements with the Apollo Affiliate, under 
which Verizon will continue to provide and receive specified technical services to support operations for up to 18 months. 
Under our ownership, Verizon Media generated revenues from contracts with customers under Topic 606 of approximately 
$5.3 billion and $7.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflected within our Corporate and 
Other segment. 
Other 
During 2022 and 2021, we completed various other acquisitions for cash consideration of an insignificant amount and 
approximately $51 million, respectively. 
In connection with a non-strategic divestiture and other activity we recorded a pre-tax net gain of an insignificant amount in our 
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
In December 2021, we completed the sale of an investment. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of 
$131 million in Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated statement of income for the year 
ended December 31, 2021. 
Note 4. Wireless Licenses, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
Wireless Licenses 
The carrying amounts of Wireless licenses are as follows: 
(dollars in millions) 
At December 31, 2022 2021 
Wireless licenses $ 149,796 $ 147,619 
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $41.7 billion and $54.9 billion, respectively, of wireless licenses were under 
development for commercial service for which we were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $1.7 billion and 
$1.6 billion of capitalized interest on wireless licenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
During 2022 and 2021, we renewed various wireless licenses in accordance with FCC regulations with an average renewal 
period of 15 years and 11 years, respectively. See Note 1 for additional information. 
As discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment 
indicators are present. In 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment, which indicated it was more likely than not 
that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying amount and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. 
In 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment test, which compared the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless 
licenses, estimated using the Greenfield approach, to the aggregated carrying amount of the licenses as of the test date. Our 
annual assessment in 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did 
not result in an impairment.
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                72 
Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, 
provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our 
networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities.

(1) Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment charges of $4.8 billion, related to our historical Media reporting unit, which included 
Verizon Media. On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. See Note 3 for additional information. 
(2) Changes in goodwill due to acquisitions is related to TracFone, Bluegrass and other insignificant transactions. See Note 3 for 
additional information. 
(3) Changes in goodwill due to acquisitions is related to TracFone. See Note 3 for additional information. 
(4) Includes a goodwill impairment charge of $16 million related to an early stage development company presented within Other, 
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 
31, 2022. 
We performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2022. Our 
qualitative impairment assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit 
exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. 
We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2022. We 
applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach, reflecting 
current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which indicated that 
the fair value of our Business reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. We do not 
anticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to change the outcome of the quantitative impairment assessment. 
However, as a result of our 2022 goodwill assessment, management believes there is an increasing risk that our Business 
reporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the future. 
A projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair 
value and may result in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) decreases in sales 
volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in 
achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term 
interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. 
We performed quantitative impairment assessments for both our Consumer and Business reporting units in 2021. We applied a 
combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach, which indicated that 
the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an 
impairment.

Note 6. Leasing Arrangements 
We enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real 
estate and connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our 
leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend 
the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered 
into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the 
lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these 
options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. 
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American 
Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                74 
$5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates 
in 2015, with options to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property, plant and equipment, net in our consolidated 
balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. In addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, American Tower 
assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers. While American Tower can renegotiate the terms of 
and is responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the primary obligor for these leases and accordingly, the present 
value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. We do not 
expect to be required to make ground lease payments unless American Tower defaults, which we determined to be remote.

operating leases and small cell colocation and fiber operating leases that have not yet commenced. We have legally obligated 
lease payments for various other operating leases that have not yet commenced for which the total obligation was not significant. 
We have certain rights and obligations for these leases, but have not recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset or an 
operating lease liability since they have not yet commenced.

(1) The debt obligations bore interest at a floating rate based on the Compounded Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for 
the interest period or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable interest margin per annum, as applicable. 
Compounded SOFR is calculated using the SOFR Index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in accordance 
with the formula set forth in the terms of the notes. The Compounded SOFR for the interest period ending in December 2022 
was 3.450%. The one-month and three-month LIBOR at December 31, 2022 was 4.392% and 4.767%, respectively. 
(2) The debt obligations bore interest at floating rates, including floating rates associated with SOFR for the interest period, or 
LIBOR plus an applicable interest margin per annum, as applicable. Floating rates associated with SOFR for the interest 
period ending in December 2022 ranged from 3.807% to 4.372%.

During 2022, we received $17.8 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $10.7 billion of proceeds from 
asset-backed debt transactions. The net proceeds were primarily used for general corporate purposes including the repayment 
of debt and the funding of certain renewable energy projects. We used $13.6 billion of cash to repay, redeem and repurchase 
long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, including $4.9 billion to prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term 
borrowings. The net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion from the green bond issued in 2022 are expected to be used to fund 
certain renewable energy projects. 
During 2021, we received $41.4 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $8.4 billion of proceeds from 
asset-backed debt transactions. The net proceeds were primarily used to finance the purchase of wireless licenses won in 
connection with the FCC's auction for C-Band wireless spectrum, Auction 107, and fund certain renewable energy projects. We 
   77              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
used 
$18.9 billion of cash to repay, redeem and repurchase long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, including 
$4.8 billion to prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term borrowings. The net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion from the 
green bond issued in 2021 were used to fund certain renewable energy projects.

Short-term Borrowing and Commercial Paper Program 
In March 2022, we entered into and fully drew from a $1.0 billion short-term uncommitted credit facility. In December 2022, we 
fully repaid $1.0 billion under the short-term uncommitted credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had no short-term 
borrowing outstanding. 
In 2022, we issued $27.4 billion in commercial paper and we repaid $27.3 billion of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2022, 
we had $150 million of commercial paper outstanding. These transactions are reflected within Cash flows from financing 
activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Asset-Backed Debt 
As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $20.0 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-
Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks 
and their conduit facilities (collectively, the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, 
an ABS Entity or collectively, the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                78 
connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership (Cellco), a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain other Company affiliates (collectively, the Originators) transfer device 
payment plan agreement receivables and certain other receivables (collectively referred to as certain receivables) to one of the 
ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities retain the 
equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to 
make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses. 
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and future collections on such receivables. These receivables 
transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of 
asset-backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of certain 
receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other 
obligations or claims of Verizon’s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The 
Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do 
not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support 
agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS 
Entities. 
Cash collections on the receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be 
placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in 
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated 
statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our 
consolidated balance sheets.

Under the terms of each series of ABS Notes, there is a revolving period of 18 months, two years or up to three years, as 
applicable, during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we 
made aggregate principal repayments of $4.3 billion on ABS Notes that have entered the amortization period, including principal 
payments made in connection with clean-up redemptions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made aggregate 
principal repayments of $3.3 billion on ABS Notes that had entered the amortization period, including principal payments made in 
connection with clean-up redemptions. 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                80 
In January 2023, we issued $932 million aggregate principal amount of ABS Notes, with a blended interest rate of approximately 
4.511%, through an ABS Entity. 
ABS Financing Facilities 
Under the two loan agreements in connection with the ABS Financing Facility entered into in December 2021 (2021 ABS 
Financing Facility), we prepaid an aggregate of $515 million in January 2022, borrowed an additional $1.9 billion in March 2022, 
prepaid an aggregate of $130 million in May 2022 and borrowed an additional $545 million in June 2022. In December 2022, we 
renewed the loan agreements in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing Facility which reset the revolving period of one or two 
years, as applicable, and we borrowed an additional $1.9 billion. The aggregate outstanding balance under the 2021 ABS 
Financing Facility was $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
In October 2022, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a financial institution (2022 ABS Financing Facility). Under the 
terms of the 2022 ABS Financing Facility, the financial institution makes advances under asset-backed loans backed by certain 
wireless service accounts receivables of both Consumer customers and Business customers. The loan agreement entered into 
in connection with the 2022 ABS Financing Facility is outstanding with a final maturity date in June 2024 and the loan agreement 
bears interest at a floating rate. There is an 18 month revolving period, as set forth in the loan agreement, which may be 
extended with the approval of the financial institution. Under the loan agreement, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of 
the advances at any time without penalty, but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also 
remove receivables from the applicable ABS Entity. In October 2022, we borrowed $2.0 billion under the loan agreement entered 
into in connection with the 2022 ABS Financing Facility. The aggregate outstanding balance under the 2022 ABS Financing 
Facility was $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
Variable Interest Entities 
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have both 
the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s performance and the obligation to absorb 
losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity. Therefore, the assets, liabilities and activities of the ABS Entities are 
consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets. 
The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated balance sheets were as 
follows:

(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it 
permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the 
issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no drawings against the $9.5 billion revolving credit 
facility since its inception. 
(2) During 2022 and 2021, we drew down $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, from these facilities. Borrowings under certain 
of these facilities are amortized semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect 
maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot 
be reborrowed. 
In January 2023, we submitted an irrevocable request to borrow approximately $515 million from funds available under our 
export credit facilities in March 2023. 
Non-Cash Transactions 
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we financed, primarily through alternative financing arrangements, 
the purchase of approximately $832 million, $461 million, and $1.7 billion, respectively, of long-lived assets consisting primarily of 
network equipment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, relating to these financing 
arrangements, including those entered into in prior years and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained outstanding. 
These purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore are not reflected within Capital expenditures in our consolidated 
statements of cash flows.

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net debt extinguishment losses of $1.1 billion, 
$3.6 billion and $121 million, respectively. The net losses are recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated 
statements of income. The total losses are reflected within Other, net cash flow from operating activities and the portion of the 
losses representing cash payments are reflected within Other, net cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated 
statements of cash flows.  
Guarantees 
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, $614 million 
aggregate principal amount of these obligations remained outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the 
obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company no longer being a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Company. 
Debt Covenants 
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

insignificant. 
Included in Other assets and Accounts receivable, net at December 31, 2022 are net device payment plan agreement 
receivables and net wireless service receivables of $23.6 billion, which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                82 
reported in our consolidated balance sheet. Included in Other assets and Accounts receivable, net at December 31, 2021, are 
net device payment plan agreement receivables of $16.0 billion, which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be 
reported in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 for additional information. We believe the carrying value of these 
receivables approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model. 
Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment 
plan agreement. Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program pay lower service 
fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge is included on their wireless 
monthly bill. We no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue 
to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers.  We also continue to service existing plans for customers who have not yet 
purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device payment program. 
Wireless Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables

Device payment plan agreement receivables, net $ 24,828 $ 20,186   
  
  
  
(1) Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables. 
For indirect channel wireless contracts with customers, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement 
receivables. We record the imputed interest as a reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included 
within Service revenues and other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over the financed device payment 
term. 
Promotions 
In connection with certain device payment plan agreements, we may offer a promotion to allow our customers to upgrade to a 
new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required device payment plan agreement amount as well as 
trading in their device in good working order. When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to 
upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. We recognize a liability measured at fair 
value for the customer’s right to trade in the device which is determined by considering several factors, including the weighted-
average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 
2021, the amount of the guarantee liability was $54 million and $77 million, respectively. 
We may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new 
device. Under these types of promotions, the customer receives a credit for the value of the trade-in device. At December 31, 
2022 and December 31, 2021, the amount of trade-in liability was $562 million and $366 million, respectively. 
In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied against the customer’s monthly 
bill as long as service is maintained. These future billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and 
are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability. 
Device payment plan agreement receivables, net, does not reflect the trade-in liability, additional future credits or the guarantee 
liability. 
Origination of Device Payment Plan Agreements 
When originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to 
measure the credit quality of a customer and to determine eligibility for the device payment program. Verizon’s experience has 
been that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future 
payments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and 
receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than receivables from customers that have not 
previously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make initial lending decisions based upon whether the 
customers are "established customers" or "short-tenured customers." If a Consumer customer has been a customer for 45 days 
   83              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an "established 
customer." For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of 
internal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has 
been a customer for less than 12 months, the customer is considered a "short-tenured customer." For short-tenured customers, 
the credit decision and credit monitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources. 
Available external credit data from credit reporting agencies along with internal data are used to create custom credit risk scores 
for Consumer customers. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’s credit data using 
proprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely 
delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit 
report is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient 
credit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify 
the existence of the business with external data sources. 
Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit. This 
includes an account level spending limit and a maximum amount of credit allowed per device for Consumer customers or a 
required down payment percentage for Business customers. 
Credit Quality Information 
Subsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two 
models, one for new customers and one for existing customers. The model for new customers pools all Consumer and Business 
wireless customers based on less than 210 days as "new customers." The model for existing customers pools all Consumer and 
Business wireless customers based on 210 days or more as "existing customers." 
The following table presents device payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost, as of December 31, 2022, by credit 
quality indicator and year of origination:

(1) Includes accounts that have been suspended at a point in time. 
The data presented in the table above was last updated on December 31, 2022. 
We assess indicators for the quality of our wireless service receivables portfolio as one overall pool. As of December 31, 2022, 
wireless service receivables, at amortized cost, originating in 2022 and 2021 were $5.1 billion and $58 million, respectively. 
Allowance for Credit Losses 
The credit quality indicators are used in determining the estimated amount and the timing of expected credit losses for the device 
payment plan agreement and wireless service receivables portfolios. 
For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our 
proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as 
noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then 
aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining 
the allowance balance. 
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are 
disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public 
sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the 
allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account 
from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and is adjusted based on the 
historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global 
enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off 
experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable.

(1) Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables. 
We monitor delinquency and write-off experience based on the quality of our device payment plan agreement and wireless 
service receivables portfolios. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of 
our proprietary custom internal scoring models that analyze the customer’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the 
customer falling further delinquent. These custom scoring models assess a number of variables, including origination 
characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. Since our customers’ behaviors may be impacted by general 
economic conditions, we analyzed whether changes in macroeconomic conditions impact our credit loss experience and have 
concluded that our credit loss estimates are generally not materially impacted by reasonable and supportable forecasts of future 
economic conditions. Based on the score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the 
collection strategy to be applied to such accounts. For device payment plan agreement receivables and wireless service 
receivables, we consider an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are unpaid charges remaining on the account 
on the day after the bill’s due date. The risk class determines the speed and severity of the collections effort including initiatives 
taken to facilitate customer payment.

Certain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from the tables above. Such 
investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in 
orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated 
businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of our 
investments without readily determinable fair values was $804 million and $808 million, respectively. During 2022, there were 
insignificant adjustments due to observable price changes and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to 
observable price changes and impairment charges were approximately $176 million and $82 million, respectively. 
Verizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of TracFone, completed in November 2021. The fair 
value is calculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 
instruments include valuation based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably 
available assumptions made by other market participants. Subsequent to the Acquisition Date, at each reporting date, the 
contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair value. During 2022, we recorded gains of $57 million related to fair value 
adjustments for the contingent consideration within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of 
income. During 2022, we made payments of $188 million related to the contingent consideration. In January 2023, we made an 
additional payment of $102 million related to the contingent consideration. See Note 3 for additional information. 
Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income securities is based 
on the quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from 
observable market data. The valuation determines that these securities are classified as Level 2. 
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our 
derivative contracts and thus are classified within Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our 
derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis. 
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period.

Fair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt 
The fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical debt instruments, which is a 
Level 1 measurement, as well as quoted prices for similar debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities, which is a 
Level 2 measurement. 
The fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was as follows:

Derivative Instruments 
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest 
rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and 
foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Swaps 
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and 
pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges 
and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our 
consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded to Interest 
expense, which are primarily offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates. 
Cross Currency Swaps 
We have entered into cross currency swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges through March 31, 2022 to exchange our 
British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to 
fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A portion 
of the loss recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) was reclassified to Interest expense to offset the related pre-tax 
foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item. 
On March 31, 2022, we elected to de-designate our cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges and re-designated these swaps 
as fair value hedges. For these hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the cross currency swaps related 
to both time value and cross currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (the excluded components). The 
initial value of the excluded components of $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 will continue to be amortized into Interest expense 
over the remaining life of the hedging instruments. We estimate that $109 million will be amortized into Interest expense within 
the next 12 months. 
In addition to the previously mentioned cross currency swaps, we have executed additional cross currency swaps to exchange 
Euro-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars. These swaps are designated as fair 
value hedges. We record the cross currency swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. 
Changes in the fair value of the cross currency swaps attributable to changes in the spot rate of the hedged item and changes in 
the recorded value of the hedged debt due to changes in spot rates are recorded in the same income statement line item. We 
present exchange gains and losses from the conversion of foreign currency denominated debt as a part of Interest expense. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, these amounts completely offset each other and no net gain or loss was recorded. 
Changes in the fair value of cross currency swaps attributable to time value and cross currency basis spread are initially 
recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains or losses on excluded components are recorded in Other 
comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized into Interest expense on a systematic and rational basis through the swap 
accrual over the life of the hedging instrument. The amount remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash 
flow hedges on the date of transition will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings or when it 
becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the amortization of 
the initial value of the excluded component completely offset the amortization related to the amount remaining in Other 
comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges. See Note 14 for additional information. 
Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps 
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to 
interest rate changes on future forecasted transactions. We hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows based on 
the expected maturities of the related forecasted debt issuance. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate 
movements in Other comprehensive income (loss). 
   89              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Treasury Rate Locks 
We have entered into treasury rate locks designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate our interest rate risk on future transactions. 
We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in Other comprehensive income (loss). 
Net Investment Hedges 
We have designated certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure 
related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. The notional 
amount of Euro-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge was €750 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 
2021. 
Undesignated Derivatives 
We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply 
hedge accounting. 
The following table summarizes the activity of our derivatives not designated in hedging relationships:

Swaptions 
We enter into swaptions to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term 
and long-term investments, trade receivables, including device payment plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, 
including lease receivables, and derivative contracts. 
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements 
(ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA 
agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based 
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair 
value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or 
the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2022, we did 
not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2022, we posted $2.3 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral 
exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 
2021, we held and posted $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under 
collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities and Prepaid expenses and other, 
respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our 
counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect 
on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. 
Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation 
Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan 
In May 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated the Company's 
authority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for 
broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock 
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                90 
approval of the 2017 Plan, we reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not 
issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise 
terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares are reserved for 
future issuance under the 2017 Plan. 
Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the 
grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant 
date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled 
in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs 
granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent 
the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In 
2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan 
to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. 
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those 
estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock 
units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
Performance Stock Units 
The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after 
the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of 
PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-
year performance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using 
the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that 
are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, 
therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. All PSUs 
granted under the 2017 Plan have DEUs, which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award 
vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled 
activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.

As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’s RSUs and PSUs 
was approximately $604 million and is expected to be recognized over approximately 2 years. 
The equity awards granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $53.26, $55.39 and $57.38 
per unit, respectively. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid $433 million, $986 million and $961 million, respectively, to settle 
RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards. 
Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
After-tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs and PSUs described above included in Net 
income attributable to Verizon was $609 million, $625 million and $780 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Note 11. Employee Benefits 
We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. In addition, we maintain postretirement health 
care and life insurance plans for certain retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory, and 
include a limit on our share of the cost for certain current and future retirees. In accordance with our accounting policy for 
pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include service costs associated with pension and other 
postretirement benefits while other credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an 
estimated return on plan assets, and impact from health care trend rates are reported in Other income (expense), net. These 
estimates are updated in the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event, to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated 
actuarial assumptions. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement 
event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses. 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in 
benefits have been bargained from time to time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The 
following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and rate assumptions 
associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

Actuarial Gain, Net 
The net actuarial gain in 2022 is primarily the result of a $7.0 billion gain ($4.1 billion gain in the pension plan and $2.9 billion 
gain in our postretirement benefit plans) due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year 
liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021 to a 
weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022. 
The net actuarial gain in 2021 is primarily the result of a $1.1 billion gain due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used 
to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.6% at 
December 31, 2020 to a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021. 
Plan Amendments 
In July 2022, union members ratified the extension of our collective bargaining agreements with the Communications Workers of 
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for three years, from August 5, 2023 until August 1, 2026. 
Amendments triggered by the collective bargaining negotiations were made to certain pension plans for certain union-
represented employees. The impact of the plan amendments was an increase in our defined benefit pension plans plan 
obligations of approximately $427 million, which has been recorded as a net decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) of $317 million (net of taxes of $110 million). The annual impact of the amount recorded in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) that will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is minimal. 
The reclassifications from the amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of collective 
bargaining agreements and plan amendments made in 2016, 2017 and 2018 resulted in a net decrease to net periodic benefit 
cost and net increase to pre-tax income of approximately $390 million during 2022 and $708 million during 2021 and 2020.

In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 5.2% in 
2022. The rates were selected to approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds 
available in the market at December 31, 2022. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during 
which benefits payments are expected to occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at 
least $300 million par outstanding). 
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each 
major asset class over the subsequent 10-year period. Those estimates are based on a combination of factors including the 
current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To 
determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted 
according to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’s long-term asset allocation policy. 
The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows: 
Health Care and Life 
At December 31, 2022 2021 2020 
Weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year  6.60 %  6.20 %  6.20 % 
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines  4.50  4.50  4.50 
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter 2031 2029 2029 
Plan Assets 
The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while 
taking into consideration risk and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for 
plan assets is designed so that 41% to 51% of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in 
liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emerging market debt) 
and 55% to 65% of the assets are invested as liability hedging assets (where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging 
assets better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability) and a maximum of 10% is in cash. This allocation will shift as 
funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to ensure 
they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market 
efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control processes, there are no significant 
concentrations of risk, in terms of sector, industry, geography or company names. 
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of Verizon bonds or common stock.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine 
the fair value of each major category of assets. 
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), primarily in diversified portfolios 
of investment grade money market instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The 
carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. 
Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale 
prices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government 
obligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from 
independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and 
ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable 
such as multiple broker quotes. 
Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value 
(NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. 
The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. 
The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership 
investments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real 
estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by 
mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned 
to these investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that 
might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from 
the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material. 
Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on 
the last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These 
securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings. 
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager. These funds are 
valued in accordance with the terms of their corresponding offering or private placement memoranda.
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                96 
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limited partnership 
investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair 
value hierarchy but are included in total investments. 
Employer Contributions 
In 2022, we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $53 million of contributions to our nonqualified 
pension plans and $692 million of contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans. No mandatory qualified pension plans 
contributions are expected or required to be made in 2023. In 2023, we expect discretionary qualified pension plan contributions 
to be approximately $200 million, nonqualified pension plan contributions are estimated to be insignificant and contributions to 
our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $820 million. 
Estimated Future Benefit Payments 
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:

Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans 
We maintain four leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee 
contributions to certain savings plans with shares of our common stock from this ESOP. At December 31, 2022, the number of 
allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 43 million. There were no unallocated shares of common stock in this ESOP 
at December 31, 2022. All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations. 
Total savings plan costs were $620 million in 2022, $690 million in 2021 and $730 million in 2020.

Severance, Pension and Benefits (Credits) Charges 
During 2022, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, 
we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $1.7 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits 
were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of 
$7.0 billion due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans 
($4.1 billion) and postretirement benefit plans ($2.9 billion) from a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021 to a 
weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022, a charge of $5.5 billion due to the difference between our estimated and our 
actual return on assets and a credit of $206 million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 2022, we also 
recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $319 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated 
statements of income. 
During 2021, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.4 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. 
The credits were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by 
a credit of $1.1 billion due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our 
pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020 to a weighted-average 
of 2.9% at December 31, 2021, a credit of $847 million due to the difference between our estimated and our actual return on 
assets and a credit of $453 million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 2021, we also recorded net pre-tax 
severance charges of $233 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
   97              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
During 2020, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits charges of $1.6 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit 
plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily 
driven by a charge of $3.2 billion due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities 
of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 to a weighted-
average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020, partially offset by a credit of $1.6 billion due to the difference between our estimated and 
our actual return on assets. During 2020, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $309 million in Selling, general and 
administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
Note 12. Taxes 
The components of income before provision for income taxes are as follows: 
(dollars in millions) 
Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 
Domestic $ 26,822 $ 27,607 $ 22,844

The following table shows the principal reasons for the difference between the effective income tax rate and the statutory federal 
income tax rate: 
Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 
Statutory federal income tax rate  21.0 %  21.0 %  21.0 % 
State and local income tax rate, net of federal tax benefits  3.9  3.8  3.9 
Noncontrolling interest  (0.4)  (0.4)  (0.5) 
Divestitures  —  (0.6)  0.1 
Tax credits  (0.5)  (0.5)  (0.8) 
Other, net  (0.9)  (0.2)  (0.3) 
Effective income tax rate  23.1 %  23.1 %  23.4 % 
The effective income tax rate for 2022 and 2021 was 23.1%. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended 
December 31, 2022 was comparable to the similar period in 2021. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily 
due to the decrease in income before income taxes in the current period. 
The effective income tax rate for 2021 was 23.1% compared to 23.4% for 2020. The decrease in the effective income tax rate 
was primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021, partially offset by the non-recurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a 
series of legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income 
before income taxes in 2021. 
The amounts of cash taxes paid by Verizon are as follows: 
(dollars in millions) 
Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
Deferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Significant components of 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 
(dollars in millions) 
At December 31, 2022 2021 
Deferred Tax Assets 
Employee benefits $ 3,888 $ 4,388 
Tax loss, credit, and other carry forwards 1,940 2,224 
Other - assets 6,986 7,314 
12,814 13,926 
Valuation allowances (1,347) (1,574) 
Deferred tax assets 11,467 12,352 
Deferred Tax Liabilities 
Spectrum and other intangible amortization 25,851 24,935 
Depreciation 21,388 19,893 
Other - liabilities 7,496 8,041 
Deferred tax liabilities 54,735 52,869 
Net deferred tax liability $ 43,268 $ 40,517   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
At December 31, 2022, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. amounted to 
approximately $2.5 billion. The majority of Verizon's cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent 
on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings 
to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in 
reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation. As a 
result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain 
indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of the 
amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable. 
At December 31, 2022, we had net after-tax loss, credit, and other carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately 
$1.9 billion that relate to federal, state and foreign taxes. Of these net after-tax loss, credit, and other carry forwards, 
approximately $1.2 billion will expire between 2023 and 2042 and approximately $732 million may be carried forward indefinitely. 
During 2022, the valuation allowance decreased approximately $227 million. The $1.3 billion valuation allowance at December 
31, 2022, as well as the 2022 activity is primarily related to state and foreign taxes. 
Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 
(dollars in millions) 
2022 2021 2020 
Balance at January 1, $ 3,134 $ 2,944 $ 2,870 
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 123 150 160 
Additions for tax positions of prior years 122 621 258 
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (419) (330) (166) 
Settlements (92) (163) (46) 
Lapses of statutes of limitations (56) (88) (132) 
Balance at December 31, $ 2,812 $ 3,134 $ 2,944    
   
   
   
   
Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is $2.5 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, 
respectively, that if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate. 
We recognized the following net after-tax expenses (benefit) related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes: 
Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions)

2021 (21) 
2020 5  
 
   99              Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
The after-tax accruals for the payment of interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows: 
At December 31, (dollars in millions) 
2022 $ 544 
2021 551  
The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily related to the resolution of issues with the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) involving tax years 2015-2016 as well as final purchase accounting adjustments made in connection with the 2021 
acquisition of TracFone. The uncertain tax benefits related to the acquisition of TracFone are the subject of an indemnity from 
América Móvil for which there is a corresponding indemnity asset. 
Verizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign 
jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, we are under audit by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax 
years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2017-2018 and Cellco's U.S. income 
tax return for tax years 2017-2019. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2009 in certain states and as early as 
2000 outside the U.S. The amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the 
expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax examinations 
will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible 
change cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.  
Note 13. Segment Information 
Reportable Segments 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We 
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision 
maker’s assessment of segment performance. 
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following: 
Segment Description 
Verizon 
Consumer Group Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the Verizon brand, TracFone brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. 
Verizon Business Group Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. 
Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers 
that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products 
and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small and Medium Business, Global 
Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. 
Corporate and other primarily includes insurance captives, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage 
businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee 
benefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested 
businesses including Verizon Media, and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment 
performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included 
in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in 
segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. 
We completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon 
Media.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022, 
2021 and 2020. International operating revenues were not significant during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 
2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, international long-lived assets were not significant. 
The chief operating decision maker does not review disaggregated assets on a segment basis; therefore, such information is not 
presented. Depreciation and amortization included in the measure of segment profitability is primarily allocated based on 
proportional usage, and is included within Total reportable segment operating income.   
Note 14. Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
Equity 
Common Stock 
In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million 
shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million 
or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. During the years ended 
December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our authorized share 
buyback program. At December 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon 
under our share buyback program was 100 million. 
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. 
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we issued 2.1 million, 2.1 million and 2.3 million shares of common 
stock from treasury stock, which had aggregate values of $91 million, $91 million and $101 million, respectively.
 
In connection with our acquisition of TracFone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of our common 
stock from treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion. See Note 3 for additional information. 
Noncontrolling Interests 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, Verizon entered into and completed agreements to acquire additional interests in 
certain controlled wireless partnerships for cash consideration of $508 million. Verizon continues to retain controlling financial 
interest within these partnerships; therefore, the changes in ownership interest were accounted for as equity transactions. This 
resulted in a reduction of additional paid-in capital of $450 million, reflected in Other, and a reduction of noncontrolling interest of 
$58 million, reflected in Distributions and other, both within our consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 
December 31, 2022. These transactions were recorded within Other, net cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated 
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies 
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state 
and federal level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is 
probable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount 
of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued 
cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and 
demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or 
regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings 
as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending 
regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect 
on our results of operations for a given reporting period. 
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 25 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. 
Most of these cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are 
brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well. These cases have progressed to various 
stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. 
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides 
representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the 
securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims 
under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of 
business. 
As of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $834 million, which were executed in the normal course of 
business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. 
During 2022, Verizon entered into four renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 20 
signed in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and 
has a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Seven of the 
facilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are expected 
to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities. 
We have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are 
enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of 
one year, total $24.5 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, 
content, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of 
suppliers. Of this total amount, $9.4 billion is attributable to 2023, $6.9 billion is attributable to 2024, $5.5 billion is attributable to 
2025, $1.4 billion is attributable to 2026, $772 million is attributable to 2027 and $524 million is attributable to years thereafter. 
These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the 
Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                106 
subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities to which 
we are contractually obliged. Since the commitments to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast 
stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 
2022, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed 
with no firm commitment. 
Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
None. 
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the 
period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in 
this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal 
control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded 
that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes 
to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, 
we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of 
our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data 
analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. 
As the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures 
which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate 
quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
There were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2022 that have materially 
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting of Verizon. Management has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of Verizon using the criteria for 
effective internal control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. 
Management has assessed the effectiveness of Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
Based on this assessment, management believes that the internal control over financial reporting of Verizon is effective as of 
December 31, 2022. In connection with this assessment, there were no material weaknesses in Verizon’s internal control over 
financial reporting identified by management. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, 
has provided an attestation report on Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting and is included in Item 8 of this Annual 
Report.
