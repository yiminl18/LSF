PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. 
We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, 
enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and 
experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers 
through our sales force and certain local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website 
at www .adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model 
(both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per -use models. We also 
distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators 
(“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). 
In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their 
products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server -based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other 
devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-
Pacific (“AP AC”). See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographical information.
 Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our 
executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number

BUSINESS OVER VIEW
 
 For over 35 years, Adobe’ s innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments interact. 
We help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in a streamlined workflow , and optimize those 
experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across 
media and devices, anytime, anywhere.
 While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services, and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic 
growth areas:
 Digital Media—providing products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish 
and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, web designers, app developers and digital media 
professionals, as well as management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also 
include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. This is the core of what we have delivered for over 
25 years, and we have evolved our business model to provide our customers with a range of flexible solutions that allow them to 
reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device on projects of all types. 
 Digital Experience—providing solutions and services for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital 
marketing and advertising campaigns across multiple channels. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, 
Table of Contents
4merchandisers, web analysts, marketing executives, information management executives, product development executives, and 
sales and support executives. In fiscal 2017, we processed 186 trillion data transactions with our analytics products, providing our 
customers with a robust data platform that can be used to gain insight and optimize digital experiences delivered with our Adobe 
Experience Cloud solutions. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience 
offerings, we help our customers more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every 
channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
 We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience markets, where our 
mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these two areas of Adobe’ s 
business, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. 
In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, 
management, delivery , measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue 
investing in engaging their constituents digitally .
SEGMENTS
 Effective in fiscal 2018, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience (formerly 
Digital Marketing), and Publishing (formerly Print and Publishing). These segments provide Adobe’ s senior management with a 
comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities 
described above, placing our Publishing business in a third segment that contains some of our mature products and solutions.
 This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2018 and beyond 
for each of our segments. See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations”  and Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment 
information.
MARKET  OVER VIEW
Digital Media
Digital Media Opportunity
 Recent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in 
digital media. In today’ s world where the velocity of creation and consumption of digital content is ever increasing, customers are 
looking for a way to meet demand with engaging online experiences. Adobe is in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity 
by driving modernization and innovation that will accelerate the creative process across all platforms and devices, deepen 
engagement with communities, and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed 
on a subscription basis.
 The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud—a subscription service that allows members to use 
Adobe’ s creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices.  Creative Cloud 
members can download and access the latest versions of our creative products such as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Premiere 
Pro CC, Lightroom CC, InDesign CC, Adobe XD CC and many more creative applications.  In addition, members can access 
built-in templates to jumpstart designs and step-by-step tutorials to sharpen skills and get up to speed quickly . Through Creative 
Cloud, members can access online services to sync, store, and share files across users’  machines, access marketplace, social and 
community-based features within our Adobe Stock and Behance services, and create apps and websites, all at affordable subscription 
pricing for cost-sensitive customers. 
 Adobe continues to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud so that our customers can obtain everything they need 
to create, collaborate and be inspired. A core part of our strategy is Adobe Sensei, a proprietary framework and set of intelligent 
services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages Adobe’ s massive 
content and data assets, as well as its deep domain expertise in the creative, marketing and document segments, within a unified 
artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning framework to tackle today’ s complex creative experience challenges.
 Creative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals such as artists, designers, developers, students and 
administrators. They rely on our products for publishing, web design and development, video and animation production, mobile 
app and gaming development, and document creation and collaboration. End users of our creative products work in businesses 
ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies, and individual freelancers. 
Moreover , our creative products are used to create much of the printed and online information people see, read and interact with 
every day, including video, animation, mobile and advertising content. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and consumers 
Table of Contents
5also use our products to create and deliver content. We have introduced new products, features and services to address emer ging 
categories of content creation such as 3D, augmented reality , virtual reality and user experience design. New solutions include 
Adobe Dimension, a tool that enables the creation of high-quality , photorealistic 3D images; Adobe XD, a solution for creating 
user experiences and screen designs as part of designing websites and mobile apps; and Adobe Spark, a set of capabilities that 
enables anyone to create impactful graphics, web pages and video stories in minutes.
 Adobe’ s Digital Media segment includes our Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of products, the 
Adobe Acrobat Reader and a set of integrated, cloud-based document services.  Tens of millions of knowledge workers worldwide 
interact with documents daily .  For over 25 years, Adobe Acrobat has provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic 
documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Users can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and 
tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing 
our free Adobe Acrobat Reader . Acrobat provides essential electronic document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers 
accomplish a wide variety of tasks ranging from simple publications and forms to mission-critical engineering documentation and 
architectural plans. With our Acrobat product and its innovative cloud services, we have extended the capabilities of our solutions. 
Users can turn slow, manual signing processes into automated experiences and collect signatures with Adobe Scan, Adobe Sign 
and Adobe Send & Track.
Digital Media Strategy
 Our goal is to be the leading platform for creativity where we offer a range of products and services that allow individuals, 
teams and enterprises to design and deliver amazing digital content.
 We believe there is significant opportunity for growth across all customer segments and expect Creative Cloud will drive 
sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users in North America 
and international markets.  We will continue to  seek to deepen our relationship with existing users through meeting their needs 
holistically and delivering additional features and value.  As appropriate, we plan to optimize our pricing strategy and move our 
customers to higher priced and better value offerings and continue to employ targeted promotions that attract past customers and 
potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. To target new customers and better address the needs of our 
existing customers, we will continue to invest in driving innovation to maintain the leadership position that we have established. 
We have also built a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe 
Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more 
new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably .
 As part of our Creative Cloud strategy , we utilize our Experience Cloud solutions to drive customer awareness and licensing 
of our creative products and services through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming the 
destination site where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. 
We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force 
is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.
 We offer many of the products included in Creative Cloud on a standalone basis, including subscriptions to the Creative 
Cloud version of certain point products. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including our hobbyist products 
such as Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements, Typekit and mobile apps such as Photoshop Mix, Photoshop Sketch, Photoshop 
Fix, Adobe Capture CC, and Adobe Spark. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under “Principal 
Products and Services.”
 In our Document Cloud business, although Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption in document-intensive industries 
such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical publishing, we believe there are 
tens of millions of users who need the capabilities provided by Acrobat and the service capabilities found in Document Cloud. We 
plan to continue marketing the benefits of our Document Cloud solutions, combined with the low entry point of subscription-
based pricing, to individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around 
the world. We aim to increase our seat penetration in these markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing 
programs. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the business, including the recently announced Adobe 
Sign partnership with Microsoft. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical 
markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emer ging markets, 
while simultaneously enhancing and building out the delivery of cloud-based document services to our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat 
Reader users. We intend to continue promoting the capabilities of our cloud-based document solutions to millions of Acrobat users 
and hundreds of millions of Adobe Acrobat Reader users. Our Adobe Sign services provide a green alternative to costly paper -
based solutions, and are an easier way for customers to manage their contract workflows. The Adobe Scan app for mobile devices 
can be used to capture paper documents as images and transform them into full-featured PDFs via Adobe Document Cloud services 
that can be shared immediately , essentially putting scanning capabilities in the pocket of every person. We believe that by growing 
the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market and continuing to add new capabilities 
Table of Contents
6to our Adobe Scan and Sign offerings, we can help our customers migrate away from paper -based express mailing and adopt our 
solution, growing our revenue with this business in the process.
Digital Experience
Digital Experience Opportunity
 Consumers today increasingly demand personalized content and experiences in their digital interactions, across multiple 
channels and devices. As a result, businesses must figure out how to best attract, engage, acquire and retain customers in a digital 
world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impact success. Delivering the best experience to a consumer at a given 
moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content. Executives are increasingly demanding solutions that optimize 
their consumers’  experiences and deliver the greatest return on their marketing and IT spend so they can demonstrate the success 
of their programs using objective metrics.
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. The 
world’ s leading brands are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising, and development budgets toward digital experiences.  
As enterprises make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as customers look for vendors to help them navigate this 
transition. Enterprises need to ensure they deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers across digital channels and in areas 
such as sales, support, and product interactions where consumers expect experiences to be consistent and personalized.
 Our Experience Cloud business targets this large and growing opportunity by providing comprehensive solutions that include 
analytics, targeting, advertising optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience 
management, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize 
and optimize digital experiences across channels for optimal performance. 
 We believe the market for Experience Cloud is rapidly expanding, and industry analysts predict more advertising dollars 
will be spent in digital than in traditional media in the future. 
Digital Experience Strategy
 Our goal is to be the leading provider of solutions that enable our customers to provide exceptional digital experiences.  
Our integrated cloud-based solutions enable enterprises to build personalized campaigns, manage advertising, and gain deep 
intelligence about their customers.  Our content and data platform provides differentiation and competitive advantage. 
 In March 2017, we migrated our hierarchy of solutions under what was formerly known as Adobe Marketing Cloud to our 
next generation offering referred to as Adobe Experience Cloud.
 Adobe Experience Cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:
• Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and 
engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; 
includes Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and Adobe Primetime.
• Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating 
audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through 
the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating 
that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager . 
• Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and 
digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; 
combines capabilities from Adobe Media Optimizer (“AMO”) and Adobe’ s acquisition of TubeMogul during the 
first quarter of fiscal 2017.
 We believe the artificial intelligence and machine learning framework enabled by our strategy with Adobe Sensei enhances 
the delivery of digital experiences.  By building on existing features such as Enhanced Anomaly Detection, Auto-T arget, and other 
capabilities, we believe Adobe Sensei will increase the value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation 
in the market.
 To drive growth of Experience Cloud, we also intend to focus on customer engagement, partner leverage, and product 
differentiation. We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive 
ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, SIs and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our 
solutions to their customers. Strategic partnerships, such as the one we have formed with Microsoft, continue to increase our 
Table of Contents
7market reach. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and believe 
these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Experience segment in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
Publishing
 Our Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning 
solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. Graphics professionals and 
professional publishers continue to require quality , reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostScript and 
Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As 
high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are well positioned to be a 
supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry .
 We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output 
devices. In fiscal 2017, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and 
license in our Publishing business.
 In December 2017, in order to more closely align our Digital Experience business with the strategic growth opportunity ,  
we moved two legacy enterprise software offerings from our Digital Experience segment to Publishing: our Adobe Connect web 
conferencing platform and Adobe LiveCycle, an enterprise document and forms platform. Since fiscal 2012, the focus of marketing 
and licensing these products has been to financial services and government markets, driven by a subset of our enterprise sales 
force. We have also been focused on migrating some legacy LiveCycle customers to an updated offering with similar capabilities 
based on our Adobe Experience Manager solution.
COMPETITION
 The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving 
distribution models, disruptive technology developments, frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting 
with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. Our future success will depend 
on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-ef fective basis, 
meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber -attacks, 
extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods 
and other technological changes.
Digital Media
 No single company has offerings that match the capabilities of our Creative Cloud products and services, but we face 
collective competition from a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. Our competition includes offerings 
from companies such as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Facebook, Corel, Microsoft, Quark and others, as well as from many lower -end 
offerings. We believe our greatest advantage in this space is the performance and scope of our integrated solutions, which work 
together as part of Creative Cloud. With Creative Cloud, we compete favorably on the basis of features and functionality , ease of 
use, product reliability , value and performance characteristics.
 Professional digital imaging, drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand 
awareness and price sensitivity . Competition in this space is also emer ging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet 
and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly 
evolving and highly volatile. In this area, we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various 
proprietary and open source web-authoring tools.
 We face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings by bundling, 
for free, their own digital imaging software or those of our competitors. Similarly , we face potential competition from operating 
system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating 
systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their 
devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social networking platforms 
such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! 
are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software. Online 
storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers will be encouraged to use the image and video editing 
software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.
 In addition, the needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology 
and hardware advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other 
Table of Contents
8new devices. Our imaging and video offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and Premiere Pro, face competition 
from established and emer ging companies offering similar products.
 New image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional tools are 
also emer ging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to intense 
competition, including customer price sensitivity and competitor brand awareness. We face direct and indirect competition in the 
consumer digital imaging space from a number of companies whose market software competes with our offerings.
 The stock content marketplace has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily 
operates today with our Adobe Stock offering. Key competitors in this segment include Shutterstock, Getty Images and a number 
of smaller companies.  Adobe Stock’ s deep product integration with Creative Cloud and superior reach and relationships with 
creative professionals around the world differentiate our offerings.
 The nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge 
workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and 
Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, other 
PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web or via mobile applications. To address these competitive 
threats, we are working to ensure our Adobe Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emer ging 
opportunities such as PDF document generation, document collaboration and document security , and have developed mobile 
solutions such as Adobe Scan.
 As e-signatures are quickly becoming a core element of digital documents, competitors to Adobe Sign such as DocuSign 
have emer ged. Partnerships and integrations between these companies and third-parties create an increasingly competitive 
landscape in this space.  
Digital Experience
 The markets in which our Digital Experience business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense 
competition. Our Experience Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Marketo, Oracle, 
salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Verizon, Teradata and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. 
Additionally , new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to 
customers, generally through a web browser , while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. 
In addition, we compete at times with our customers’  or potential customers’  internally developed applications. Of the competitors 
listed above, no single company has products identical to our Experience Cloud offerings. Experience Cloud competes in a variety 
of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization; online and social marketing; audience 
management; advertising and real-time bidding technology; video delivery and monetization; web experience management and 
others.
 Large software, internet and database management companies have expanded their offerings in the digital experience area, 
either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic partners of ours. We believe competitive 
factors in our markets include the proven performance, security , scalability , flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic 
relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable 
cost-ef fective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands; enterprise-level 
customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time data and reporting; independence 
from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in educating customers in how to utilize 
services effectively . We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-cost alternatives based on many of these 
competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our focus on global, multi-brand companies, our 
superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, standards-based architecture, scalability and 
performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.
 Creative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital experience technology 
to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come to market 
with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital experience capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete 
technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked 
closely with marketing and creative customers for over 30 years. We also believe we have leadership in this space, with current 
customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in 
serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization, 
digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, video delivery and monetization 
and social capabilities in our Experience Cloud. Most importantly , we provide a vision for our digital experience customers as we 
Table of Contents
9engage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending from their use of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud 
to how they manage, deliver , measure and monetize their content with our Experience Cloud.
Publishing
 Our Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies, 
as well as lower -end desktop publishing products. Similarly , our web conferencing product faces competition from a number of 
established products from other companies, including Cisco, Citrix and Microsoft. Competition involves a number of factors, 
including: product features, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of customization and integration with other publishing 
system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete 
based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among users, the widespread adoption of our products among 
printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming interfaces.
 In printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language 
or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability , price, support and engineering development 
assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency , OEM customer relationships and our 
intellectual property portfolio.

15PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT
 
 A continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of new 
solutions due to the speed of technological change that characterizes the software industry . We develop our software internally , 
as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns 
the technology . In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed 
by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based 
on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.
During fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , our research and development expenses were $1.22 billion , $976.0 million  and $862.7 
million , respectively .
PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS
 We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign 
intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have United States and foreign patents and 
pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology . Although our patents have value, no single 
patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and 
international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. 
 Our enterprise customers license our hosted offerings as On-demand Services or Managed Services, and consumers primarily 
use our desktop software and mobile apps.  We license our desktop software to users under ‘click through’  or signed license 
agreements containing restrictions on duplication, disclosure, and transfer . Similarly , cloud products and services are provided to 
users under ‘click through’  or signed agreements containing restrictions on access and use.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may 
attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing 
unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use 
software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing may 
improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.
EMPLOYEES

relations are good.

18ITEM 1A.  RISK FACT ORS
As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss 
some of the factors that could cause these differences. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect 
our operations, performance and financial condition.
If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products 
and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
The process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, 
costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers’  rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emer ging technological 
trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain 
appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect 
customer demand for our products and services. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may 
not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. Additionally , any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or 
launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract 
new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. 
We offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. Consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet 
and mobile devices. If we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices, or if our competitors can adapt their 
products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more 
difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or 
operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.
Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively .
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving 
distribution models, limited barriers to entry , disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price 
sensitivity and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of 
charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal 
and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our continued 
ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-
effective manner , meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate 
emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Furthermore, some of 
our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and 
other resources, broader brand awareness, and access to larger customer bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current 
customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. In addition, consolidation 
has occurred among some of our competitors. Further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive 
pressures and may harm our results of operations.
For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive envir onment in which we 
operate, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Part I. Item 1 of this report.
Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.
The expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving.  Our future success depends on a variety of 
factors, including our continued ability to innovate, introduce new products and services efficiently , enhance and integrate our 
products and services in a timely and cost-ef fective manner , extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate 
emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Integration of our products 
and services with one another and other companies’  offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on 
third parties. If any disruptive technology , or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our 
solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed. 
The introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products 
rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. 
We use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, gauge the performance of their advertisements, and detect 
and prevent fraudulent activity . Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or “ad-blocking” software or 
applications. The most common Internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being 
accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. Increased use of methods, software or applications 
that block cookies could harm our business.

19Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.
Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and ETLAs in our Digital 
Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including:
• the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our 
products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;
• the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements 
prior to making information technology expenditures;
 
• the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and 
evaluation of our products and services;
• intensifying competition within the industry; 
• the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;
• the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due 
to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments within customers’  organizations; and
• customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately 
purchase our solutions.  As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could 
have a greater impact on our results of operations.  Additionally , our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where 
a higher percentage of a quarter ’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter , which is common in our industry .  Our 
extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.
Subscription of ferings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.  
We generally recognize revenue from subscription of ferings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, 
which range from 1 to 36 months. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of 
subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may 
not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter .  Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue 
in future quarters.  Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be 
fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it dif ficult for us to 
rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from 
new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. 
Additionally , in connection with our sales ef forts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors 
could af fect our revenue, including longer -than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to 
multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from 
our subscription-based of ferings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.
If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results 
could suf fer.
Our Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud of ferings typically involve subscription based 
offerings pursuant to product and service agreements. Revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably 
over the term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months.  Our customers have no obligation to renew their 
subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and customers may not renew their 
subscriptions at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. 
Moreover , under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration 
of the terms. Our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we of fer in the length of our subscription-based 
agreements complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be 
able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates.
Table of Contents
20Our customers’  renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of 
satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality , the reliability (including uptime) of 
our subscription of ferings, the prices of of ferings and those of fered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information 
security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers’  spending levels or 
declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not 
renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.
Security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalf, may compromise the confidentiality , 
integrity , or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely af fect our 
reputation and business.
We process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, most of which is hosted by third-party service 
providers. A security incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service providers may compromise the 
confidentiality , integrity or availability of this data. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of data stored by Adobe or our service 
providers may occur through break-ins, breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party , employee theft or misuse or other 
misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may be obtained through inadequate use 
of security controls by customers or employees. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber -attackers 
to gain access to customer data. Additionally , failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or the granting of 
accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner , may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. 
If there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information 
we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject 
to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations, or fines. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of 
the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our 
business.
We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, as well as access, collect, 
use, transmit, and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or 
transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.
Much of our business relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed, and controlled directly by Adobe or third-
party service providers, including our online store at adobe.com, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud solutions. 
We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our 
disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting 
or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with 
us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational 
harm, costly and time intensive notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future business. Occasionally , we 
migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments. If a transition among data centers or to third-party service 
providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity , or unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken 
during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services to customers and result in increased costs and liabilities, 
which may harm our operating results and our business.
It is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) 
could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies 
that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with regulatory notification 
requirements. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including 
access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic 
on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses, worms, or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and 
the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation, and costly and 
time intensive notification requirements. 
We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a 
number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. If we 
fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience 
a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages could occur and our 
customers could suffer impaired performance of our services.  Such a strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject us to 
regulatory notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments, financial liabilities, result in customer 
dissatisfaction, or harm our business.  If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, 
store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could 
be found liable for damages or incur other losses.

21Increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose us to increased 
liability .
U.S. privacy and data security laws apply to our various businesses. We also do business globally in countries that have 
more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States that may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to 
evolving and differing interpretations. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing 
how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. Globally , new laws, such as the General Data Protection 
Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe, and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may 
affect our ability (and our enterprise customers’  ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise 
and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction, and deletion of their personal 
information), and to implement our business models effectively . These new laws may also impact our innovation and business 
drivers in developing new and emer ging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). These requirements, 
among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. 
Any perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy rights may subject us to public criticism, 
class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of 
which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability . Additionally , we store information on behalf of our customers 
and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm 
to us.
Transferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. For example, European 
data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely 
upon for European data transfers (e.g. Privacy Shield and Model Clauses) are being contested in the European court system. We 
are closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data outside the EU. These requirements 
may result in an increase in the obligations required to provide our services in the EU or in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. 
Several other countries, including Australia and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers 
of personal information. These developments in Europe and elsewhere could harm our business, financial condition and results 
of operations.
Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.
 Maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. Security 
researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security 
measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach our data security systems and 
misused some of our systems and software in order to access our end users’  authentication and payment information. In addition, 
cyber -attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools, and other malicious software programs, 
some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. Sophisticated hardware and 
operating system applications that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including 
bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer ’s ability to operate 
or use our products. The costs to prevent, eliminate, notify affected parties of, or alleviate cyber - or other security problems, bugs, 
viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems 
may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or 
potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.
 Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products 
or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. Unauthorized parties may 
also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access 
to our products, services, or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. These actual and potential breaches 
of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information 
or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss 
or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our 
employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result in litigation 
and liability or fines, our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a 
loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our 
present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand 
and reputation. These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services, and store 
and process more data, including personal information.
 These problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber -attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular 
offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be identified in some of our 
applications. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected 
system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and services to 
customers. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing 
Table of Contents
22security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying 
updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be 
totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures 
quickly enough to prevent cyber -attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. Despite our preventative 
efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against 
us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, to reduce 
or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. If we do not make the appropriate level 
of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality 
of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed 
to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Further , if we or our 
customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, we could be subject to costly and time 
intensive notice requirements, and it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional 
expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or 
margins. Moreover , delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber -attacks or 
preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may 
disrupt our business and management.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of a company , division, product or technology , 
each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:
• inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
• difficulty in, and the cost of, ef fectively integrating the operations, technologies, products or services, and personnel 
of the acquired business;
• entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger 
market positions;
• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities 
and challenges;
• inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
• inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
• inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
• incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating 
results;
• elevated delinquency or bad debt write-of fs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;
• increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business 
models;
• additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to a multinational 
corporation;
• difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;
• impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our 
technologies, products or services;
• failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired 
company or technology;
• exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an 
acquisition, such as claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;
Table of Contents
23• incurring significant exit char ges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
• inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are ef fective;
• inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner , approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent 
such acquisitions; 
• the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
• delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service 
offerings; and
• incompatibility of business cultures.
Mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky . If we do not complete an announced acquisition 
transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner , we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition 
to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.
Changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and 
results of operations.
We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed 
to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the 
adoption of new accounting principles can have a significant effect on our reported results, and could even retroactively affect 
previously reported transactions, and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we 
change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. For additional 
information regarding these updated standards, see the section titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective” 
within Part II. Item 8, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and income, or 
cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results. 
Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
 We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. 
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless 
the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While, as of the balance sheet date, we 
do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated 
as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these 
earnings.
 Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily 
to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax 
rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the 
tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax 
rates, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in 
the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 In addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where 
we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, 
including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries and other governmental bodies 
have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to 
the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns 
filed in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related 
Table of Contents
24to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our 
operations and financial results. 
 Moreover , we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 
(“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer 
pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to 
determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. 
We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our 
operating results and financial position.
The success of some of our product and service of ferings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers 
of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.
 The success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to 
attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain 
existing customers and contributors. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, 
which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of 
our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers 
and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our 
collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our 
results of operations.
We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.
As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, 
we are subject to a number of risks, including:
• foreign currency fluctuations and controls;
• international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns 
abroad;
• tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);
• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
• changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
• changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
• failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
• inadequate local infrastructure and dif ficulties in managing and staf fing international operations;
• delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology , tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;
• the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand 
our business;
• costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;
• operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
• other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war , natural disasters and pandemics.
Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks and if our third-
party business partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks, our business may be harmed.  If sales to any of our customers 
outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.

25We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally , which may harm our business.
We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally . 
These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, 
data and transaction processing security , payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated 
content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency , corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, 
employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory 
requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and 
may at times conflict. For example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to 
engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, and business partners will not take actions in violation of 
our internal policies or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes 
in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability . Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, 
criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our 
reputation. 
In addition, approximately 52% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly , we are exposed to 
changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations 
regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy , unemployment tax rates, workers’  
compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our 
operating costs. 
Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of 
the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.
As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic 
and political conditions, both domestically and globally . Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political 
conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions 
about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology 
purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more 
extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Among our customers are government 
entities, including the U.S. federal government, and our revenue could decline if spending cuts impact the government’ s ability to 
purchase our products and services. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could 
also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and 
affect our derivative counterparties. Any of these events would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of 
operations.
Political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would 
also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including 
our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade 
secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. Preventing 
unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as 
we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy 
activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. We apply for patents in the U.S. and 
internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable to obtain patent protection for the technology described 
in our pending patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely , this could result in revenue loss, adverse effects on operations, and 
harm to our business.   We offer our products and services in foreign countries and we may seek intellectual property protection 
from those foreign legal systems.  Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property 
protection laws and schemes as those offered in the U.S.  In some foreign countries, the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property 
rights may be inadequate to protect our technology , which could harm our business.  
If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber -attack or otherwise, we could lose future 
trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete 
with our products by copying functionality , which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and 
operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure 
Table of Contents
26agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However , there is a risk that our confidential information and 
trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult 
or costly .
We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.
 We have been, are currently , and may in the future be, subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation 
relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. 
Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the 
attention of management and key personnel. We may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property 
disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into 
royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of 
our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the 
markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual 
provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring 
the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with 
our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.
Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business. 
We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-
offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly review our program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency 
fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary . Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial 
impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial 
condition or results of operations.
Failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers’  requests could 
harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.
Our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services. We 
outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. We depend 
heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to continue 
to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to 
influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. Our customers 
may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if these third-
party organizations are based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support 
providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers 
and associated revenue.
Failure to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
We contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which is individually responsible 
for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. Nonetheless, if any single agreement with one of our distributors 
were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and 
services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors 
and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel 
partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, 
export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior . 
We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively . If 
our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. Our distributors also sell our 
competitors’  products and services, and if they favor our competitors’  products or services for any reason, they may fail to market 
our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to 
suffer. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs decide not to bundle our 
applications on their devices, our results could suffer. In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing 
relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in 
Table of Contents
27economic conditions, which could result in insolvency , the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of 
our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us.
We also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel include 
more extended sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating 
our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives. Moreover , recent hires may not become 
as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity . Our 
business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and 
we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer 
relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.
Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process. 
We provide products and services, directly and indirectly , to a variety of government entities, both domestically and 
internationally . Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended 
sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and 
other government-specific contractual requirements. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government 
contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination 
of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation 
and financial results.
Revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to 
decline.
In the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. A 
number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as:
• shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), 
sales of our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings, or other key performance metrics;
• changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
• whether our results meet analysts’  expectations;
• compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies;
• the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or 
significant agreements by us or our competitors;
• the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new 
customers;
• recruitment or departure of key personnel;
• variations in our or our competitors’  results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and 
developments in our industry; 
• general socio-economic, political or market conditions; and
• unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and 
other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. 
In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general may experience uneven investor confidence, 
which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. Volatility 
in the market price of a company’ s securities for a period of time may increase the company’ s susceptibility to securities class 
action litigation. Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts management’ s attention and resources which may 
adversely affect our business. 
Table of Contents
28If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. 
These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could 
harm our business, especially if we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business is also dependent 
on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. Experienced 
personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas 
where our employees are located. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced 
personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract 
and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. 
We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower 
costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures.  Nonetheless, 
as globalization continues, competition for these employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to retain 
these employees and increase our expenses resulting from competitive compensation. We may continue to expand our international 
operations and international sales and marketing activities, which would require significant management attention and resources. 
We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may 
not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, causing our results to suffer.  
We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster 
innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow , including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired 
in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, 
which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to 
earnings.
GAAP  requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually . In addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable 
intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible 
assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our 
industry . Depending on the results of our review , we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial 
statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively 
impacting our results of operations.
We have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our 
financial condition and future financial results. 
We have $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding. We also have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit 
agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, 
among other things: 
• increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;
• requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby 
reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; 
and
• limiting our flexibility in planning for , or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry .
Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to 
maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our 
control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable 
cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our 
debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if 
our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility 
could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our ability to obtain 
additional financing in the future.

29Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology 
systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, some 
of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving 
our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability . A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or 
third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, 
telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics, cyber -attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic 
event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of 
intellectual property , delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss 
of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’  orders or could negatively impact a country 
or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’ s or region’ s demand for our products. Our 
corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain 
other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant 
operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results 
in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely 
affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize 
that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted.  Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where 
we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority .  Our major sites in California, Utah and India 
are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. In the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited 
access to these resources, we have the potential to experience losses to our business, and added costs to resume operations.
Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.
Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 1, 2017 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial 
paper , foreign government securities and U.S. Treasury securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits 
and asset-backed securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our 
exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer , as 
well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising 
from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and 
expense to vary from expectations. As of December 1, 2017, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-
term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we 
cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability , and can provide no assurance that our investment 
portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, 
including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted 
litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by 
diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or 
resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual 
property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable 
terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our 
sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy 
indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service 
agreements.
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and, based on known facts, assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss 
can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, we have determined that no provision for liability 
nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding 
amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss 
cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our piracy conversion efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business 
Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to 
counter -claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to 
such counter -claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be 
negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.

35ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF 
OPERA TIONS  
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
ACQUISITIONS 
During fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company , for 
$560.8 million . As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable 
segment. 
During fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, 
images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million . During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable 
segment. 
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not 
been presented for any of our fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was 
not material.
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. 
CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMA TES
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules and regulations of 
the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, 
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical 
experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially 
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and 
estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income 
taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results 
of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical 
accounting policies. Historically , our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not 
differed materially from actual results.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of 
software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most 
of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-
contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer . 
Throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes 
allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently 
expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry 
needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer ’s life cycle.
We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists; we have delivered the product or performed the service; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is probable. 
Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have 
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. 
We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, 
maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered 
products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor -specific objective evidence  (“VSOE”); 
and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the 
undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 
revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements 
of the arrangement have been delivered. However , if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 
Table of Contents
36arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the 
elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a 
particular period.
We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate 
for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling 
prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, 
consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, 
third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total 
price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software 
or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy . We determine 
the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE 
of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP . Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, 
we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition 
criteria are met for each element.
We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP . BESP  is generally 
used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP  
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market 
conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into 
consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate 
certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make 
reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly , our assumptions and judgments 
regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially 
impacting our financial position and results of operations.
Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future 
returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in 
accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by 
our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory 
in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated 
provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The 
amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product 
in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry 
environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of 
operations.
In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels 
are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, 
product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates 
are inherently subjective. Accordingly , if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which 
would impact the total net revenue we report.
We recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning 
on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through 
the end of the contractual service term. Over -usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which 
we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced 
in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such 
as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as 
contract milestones, when applicable.

37Accounting for  Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates 
to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax 
laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic 
tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could 
be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our 
intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from 
these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that 
may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however , the final determination of any of these 
examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the 
amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results 
and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates 
of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our 
actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. 
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless 
the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing 
our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated 
as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these 
earnings. 
Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to 
discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates 
could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax 
rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions 
in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by 
unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation 
of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
In addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where 
we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, 
including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries and other governmental bodies 
have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to 
the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns 
filed in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related 
to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us, which could adversely affect our 
operations and financial results. 
 Moreover , we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and 
foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as 
other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our 
provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance 
that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial 
position.

38RESUL TS OF  OPERA TIONS
Overview of 2017
For fiscal 2017, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our 
two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of 
products and solutions. 
In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and 
publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user 
files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users’  machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features 
with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained 
long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of Creative 
Cloud’ s low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest 
release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content 
in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, 
attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably .
We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our 
Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile 
applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately 
subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements 
(“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.
We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, 
the Adobe Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation 
and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe 
enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and 
Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review , approve, sign and track documents whether on a 
desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and 
perpetual licenses.
Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health 
and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and 
unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust 
our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2017 are 
based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2017 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:
Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services
+ 
Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value

Table of Contents
39Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2017 was $4.63 billion , up from $3.52 billion  at the end of fiscal 2016. Document Cloud ARR 
exiting fiscal 2017 was $600 million , up from $472 million  at the end of fiscal 2016. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $5.23 
billion  at the end of fiscal 2017, up from $3.99 billion  at the end of fiscal 2016. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2017 using 
currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2018, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2017 would be $5.39 billion or 
approximately $154 million higher than the ARR reported above.
Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2017 was 
$4.17 billion , up from $3.18 billion  in fiscal 2016 and representing 31% year-over -year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 
2017 was $836.7 million , up from $764.9 million  in fiscal 2016 and representing 9% year-over -year revenue growth as we continue 
to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $5.01 billion  in fiscal 
2017, up from $3.94 billion  in fiscal 2016 and representing 27% year-over -year growth. 
We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Digital Marketing 
business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital 
experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. 
These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital 
experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. In March 2017, we migrated our hierarchy of solutions under 
what was formerly known as Adobe Marketing Cloud to our next generation offering referred to as Adobe Experience Cloud.  
Adobe Experience Cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:
• Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage 
their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes 
Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Adobe Social and Adobe Primetime.
• Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating 
audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the 
capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data 
into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager . 
• Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital 
formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; combines 
capabilities from Adobe Media Optimizer (“AMO”) and Adobe’ s acquisition of TubeMogul during the first quarter of 
fiscal 2017.
In addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions include 
advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing 
executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. 
By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers 
to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end 
workflow and feedback loop.
We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem 
of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our 
solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, 
and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of 
$2.03 billion in fiscal 2017, which represents 24% year-over -year growth. 
Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2017

Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased  $1.07 billion  during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily driven by 
increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings. 
Revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock 
photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2017 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue 
associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in individual, team and enterprise subscriptions. Also contributing 
to the increase in revenue was revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering.
Adobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during 
fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to increases in Document Cloud subscriptions revenue, offset in part by 
expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetually licensed Acrobat offering.  Also contributing to the increase in 
Document Cloud revenue was an increase in Adobe Sign revenue.
Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased  $383.4 million  during fiscal 2017 , as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to 
subscription revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud.  The increase in subscription revenue was driven by 
strong performance with our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings, which include AEM and Adobe Campaign, and our Adobe Analytics 
Cloud offerings, which includes Audience Manager . Also contributing to the increase in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue were 
increases in revenue associated with our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings, including Tubemogul which we acquired in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2017 .

Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased $845.8 million during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by 
increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings. 
Revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock 
photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue 
associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team 
subscriptions, and continued adoption of our ETLAs. To a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our Creative Cloud 
Photography Plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated 
with our creative offerings. Increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue 
associated with our perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.
Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, decreased slightly during 
fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015 , primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual 
license offering. Decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud subscription offerings 
as we continue to migrate more customers to our Document Cloud, along with increases in Adobe Sign revenue.
Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016 , as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to 
continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud, which increased 20% year over year. Increases in Adobe 
Experience Cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our AEM offerings and, to a lesser extent, the increase 
in revenue associated with Adobe Campaign.  Also contributing to the increase in Digital Marketing revenue was the increase in 
Adobe Analytics Cloud revenue.

Backlog
Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue 
recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year , non-
cancelable commercial subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. 
Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing subscription, 
SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial 
statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry . As of 
December 1, 2017 , we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.94 billion  of which approximately 40% to 50%
is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2018. Comparatively , we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of 
approximately $3.42 billion  as of December 2, 2016 , of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be 
billed during fiscal 2017. 
We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, 
including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles 
of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes 
in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally , the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for 
multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior 
to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly , fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog 
may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, 
including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and 
related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of 
certain intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for hosting services and use of data 
center facilities. Our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar 
items. Cost of subscription revenue also includes media costs related to impressions purchased from third-party ad inventory 
sources for our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings.

offerings, which are part of the Adobe Advertising Cloud and were acquired through our acquisition of TubeMogul in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2017. Royalty costs increased due to increases in obligations to certain key vendors for technology use. 
Hosting services and data center costs increased in all periods presented primarily due to the continued increase in transaction 
volumes in our Adobe Experience Cloud and Creative Cloud offerings. 
The increase in cost of subscription revenue during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were partially offset by decreases

investments in the development of our subscription and service offerings, applications and tools.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and 
related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and

Amortization of Pur chased Intangibles
During the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of 
these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 
fourteen  years.
Amortization expense remained relatively consistent during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.  The decreases associated 
with certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions were offset by increases associated with intangible 
assets purchased through our acquisition of TubeMogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the write-of f of certain

foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.
Interest and other income (expense), net increased  in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to higher average invested 
balances and interest rates and a decline in foreign exchange hedging costs. 
Interest and other income (expense), net decreased  in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to a gain on the sale of 
certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and an increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset in part by an increase 
in interest income due to higher average invested balances and interest rates. 
Inter est Expense
Interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior 
notes is payable semi-annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are 
paid monthly . The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest 
payments.  See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate 
swaps.

As described in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , we early adopted the updated accounting standard 
for share-based payment accounting during fiscal 2017. As a result, we recorded deferred tax attributes that we were previously 
tracking pursuant to the rules that preceded this standard. The deferred tax asset recorded with the adoption was offset by the 
establishment of a valuation allowance.
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.  
The increase was partially related to a one-time tax cost associated with licensing acquired company assets to our trading 
subsidiaries, offset in part by the recognition of excess tax benefits due to our adoption of new accounting guidance related to 
stock-based compensation and the completion of certain income tax examinations. In addition to the above noted items, the effective 
tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations, and to 
a lesser extent, a one-time tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the fiscal 2015 U.S. Research and Development 
credit. 
Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. 
The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and 
the permanent extension of the U.S. Research and Development credit for 2015 and onward. The reinstatement of the credit was 
retroactive to January 1, 2015. A tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2016. The decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. In addition, the fiscal 2015 effective 
tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’ s trading companies, offset by 
tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development credit in December 2014.
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. 
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless 
the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing 
our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated 
as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these 
earnings. Currently , there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. 
See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our pr ovision for income 
taxes.  
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $172.9 million , $178.4 million and 
$258.7 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively , of which, $135.0 million, $144.5 million  and $220.2 million if 
recognized, would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively , which were net of the estimated $37.9 
million, $33.9 million  and $38.5 million federal benefits related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax 
returns for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively . 
Table of Contents
49The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately 
$23.6 million and $22.4 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively . These amounts were included in non-current income taxes 
payable in their respective years.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current 
assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $40 million .

in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below , business 
acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. 
Cash Flows fr om Operating Activities
For fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative 
Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the 
increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs 
associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases 
in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the TubeMogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes 
payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity , higher revenue levels, and increased media rebill receivables 
attributable to TubeMogul. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase.
For fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative 
Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the 
increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. The primary working 
capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes 
payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels.  Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 
Table of Contents
50primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of  fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due 
to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. 
For fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions 
for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase 
in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily 
due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The 
primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.

For fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities of $442.9 million  was primarily due to purchases of short-term 
investments and our acquisition of TubeMogul.  Other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment, including the 
Almaden Tower and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of 
short-term investments.
For fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million  was primarily due to purchases of short-term 
investments.  Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other 
assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. 
For fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion  was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments 
and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-
term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and 
proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets.
See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions 
and the Almaden Tower purchase, respectively .
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For  fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion  was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock 
repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock.
For  fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion  was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock 
repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock 
and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were 
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million .  In addition, we incurred issuance costs of 
$7.9 million .  Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using 
the effective interest method.  The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
We used $600 million  of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and 
unpaid interest of the $600 million  3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2015 (“2015 Notes”). The remaining proceeds were used 
for general corporate purposes.  See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. 
In addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 included 
payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds 
from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled “Stock Repur chase 
Program” discussed below .
We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities 
expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and 
administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to 
strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. 
Other  Liquidity and Capital Resour ces Considerations
Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2018 due to changes in our planned 
cash outlay , including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and 
Table of Contents
51investments totaled $5.82 billion  as of December 1, 2017 . Of this amount, approximately 89% was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
and subject to material repatriation tax effects. As of our balance sheet date, our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant 
portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign 
operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United 
States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection 
with repatriating these funds.
Subsequent to December 1, 2017 , the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Act”) was enacted and included broad tax reforms that 
are applicable to Adobe. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective January 
1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings amount of approximately $4 billion are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are 
available for repatriation, and our future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. These changes will require us to remeasure 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities and reclassify approximately $380 million of deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed 
foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years. In addition, based on preliminary estimates, we anticipate 
a tax provision charge of approximately $85 million in fiscal 2018 predominately due to the taxation of undistributed foreign 
earnings.
Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed 
in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However , based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our 
existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility 
will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. 
On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit 
Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit 
Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into 
an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the 
syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of December 1, 2017 , there were no outstanding borrowings under 
this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. 
As of December 1, 2017 , the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion , consisting of $900 million  of 
4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion  of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together 
with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). 
Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper , U.S. Treasury securities, 
foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. We use professional investment management firms 
to manage a large portion of our invested cash.
Stock Repur chase Program
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In 
January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 
billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. 
During fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion , $1.08 billion , and $625 million , respectively . 
We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted 
Average Price (“VW AP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the 
discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial 
institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there 
is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. During fiscal 2017 , we repurchased approximately 8.2 million  shares at an average price per share of $134.20  through 
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016 . During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased approximately 
10.4 million  shares at an average price per share of $97.16  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 
2016  and fiscal 2015 . During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 8.1 million  shares at an average price per share of $77.38
through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014. 
Table of Contents
52For fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2017 , December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015
were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 1, 2017 , $101.5 million  of prepayments remained 
under the agreement. 
Subsequent to December 1, 2017 , as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority , we entered into a structured stock repurchase 
agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million . This amount will 
be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $300 million  stock repurchase 
agreement, $1.6 billion  remains under our current authority .

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggr egate Contractual Obligations
 Our principal commitments as of December 1, 2017  consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and 
various service agreements. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding 
our contractual commitments.

Table of Contents
53Senior Notes
As of December 1, 2017 , our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying 
value of $1.88 billion .  Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually , in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At December 1, 
2017 , our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $350.6 million  for the remaining duration of our 
Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a 
floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 
1, 2020.
Covenants
Our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 1, 
2017 , we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal 
year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. 
Under the terms of our credit agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger 
an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
See Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income 
taxes.
Royalties
We have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is 
generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of  our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for 
certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director ’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 
ITEM 7A.  QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT  MARKET  RISK
All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.
Foreign Curr ency Risk
Foreign Curr ency Exposur es and Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us 
to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge 
our foreign currency revenue. Additionally , we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign 
exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected 
by changes in exchange rates. 
Table of Contents
54Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015  were as follows (in millions, except 
Japanese Yen):
Fiscal
2017Fiscal
2016Fiscal
2015
Euro € 1,044.7 € 825.6 € 589.6
Japanese Yen (in billions) ¥ 51.0 ¥ 38.7 ¥ 29.7
British Pounds £ 338.4 £ 263.5 £ 192
As of December 1, 2017 , the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and 
forwards, was $1.24 billion , which included the notional equivalent of $618.4 million  in Euros, $225.3 million  in British Pounds, 
$244.5 million  in Japanese Yen and $148.9 million  in other foreign currencies. As of December 1, 2017 , all contracts were set to 
expire at various dates through June 2018. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that 
would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net 
fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting 
arrangements that have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement 
transactions.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 1, 2017 . This sensitivity 
analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. 
Dollar . For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and 
a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our 
financial hedging instruments by $79.7 million . Conversely , a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a 
decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $23.6 million .
As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in 
countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the 
local currency denominated operating expenses. 
We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar 
functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016 , this long-term investment exposure 
totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $190.5 million  and $70.2 million , respectively . At this time, we do not hedge these long-
term investment exposures.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure 
in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and 
assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.
Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Curr ency Revenue 
We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in 
Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen.  We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows 
will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities 
between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course 
of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow 
hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it will not occur , 
we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and 
other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 1, 2017 , there were 
no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur .
Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward 
contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, 
net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because 
Table of Contents
55gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 1, 
2017 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.
See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.
Inter est Rate Risk
Short-T erm Investments and Fixed Income Securities
At December 1, 2017 , we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.51 billion . Changes in interest rates 
could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated 
maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):
Due within one year $ 1,023.7
Due between one and two years 1,289.3
Due between two and three years 812.8
Due after three years 387.9
Total $ 3,513.7
A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 1, 2017 . The analysis is based on an 
estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield 
curve of various magnitudes.
The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming 
immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.  The analysis is shown as of 
December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016  (dollars in millions):
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
12/1/17 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 3,595.2 $ 3,568.1 $ 3,540.9 $ 3,513.7 $ 3,486.5 $ 3,459.3 $ 3,432.1
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
12/2/16 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 3,828.5 $ 3,805.9 $ 3,778.4 $ 3,750.0 $ 3,721.6 $ 3,693.2 $ 3,664.8
Senior Notes
As of December 1, 2017 , the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion . In June 2014, we entered into 
interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR 
plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly , our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million . An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest 
rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.
As of December 1, 2017 , the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.88 billion  and the related fair value based on  
observable market prices in less active markets was $1.98 billion .
Other  Market Risk
Privately Held Long-T erm Investments
The privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are 
inherently risky . The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may 
never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of 
privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure 
regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy 
of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies 
as these investments were insignificant as of December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016 .

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF  PRESENT ATION AND SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Operations
Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. 
We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, 
enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and 
experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise 
customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www .adobe.com. We offer many 
of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted 
or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per -use models. We also distribute certain products and services 
through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors 
(“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology 
to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run 
on personal and server -based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have 
operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“AP AC”). 
Basis of Pr esentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all 
intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations 
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Use of Estimates
In preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules 
and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-
based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase 
commitments, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes and investments. Actual 
results may differ materially from these estimates.
Fiscal Y ear
Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal 
2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016
was a 53-week fiscal year compared with fiscal 2017  and 2015  which were 52-week fiscal years.
Reclassifications
Certain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, term-based and perpetual licensing of 
software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training, and technical support. Most 
of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-
contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer . 
We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. 
Table of Contents
ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
63Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have 
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. 
Multiple Element Arrangements
We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, 
maintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.
For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered 
products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor -specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); 
and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the 
undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 
revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements 
of the arrangement have been delivered. However , if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the 
elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a 
particular period.
We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate 
for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling 
prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, 
consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses. 
For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, 
third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total 
price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software 
or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy . We determine 
the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE 
of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP . Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, 
we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition 
criteria are met for each element.
We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP . BESP  is generally 
used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP  
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market 
conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into 
consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate 
certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make 
reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly , our assumptions and judgments 
regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially 
impacting our financial position and results of operations.
Subscription and Services and Support Revenue
We recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions, ratably beginning 
on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through 
the end of the contractual service term. Over -usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which 
we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced 
in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORA TED
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
64Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training, and maintenance and support, primarily related to 
the licensing of our enterprise, mobile and device products and solutions. Our support revenue also includes technical support and 
developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products.
Our consulting revenue is recognized using a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, 
such as hours incurred to date, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones when applicable. 
Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements on a when 
and if available basis or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the performance period of the 
arrangement.
Our software subscription offerings, which may include product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available 
basis, hosted services, and online storage, are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize 
revenue associated with these arrangements ratably over the subscription period.
Product Revenue
We recognize our product revenue upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our 
desktop application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price 
protection. Our direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly , we reduce revenue recognized 
for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are 
adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.
We recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided 
collection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing 
of securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting 
by our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately 
received from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.
Our product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license 
agreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item 
as the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade 
to an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the 
right to the specified free upgrade expires.
Rights of Return, Rebates and Price Pr otection
As discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies 
and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as 
an offset to revenue and accounts receivable. Below is a summary of each of the general provisions in our contracts:
• Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter . In addition, distributors 
are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and products that are being 
replaced by new versions.
• We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end user customers. The amount of revenue that is reduced for 
distributor and reseller rebates is based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting 
period (volume, timely reporting, etc.). If mail-in or other promotional rebates are offered, the amount of revenue reduced 
is based on the dollar amount of the rebate, taking into consideration an estimated redemption rate calculated using 
historical trends.
• From time to time, we may offer price protection to our distributors that allow for the right to a credit if we permanently 
reduce the price of a software product. The amount of revenue that is reduced for price protection is calculated as the 
difference between the old and new price of a software product on inventory held by the distributor immediately prior 
to the effective date of the decrease.

65Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel 
their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a 
customer cancels its contract, they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.
On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on our historical trends 
and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to 
determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future 
returns. When necessary , we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated 
requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product 
plans and other factors.

Deferr ed Revenue
 Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions 
described above. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade 
receivables. The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowances 
by considering such factors as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic 
conditions that may affect a customer ’s ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible.

Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are 
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years for computers and equipment 
as well as server hardware under capital leases, 1 to 6 years for furniture and fixtures, 5 to 20 years for building improvements 
and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the 
remaining respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.

66Goodwill, Pur chased Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment 
annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year. In performing our goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate goodwill to 
determine if it is more likely than not that the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances has reduced the fair value of a 
reporting segment below its carrying value. The qualitative assessment requires that we consider events or circumstances that may 
include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in 
management or key personnel, changes in strategy , changes in customers, changes in the composition or carrying amount of a 
reporting segments’  net assets, and changes in our stock price. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we 
determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting segments are greater than the carrying amounts, then 
the two-step goodwill impairment test is not performed.
If the qualitative assessment indicates that the two-step quantitative analysis should be performed, we evaluate goodwill 
for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value, including the associated 
goodwill. To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded 
companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow 
assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We determined, after performing 
a qualitative review of each reporting segment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting segments 
substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts. Accordingly , there was no indication of impairment, and the two-step 
quantitative goodwill impairment test was not performed. 
We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever 
an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts 
of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances 
occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted 
expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize 
an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible 
asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017 , 2016  or 2015 .
During fiscal 2017 , our intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 14 years. 
Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line 
basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:
 Weighted 
Average
Useful Life 
(years )
Purchased technology 5
Customer contracts and relationships 9
Trademarks 8
Acquired rights to use technology 9
Localization 1
Other intangibles 5 
Internal Use Softwar e
We capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development 
stage. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and 
payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with the development of the applications. Capitalization of 
such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially 
complete and is ready for its intended purpose.

67Income T axes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, 
and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount 
for which realization is more likely than not.
Taxes Collected from Customers
We net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements. 
Accordingly , taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the 
difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is 
re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that 
there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses 
upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015  were $141.7 million , 
$135.8 million  and $113.6 million , respectively .
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
We translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency , at exchange 
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include 
accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders’  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss).
Foreign Curr ency and Other Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We use foreign 
exchange option and forward contracts for revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge our net 
recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and 
cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them 
at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and 
whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings. See Note 5 for information regarding our hedging activities.
Gains and losses from foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each 
period as a component of interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option 
contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of 
tax, as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’  equity and reclassified into revenue at the time the forecasted 
transactions occur .
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, 
structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
68Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. 
Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy . 
Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of 
credit risk exists with respect to these investments.
We enter into foreign currency hedge contracts with bank counterparties that could expose us to credit related losses in the 
event of their nonperformance. This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received 
or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, 
we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty 
by permitting net settlement transactions. 
The aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016
was $14.2 million  and $38.1 million  respectively . These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date 
as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial 
liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties. 
Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, 
customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, 
dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’  financial condition and require letters of credit 
or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary . The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their 
ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments 
from their customers. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the 
customer ’s ability to pay is not probable, due to country risk or credit risk, we will not recognize the revenue. We will revert to 
recognizing the revenue on a cash basis, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition has been met.
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance 
On March 30, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 
No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies various aspects related to the 
accounting and presentation of share-based payments. The amendments require entities to record all tax effects related to share-
based payments at settlement or expiration through the income statement and the windfall tax benefit to be recorded when it arises, 
subject to normal valuation allowance considerations. Tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments are required 
to be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The updates relating to the income tax effects of the share-
based payments including the cash flow presentation must be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively . Further , the 
amendments allow the entities to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures or recognize forfeitures as they 
occur . If an election is made, the change to recognize forfeitures as they occur must be adopted using a modified retrospective 
approach with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings. The effective date of the new standard for 
public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption 
is permitted.
We early adopted this standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As required by the standard, excess tax benefits 
recognized on stock-based compensation expense were reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of the 
provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital on a prospective basis. Accordingly , we recorded excess tax benefits within 
our provision for income taxes, rather than additional paid-in capital upon adoption. The cumulative effect to retained earnings 
from previously unrecognized excess tax benefits, after offset by the related valuation allowance, was not significant to our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
We also elected to prospectively apply the change in presentation of excess tax benefits wherein excess tax benefits 
recognized on stock-based compensation expense were classified as operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash 
Flows for fiscal 2017. Prior period classification of cash flows related to excess tax benefits were not adjusted in our Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows. Presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no 
impact to all periods presented as such cash flows have historically been presented as financing activities. Further , we did not elect 
an accounting policy change to record forfeitures as they occur and thus we continue to estimate forfeitures at each period.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
69There have been no other new accounting pronouncements made effective during fiscal 2017 that have significance, or 
potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to 
recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. 
The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP  when it becomes effective and 
permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 
No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the 
new revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but 
not earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly , the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
We expect to adopt this updated standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently 
evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we currently believe that the most significant 
impact relates to our accounting for arrangements that include on-premise term-based software licenses bundled with maintenance 
and support. Under current GAAP , the revenue attributable to these software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the 
arrangement because VSOE does not exist for the undelivered maintenance and support element as it is not sold separately . The 
requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is 
eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly , under the new standard we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of 
the arrangement fee upon delivery of the software licenses. We expect revenue related to our professional services and cloud 
offerings, including Creative Cloud and Document Cloud for business enterprises, individuals and teams, to remain substantially 
unchanged. When sold with cloud-enabled services, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud require a significant level of integration 
and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct. Revenue for these offerings will 
continue to be recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  Under current GAAP , we expense costs related 
to the acquisition of revenue-generating contracts as incurred. Under the new standard, we will be required to capitalize certain 
costs incremental to contract acquisition and amortize them over the expected period of benefit. Due to the complexity of certain 
of our contracts, the actual accounting treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on 
contract-specific terms and therefore may vary in some instances.
On February 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and 
a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases with a lease term of twelve months or 
less. For lessees, leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. Lessor accounting 
is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model. Lessors will continue to classify 
leases as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new 
standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and requires application of the new guidance at the beginning 
of the earliest comparative period presented. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 
and we do not plan to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated 
Financial Statements and related disclosures.
On August 28, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging, requiring expanded hedge accounting 
for both non-financial and financial risk components and refining the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entity's 
hedging strategies. The updated standard also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how entities assess 
hedge effectiveness. The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 
2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified 
retrospective transition with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings as of the initial adoption date. 
The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we do not plan to early adopt. We are 
currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
With the exception of the new standards discussed above, there have been no other new accounting pronouncements  that 
have  significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

70NOTE 2.   ACQUISITIONS
TubeMogul
On December 19, 2016 , we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company . 
As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul’ s net tangible and 
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016 .  During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial 
purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management’ s estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, 
liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million  of which 
$348.4 million  was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million  to identifiable intangible assets 
and $99.3 million  to net assets acquired.
Fotolia
On January 27, 2015 , we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, 
images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and 
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015 . During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase 
accounting adjustments based on changes to management’ s estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, 
calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million  of 
which $745.1 million  was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million  to identifiable intangible 
assets and $142.0 million  to net liabilities assumed. 
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not 
been presented for any of our fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was 
not material.
NOTE 3.  CASH, CASH EQUIV ALENTS AND SHOR T-TERM INVESTMENTS
Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify 
all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as “available-for -sale.” In general, these investments are free of trading 
restrictions. We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. 
Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as 
a separate component of stockholders’  equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized when realized 
in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other -than-temporary decline in fair value has 
occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income. Gains and losses are determined using 
the specific identification method.

issuer and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the

down these investments to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded

See Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
Our fixed income available-for -sale debt securities consist of high quality , investment grade securities from diverse issuers 
with a weighted average credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing from independent pricing vendors who 
use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that model information generated by market 
transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly in determining 
fair value,  including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We 
therefore classify all of our fixed income available-for -sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing 
prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded.

75The fair values of our money market mutual funds and time deposits are based on the closing price of these assets as of the 
reporting date. We classify our money market mutual funds and time deposits as Level 1. 
Our Level 2 over-the-counter foreign currency and interest rate swap derivatives are valued using pricing models and 
discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.
Our deferred compensation plan assets consist of money market mutual funds and other mutual funds.
Assets and Liabilities Measur ed at Fair Value on a Nonr ecurring Basis
We also have direct investments in privately held companies accounted for under the cost and equity method, which are 
periodically assessed for other -than-temporary impairment. If we determine that an other -than-temporary impairment has occurred, 
we write down the investment to its fair value. We estimate fair value of our cost and equity method investments considering 
available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent 
operational performance and any other readily available market data. During fiscal 2017  and 2015, we determined there were no 
other -than-temporary impairments on our cost and equity method investments. During fiscal 2016 , we determined there were 
immaterial other -than-temporary impairments on certain of our cost method investments and wrote down the investments to fair 
value. 
The fair value of our senior notes was $1.98 billion  as of December 1, 2017 , based on observable market prices in less 
active markets and categorized as Level 2. See Note 15 for further details regarding our debt.
NOTE 5.  DERIV ATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Hedge Accounting and Hedging Pr ograms
We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of 
the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively , and record any 
ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of 
Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness 
was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income 
(expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which 
are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value 
of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting 
arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement 
of transactions. 
Balance Sheet Hedging —Hedges of For eign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward 
contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 
These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes 
in the fair value recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts 
do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are 
intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. 
As of December 1, 2017 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $333.9 million  which included the notional 
equivalent of $105.0 million  in Euros, $34.6 million  in British Pounds, $45.4 million  in Japanese Yen, $78.0 million  in Indian 
Rupees, and $70.9 million  in other foreign currencies. As of December 2, 2016 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts 
were $313.8 million  which included the notional equivalent of $152.8 million  in Euros, $33.6 million  in British Pounds, $46.5

76million  in Japanese Yen, $26.4 million  in Indian Rupees, and $54.5 million  in other foreign currencies. At December 1, 2017  and 
December 2, 2016 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.
Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of For ecasted For eign Curr ency Revenue
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use 
foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these 
foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months . 
We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the 
normal course of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, 
and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in 
the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on 
the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it 
will not occur , we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge 
accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are 
recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
For fiscal 2017  and 2016 , there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted 
transactions that did not occur . In fiscal 2015 , these net gains or losses were immaterial.
Fair V alue Hedging—Hedges of Inter est Rate Risks
During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our 
$900 million  of 4.75%  fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps 
convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we 
will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount 
through February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 15 for 
further details regarding our debt.
The interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged 
portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes 
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements 
of Income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reflected in other liabilities or other assets in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.

82We provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered 
permanently reinvested outside the United States. To the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently 
reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of 
December 1, 2017, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately  
$5.0 billion . The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately  $1.4 billion .
As of December 1, 2017 , we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $118.4 million  for federal and $52.6 
million  for state. We also have state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $166.2 million  and $16.2 million , 
respectively . The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2018  through 2036 . 
The state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely . The net operating loss carryforward assets and certain credits 
are reduced by the valuation allowance and are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the 
carrying amount of which are expected to be fully realized.
As of December 1, 2017 , a valuation allowance of $93.6 million  has been established for certain deferred tax assets related 
to the impairment of investments and certain state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2017 , the total change in the valuation allowance 
was $69.3 million , of which $55.3 million  was related to the deferred tax attributes recorded due to our early adoption of the new 
accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
During fiscal 2017  and 2016 , our aggregate changes in our total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized 
as follows (in thousands):
  2017 2016
Beginning balance $178,413 $258,718
Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions 3,680 6,047
Gross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions (30,166 ) (67,870 )
Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions 24,927 23,068
Settlements with taxing authorities (3,876 ) (33,265 )
Lapse of statute of limitations (8,819 ) (8,456 )
Foreign exchange gains and losses 8,786 171
Ending balance $172,945 $178,413
The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately 
$23.6 million  and $22.4 million  for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively . These amounts were included in non-current income taxes 
payable in their respective years.
We file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are 
subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our 
major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest 
fiscal years open for examination are 2008 , 2010  and 2013 , respectively . We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting 
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments 
that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however , there can be no assurance that the 
final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process.  These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current 
assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain 
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties 
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging 
from $0 to approximately $40 million .

83Subsequent to December 1, 2017 , the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Act”) was enacted and included broad tax reforms that 
are applicable to Adobe. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective January 
1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are available for repatriation, and our future 
foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. These changes will require us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities and 
reclassify deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years.
NOTE 10.  BENEFIT  PLANS
Retir ement Savings Plan
In 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is 
a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings 
Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary , subject to the Internal Revenue 
Service annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2017 , we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’ s eligible compensation. We 
contributed $34.3 million , $33.4 million  and $25.7 million  in fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , respectively . We are under no obligation 
to continue matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.
Deferr ed Compensation Plan
On September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, 
effective December 2, 2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, 
deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a 
portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100%  of other specified 
compensation, including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors’  
fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan 
year in which election is made. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in cash and in the form of a lump sum or annual 
installments over five years. For stock benefit elections, distributions are settled in stock and in the form of a lump sum payment 
only.
As of December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016 , the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan total $56.7 
million  and $42.2 million , respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 1, 
2017  and December 2, 2016 , $67.2 million  and $49.0 million , respectively , was recorded as long-term liabilities to recognize 
undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.
NOTE 1 1.  ST OCK-BASED COMPENSA TION
Our stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide 
incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-
based compensation plans and programs:
Restricted Stock Unit Plan
We grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (“2003 Plan”). 
Restricted stock units granted as part of our annual review process or for promotions vest annually over three years. Restricted 
stock units granted to new hires generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by our Board 
of Directors or an authorized committee.
We grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan which cliff-vest after three years. 
As of December 1, 2017 , we had reserved 183.2 million  shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and had 
93.6 million  shares available for grant.

84Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common 
stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP  consists of a twenty-four month offering period with four six-month 
purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our 
common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower . The ESPP  
will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under 
the plan have been issued.
As of December 1, 2017 , we had reserved 93.0 million  shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP  and 
approximately 7.0 million  shares remain available for future issuance.
Stock Option Plan
The 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-
employee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the 
shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed. Option vesting periods 
used in the past were generally four years and expire seven years from the effective date of grant. 
We eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees effective fiscal 2012, and for all of the non-employee directors 
effective fiscal 2014, but may choose to issue stock options in the future.  
Performance Shar e Programs
Our 2017, 2016 and 2015 Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, 
provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the ability of the Company to 
attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors 
approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology , under the terms of 
our 2003 Plan. Shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a 
three-year performance period. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest upon the later of the Executive 
Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement or the three-year anniversary of each grant. Program 
participants generally have the ability to receive up to 200%  of the target number of shares originally granted.
On January 24, 2017, the Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2017 Performance Share Program, the terms 
of which are similar to prior year performance share programs as discussed above. As of December 1, 2017 , the shares awarded 
under our 2017 , 2016  and 2015  Performance Share Programs are yet to be achieved.
Issuance of Shares
Upon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, and purchases of shares under the 
ESPP , we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact 
of on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, we instituted a 
stock repurchase program. See Note 12 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.
Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. 
Our performance share awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards are fixed at 
grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. 
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP  shares. The determination of the fair 
value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as 
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility 
over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and 
any expected dividends.

87Summary of Stock Options  
As of December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016 , we had 0.3 million  and 0.6 million  stock options outstanding, respectively . 
Grants to Executive Officers
All equity awards granted to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Grants to Non-Employee Directors  
Although the 2003 Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-employee 
directors, restricted stock units are the primary form of our grants to non-employee directors since fiscal 2014. The initial equity 
grant to a new non-employee director is a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate value of $0.3 million  based on the 
average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100%  on the day preceding the 
next annual meeting. The actual target grant value will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before the next annual 
meeting or the date of the first anniversary of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled. 
Annual equity grants to non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock units shall have an aggregate value of $0.3 
million  as based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100%
on the day preceding the next annual meeting. 
Restricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015  were as follows (in thousands):
  2017 2016 2015
Restricted stock units granted to existing directors 18 25 41
Compensation Costs
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis 
over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is 
based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis 
over the requisite service period of the entire award. The fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015  awards are earned upon achievement of an 
objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year performance period, as described above.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from 
those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards 
that are expected to vest.
As of December 1, 2017 , there was $708.3 million  of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, 
related to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Total unrecognized 
compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Stock Repur chase Program  
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In 
January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 
billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors 
is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.
During fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion , $1.08 billion , and $625 million , respectively . 
We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted 
Average Price (“VW AP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the 
discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial 
institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there 
is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. During fiscal 2017 , we repurchased approximately 8.2 million  shares at an average price per share of $134.20  through 
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016 . During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased approximately 
10.4 million  shares at an average price per share of $97.16  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 
2016  and fiscal 2015 . During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 8.1 million  shares at an average price per share of $77.38
through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014. 
For fiscal 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2017 , December 2, 2016  and November 27, 2015
were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 1, 2017 , $101.5 million  of prepayments remained 
under the agreement. 
Subsequent to December 1, 2017 , as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority , we entered into a structured stock repurchase 
agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million . This amount will 
be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $300 million  stock repurchase 
agreement, $1.6 billion  remains under our current authority .

90NOTE 13.  NET  INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, 
excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average 
common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, 
performance share awards, and stock options using the treasury stock method.

Diluted net income per share $ 3.38 $ 2.32 $ 1.24
For fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015  there were no options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater 
than the average fair market value of our stock of $138.71 , $96.39 , and $79.22 , respectively , that would have been anti-dilutive.
NOTE 14.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 Lease Commitments
We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire 
at various dates through 2031 . We also have one land lease that expires in 2091 . Rent expense includes base contractual rent and 
variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was 
approximately $115.4 million  in fiscal 2017  and $92.9 million  in both fiscal 2016  and 2015 . Our sublease income was immaterial 
for all periods presented.
We occupy three  office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these 
office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. 
In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million . Upon 
purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million  was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the 
Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million , the lesser of cost or fair value, 
which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. 
As of December 1, 2017 , we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San 
Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower . 
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

Subsequent to  December 1, 2017 , we purchased land near our headquarters in San Jose, California for a total purchase 
price of $68.0 million .
Royalties
We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally 
based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost 
of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $100.9 million , $79.8 million  and $62.3 million  in fiscal 
2017 , 2016  and 2015 , respectively .
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for 
certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director ’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We 
believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.
Legal Proceedings
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including 
patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. 
Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the 
attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past 
litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes 
could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent 
us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products

92or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification 
commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.
 In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our 
independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can 
be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim 
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be 
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is 
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software 
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter -claims 
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter -
claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively 
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.
NOTE 15.  DEBT
Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016  consisted of the following (in thousands):
  2017 2016
Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083
Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117
Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200
Senior Notes
 In February 2010, we issued $900 million  of 4.75%  senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). Our proceeds 
were $900 million  and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million . 
Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective 
interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest 
rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92%  . Interest is payable semi-annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 
1, and commenced on August 1, 2010 . 
In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million  designated as a fair value 
hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating 
interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate 
plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest 
from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives.

93In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were 
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of 
$7.9 million . Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using 
the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective 
interest rate including the discount, issuance costs and interest rate agreement is 3.67% . Interest is payable semi-annually , in arrears 
on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2015 . A portion of the proceeds from this offering was used to repay 
$600 million  in aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest due February 1, 
2015 . The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
As of December 1, 2017 , our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes (the “Notes”) with a 
total carrying value of $1.88 billion , which includes the fair value of the interest rate swaps and is net of debt issuance costs. Based 
on quoted prices in inactive markets, the fair value of the Notes was $1.98 billion  as of December 1, 2017 , which excludes the 
effect of the fair value of the interest rate swaps described above. 
We may redeem the Notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change 
of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Notes, at a price equal to 101%  of their principal amount, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on 
assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. As of December 1, 2017 , we were in 
compliance with all of the covenants.
In February and August 2017, we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2020 and 2025 Notes each totaling $37.6 
million .
 
Credit Agreement
On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit 
Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, 
subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, request up to an additional $500 million  in commitments, for a maximum 
aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion . Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, 
based on our public debt ratings, ranging from 0.795%  and 1.3%  or (ii) the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the 
agent’ s prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%  or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%  plus a margin, based on our debt 
ratings, ranging from 0.00%  to 0.30% . Commitment fees are payable quarterly at rates between 0.08%  and 0.20%  per year, also 
based on our debt ratings. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated 
as additional borrowers may borrow , prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term 
of the Credit Agreement. 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a 
financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include 
restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions and other 
matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to exceed a 
maximum leverage ratio. 
 On March 1, 2013, we exercised an option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement 
to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date to July 27, 2020 and 
reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. 
The facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the 
commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date 
is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.
As of December 1, 2017 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and we were in compliance 
with all covenants.

NOTE 17.  INDUSTR Y SEGMENT , GEOGRAPHIC INFORMA TION AND SIGNIFICANT  CUST OMERS
We report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal 
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.
Our CEO, the chief operating decision maker , reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable 
segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and 
intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. 
For fiscal 2017, we have the following reportable segments:
• Digital Media— Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium 
businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers 
include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their 
management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include 
knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. 
• Digital Marketing— Our Digital Marketing segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising 
and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, 
advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers, chief information officers and chief 
revenue officers.
• Print and Publishing— Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse 
authoring and publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM 
printing businesses.

97REPOR T OF INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Adobe Systems Incorporated:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of 
December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’  
equity , and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 1, 2017. We also have audited Adobe Systems 
Incorporated’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Contr ol 
- Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
Adobe Systems Incorporated’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in the accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 
9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audits.
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting 
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also 
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial 
position of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 1, 2017, in conformity with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Adobe Systems Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Contr ol - 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
 Adobe Systems Incorporated acquired TubeMogul, Inc. (TubeMogul) on December 19, 2016, as discussed in Note 2 to 
the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
appearing under Item 9A, management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Adobe System Incorporated’ s internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017, TubeMogul’ s internal control over financial reporting associated with 
consolidated total assets of approximately 1.8% and consolidated total revenues of approximately 2.5%, included in the consolidated 
financial statements of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 1, 2017. Our audit 
of internal control over financial reporting of Adobe Systems Incorporated as of December 1, 2017, also excluded an evaluation 
of the internal control over financial reporting of TubeMogul.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosur e Contr ols and Procedur es
Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 1, 2017 . Based on their evaluation 
as of December 1, 2017 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective 
at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-
K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’ s rules and regulations and 
(ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to 
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure 
controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no 
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control 
system are met. Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of 
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of 
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.
Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as 
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness 
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017 . In making this assessment, our management used the 
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Our management has concluded that, 
as of December 1, 2017 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
We acquired TubeMogul, Inc. (“TubeMogul”) on December 19, 2016, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. As permitted by the SEC staff’s Frequently Asked Question 3 on Management’ s Report on Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting and Certification of Disclosure in Exchange Act Periodic Reports (revised September 24, 2007), our 
management excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting effectiveness as of December 1, 2017 , 
TubeMogul’ s internal control over financial reporting associated with consolidated total assets of approximately 1.8%  and 
consolidated total revenues of approximately 2.5% , included in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended 
December 1, 2017 . We will include TubeMogul in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
starting fiscal 2018.
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 1, 2017  that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
