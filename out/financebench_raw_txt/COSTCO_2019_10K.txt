PART I
Item 1—Business
Costco
 Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principallyengaged
 in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan,Korea,
 Australia,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  China,  and  through  a  majority-owned  subsidiary  in  Taiwan.  Costco  operated 782 , 762,  and 741 warehouses worldwide at 
September 1, 2019 , September 2, 2018, and September 3, 2017 , respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”
We
 report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first threequarters
 consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). Thematerial
 seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2019  and 2018 relate
 to the 52-week fiscal years ended September  1, 2019,  and September  2, 2018,  respectively. References to 2017  relate  to the 53-week fiscalyear ended 
September 3, 2017 . General
We
 operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded andprivate-label products in a wide range of categ
ories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operatingefficiencies
 achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities,these
 volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most otherretailers. We generally sell inventory before we are require
d to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.We
 buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points  (depots)  or  directly  to  ourwarehouses.
 Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freightvolume and handling efficie
ncies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.Our
 average warehouse space is approximately 146,000  square  feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economyand efficiency in the use of selling space, the ha
ndling of merchandise,3

Table of Contentsand
 the  control  of  inventory.  Because  shoppers  are  attracted  principally  by  the  quality  of  merchandise  and  low  prices,  our  warehouses  are  notelaborat
e. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well belowthose of typical retail operations.
Our
 warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours ofoperation
 are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to thevolume
 of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing laborrequired.
 In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash,checks, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).
Our
 strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere.We
 seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700  active  stock keeping units (SKUs) perwarehous
e in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case,carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In
 keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day
 return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverageis sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise in the following categories:
•
Food  and  Sundries (including  dry  foods,  packaged  foods,  groceries,  snack  foods,  candy,  alcoholic  and  nonalcoholic  beverages,  andcleaning supplies)
•
Hardlines (including major appliances, el ectronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)•
Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) •
Softlines (including apparel and small appliances)•
Ancillary (including gasoline and phar macy businesses)Ancillary
 businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently.These
 businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouseswith gas
 stations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea, France or China. We operated 593 gas stations at the end of 
2019 . Net sales for our gasoline business represented ap proximately 11% of total net sales in 2019.Our
 e-commerce  operations  allow  us  to  connect  with  our  members  online  and  provide  additional  products  and  services,  many  not  found  in  ourwarehouses.
 At  the  end  of  2019,  we  operated  e-commerce  websites  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,  Mexico,  U.K.,  Korea,  and  Taiwan.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce represented approximately 
4%  of total net sales in 2019 .  Additionally, we offer business delivery, travel and various other services onlinein certain countries.
We
 have  direct  buying  relationships  with  many  producers  of  national  brand-name  merchandise.  We  do  not  obtain  a  significant  portion  ofmerchandise
 from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that ifcurrent
 sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. Wealso
 purchase  and  manufacture  private-label  merchandise,  as  long  as  quality  and  member  demand  are  high  and  the  value  to  our  members  issignificant.

 financial  information  for  our  segments  and  geographic  areas  is  included  in Note  11 to  the consolidated financial statements  included inItem 8 of this Report.
Membership
Our
 members  may  utilize  their  memberships  at  our  warehouses  worldwide.  Gold  Star  memberships  are  available  to  individuals;  Businessmemberships
 are  limited  to  businesses,  including  individuals  with  a  business  license,  retail  sales  license  or  comparable  document.  Businessmembers
 may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Ourannual
 fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a freehousehold card.
Our
 member renewal rate was 91%  in the U.S. and Canada and 88%  on a worldwide basis at the end of 2019 .  The majority of members renewwithin
 six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteenmonths prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):
 
2019   2018   2017 Gold Star
42,900   40,700   38,600 Business, including affiliates
11,000   10,900   10,800 Total paid members

98,500   94,300   90,300 Paid
 cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $60.Executive membersh
ips are also available in Mexico, the U.K., and Korea, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2%reward
 on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year in the U.S. and Canada and varies in Mexico, the U.K. and Korea),which
 can  be  redeemed  only  at  Costco  warehouses.  This  program  also  offers  (except  in  Mexico  and  Korea),  access  to  additional  savings  andbenefits
 on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing.These services are generally provided by third p
arties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who represented 39%  of paid members atthe end of 
2019 , generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members. Labor
Our employee count was as follows:
 
2019   2018   2017 Full-time employees
149,000   143,000   133,000 Part-time employees
105,000   102,000   98,000 Total employees
254,000   245,000   231,000 Approximately 
16,000  employees are union employees. We consid er our employee relations to be very good.5

Table of ContentsCompetition
Our
 industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy,and
 customer  service.  We  compete  on  a  worldwide  basis  with  global,  national,  and  regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,supercenters,
 internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  department  and  specialty  stores,  and  operators  selling  a  single  category  ornarrow
 range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. Wealso
 compete with other warehouse clubs (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas inthe U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple cl
ub operations.Intellectual Property
We believe that,
 to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names andsimilar
 intellectual  property  add  significant  value  to  our  business  and  are  important  to  our  success.  We  have  invested  significantly  in  thedevelopment
 and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale® trademarks  and  our  private-label  brand,  KirklandSignature
®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than nationalbrands,
 and  that  they  help  lower  costs,  differentiate  our  merchandise  offerings,  and  generally  earn  higher  margins.  We  expect  to  continue  toincrease the sales penetration of our private-labe
l items.We
 rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employeesand
 others to protect  our intellectual property.  The availability and duration of trademark  registrations  vary by country;  however, trademarks  aregenerally valid and may be renew
ed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.Available Information

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors
The
 risks  described  below  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  could  also  beaffected by
 additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us orthat
 we currently consider to be immaterial.  These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management' s Discussion andAnalysis
 of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item  7 and  our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item  8 of  thisReport.
Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our
 financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87%  and 84%  of net salesand operating income in 
2019 , respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our Ca lifornia operations, which comprised 30%  of U.S. netsales in 
2019 .  Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets.Any
 substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines infinancial
 performance  of  our U.S.  operations,  particularly  in California,  and our Canadian operations  could arise  from,  among  other  things:  slowgrowth or declines in
 comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcareand
 energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix towardlower
 gross  margin  products;  changes  or  uncertainties  in  economic  conditions  in  our  markets,  including  higher  levels  of  unemployment  anddepressed home values; and failin
g to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.We
 may  be  unsuccessful  implementing  our  growth  strategy,  including  expanding  our  business  in  existing  markets  and  new  markets,which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
 growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailersand businesses for suitable locations. Local land
 use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots,as
 well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restrictingour
 operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing,leasing
 and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Inaddition,
 certain  jurisdictions  have  enacted  or  proposed  laws  and  regulations  that  would  prevent  or  restrict  the  operation  or  expansion  plans  ofcertain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to
 effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timelybuild or lease and operate new w
arehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.We
 seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  overall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existingwarehouses and adversely affect their comparable sa
les performance, member traffic, and profitability.We
 intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets, including China. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lackof
 familiarity  with  us,  attracting  members  of  other  wholesale  club  operators,  our  lesser  familiarity  with  local  member  preferences,  and  seasonaldifferences
 in the  market.  Entry  into  new  markets  may  bring  us  into  competition  with  new  competitors  or  with  existing  competitors  with  a  large,established
 market  presence.  We  cannot  ensure  that  new warehouses  and new e-commerce  websites  will be profitable  and,  as a result,  futureprofitability could be delayed or otherw
ise materially adversely affected.8

Table of ContentsOur failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition
 could adversely affect our results of operations.Membership
 loyalty  and  growth  are  essential  to  our  business.  The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our  membership  base,  increase  thepenetration
 of Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation maynegatively
 impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue,negatively impacting our results of operations.
We
 sell  many  products  under  our  Kirkland  Signature  brand.  Maintaining  consistent  product  quality,  competitive  pricing,  and  availability  of  theseproducts
 is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also  generally  carry  higher  margins  than  national  brandproducts
 carried  in  our  warehouses  and  represent  a  growing  portion  of  our  overall  sales.  If  the  Kirkland  Signature  brand  experiences  a  loss  ofmember acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results cou
ld be adversely affected.Disruptions
 in our merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect salesand member satisfaction.
We
 depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our  depots.  We  also  rely  uponprocessing,
 packaging,  manufacturing  and  other  facilities  to  support  our  business,  which  includes  the  production  of  certain  private-label  items.Although we
 believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, laborissues
 or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adverselyaffect sales and the satisfaction of our members.
We
 may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members,the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It
 is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on ourability
 to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changingconsumer
 tastes,  preferences  (including  those  relating  to  sustainability  of  product  sources  and  animal  welfare)  and  spending  patterns  couldnegatively
 affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful atpredicting our sales trends and adjusting our
 purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns andreduce our operating performance. This could have a
n adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.We
 rely extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results, and manage our business. Failure or disruptionof
 our  primary  and  back-up  systems  could  adversely  affect  our  business.  A  failure  to  adequately  update  our  existing  systems  andimplement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.
Given
 the very high volume of transactions we process it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical systems. Oursystems,
 including  our  back-up  systems,  are  subject  to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  outages,  computer  and  telecommunications  failures,computer
 viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors ormisfeasance
 by our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix orreplace
 them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations. Any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect onour business and results of operations.
We
 are  currently  making  and  will  continue  to  make  investments  to  improve  or  advance  critical  information  systems  and  processing  capabilities.Failure
 to  monitor  and  choose  the  right  investments  and  implement  them  at  the  right  pace  could  be  harmful.  The  risk  of  system  disruption  isincreased
 when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process should mitigate this risk.Excessive technological cha
nge could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more9

Table of Contentsdifficult
 for us to realize benefits. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitmentsignificantly
 above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results ofoperations. The
 potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of ouroperations. These initiatives might not provide the a
nticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.We
 previously identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls and ifwe
 fail  to maintain  an effective  system of internal  control  in the future,  this  could  result  in  loss of investor  confidence  and adverselyimpact our stock price.
Internal
 controls  related  to  the  operation  of  technology  systems  are  critical  to  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Wereported
 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of September 2, 2018, a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective informationtechnology
 general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systemsthat
 support the Company’s financial reporting processes. During 2019, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weaknessand
 concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September  1, 2019.  Completion of remediation does not provideassurance that our remediation or
 other controls will continue to operate properly. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financialreporting
 or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financialstatements
 within required  time  periods  could be adversely  affected,  which could subject  us to  litigation  or investigations  requiring  managementresources
 and payment  of legal and other  expenses,  negatively  affect  investor  confidence  in our financial  statements  and adversely  impact  ourstock price.
If
 we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, we could damage our reputation with members andemployees, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.
We
 receive,  retain,  and  transmit  personal  information  about  our  members  and  employees  and  entrust  that  information  to  third-party  businessassociates,
 including  cloud  service-providers  that  perform  activities  for  us.  Our  warehouse  and  online  businesses  depend  upon  the  securetransmission
 of  confidential  information  over  public  networks,  including  information  permitting  cashless  payments.  A  compromise  of  our  securitysystems
 or defects within our hardware or software, or those of our business associates, that results in our members' or employees' informationbeing
 obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results ofoperations,
 financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation, government actions, or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a breachcould require expending si
gnificant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations.The
 use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated in all of our operating countries.  Privacy and information-securitylaws
 and  regulations  change,  and  compliance  with  them  may  result  in  cost  increases  due  to,  among  other  things,  systems  changes  and  thedevelopment
 of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, such as the General DataProtection
 Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business,and we could be subjected to add
itional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance.We
 have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to ourinformation
 technology network. These measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal orexternal malfeas
ance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business andpersonal
 information.  Because  the  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable  or  degrade  service,  or  sabotage  systems  changefrequently and may not im
mediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, orimplement adequate

 measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation,and potentially have an adverse effect on our bus
iness and results of operations.We are subject to payment-related risks.
We
 accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, select credit and debit cards, and our shop card. As we offer newpayment
 options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certainpayment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additi
onal transaction processing fees. We rely on third partiesto
 provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these companiesbecome
 unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules,includi
ng data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment CardIndustry
 Data  Security  Standards  (“PCI  DSS”),  which  contain  compliance  guidelines  and  standards  with  regard  to  our  security  surrounding  thephysical and electronic storage, processing and transmission
 of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, wemay
 be  liable  for  card  re-issuance  costs,  subject  to  fines  and  higher  transaction  fees  and  lose  our  ability  to  accept  card  payments  from  ourmembers, and our business and operating results coul
d be adversely affected.We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputat
ion, and expose us to litigation.If
 our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children' s products, pet products and durable goods,do
 not meet  or are perceived  not to meet  applicable safety standards  or our members'  expectations  regarding  safety,  we could experience  lostsales,
 increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members.Such
 illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence offoreign
 objects,  substances,  chemicals,  other  agents,  or  residues  introduced  during  the  growing,  manufacturing,  storage,  handling  andtransportati
on phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependenton
 them  to  ensure  that  the  products  we  buy  comply  with  safety  and  other  standards.  While  we  are  subject  to  governmental  inspection  andregulations
 and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of ourproducts
 will  not  cause  illness  or  injury  or  that  we  will  not  be  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  or  government  investigations  relating  to  such  matters,resulting
 in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liabilityclaim
 is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and ourcorporate and brand image, and these effects could be lo
ng term.If
 we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could beadversely impacted.
Omnichannel
 retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors.Our
 members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. Weare
 making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technologyin a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could b
e adversely affected.11

Table of ContentsInability
 to attract,  train and retain highly qualified  employees could adversely impact our business,  financial  condition  and results ofoperations.
Our
 success  depends  on  the  continued  contributions  of  members  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  operations,  merchandising  andadministrative
 personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact our business. Wemust
 attract,  train  and retain  a large and growing number  of qualified employees,  while controlling  related  labor costs and maintaining  our corevalues.
 Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailingwage
 rates,  and  healthcare  and  other  insurance  costs.  We  compete  with  other  retail  and  non-retail  businesses  for  these  employees  and  investsignific
ant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in thefuture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, fina
ncial condition and results of operations.We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.
The
 Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’and
 officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from verylarge
 losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatoryrequirements.
 Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or thefailure to maintain adequate insuranc
e coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Althoug
h we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damageto,
 or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruptioncaused
 by  any  such  events  to  the  extent  they  are  below  catastrophic  levels  of  coverage,  as  well  as  any  losses  to  the  extent  they  exceed  ouraggregate limits of applicable covera
ges. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.Market and Other External Risks
We
 face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations.
The
 retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with awide
 range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club
 operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operatorsselling
 a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers  and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, includingpricing,
 selection  and  availability,  services,  location,  convenience,  store  hours,  and  the  attractiveness  and  ease  of  use  of  websites  and  mobileapplications. The evolution of retail
ing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhancedcompetition.
 Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater marketpenetration
 than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations couldresult in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.
General
 economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  ofoperations.
Higher
 energy  and  gasoline  costs,  inflation,  levels  of  unemployment,  healthcare  costs,  consumer  debt  levels,  foreign-currency  exchange  rates,unsettled
 financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related togovernment fiscal and tax policies inclu
ding changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, and other12

Table of Contentseconomic
 factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability topurchase inventory. Additio
nally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to tariffimpacts
 on  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on  (among  other  things)  the  type  of  goods,  ratesimposed,
 and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising andpricing strategies in
 response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have anadverse impact on our financial results.
Prices of certain commodities, includin
g gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historicallyvolatile
 and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  labor  costs,  competition,  marketspeculation,
 government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability anddesire
 to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs andselling,
 general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions canalso be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism.
Suppliers
 may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards,resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We depend
 heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continueto
 grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change theterms
 upon which they sell to us or discontinue  selling to us. Member  demands may lead to out-of-stock  positions  leading to loss of sales andprofits.
We buy
 from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or theloss
 of  key suppliers  could negatively  affect  us. We may  not be able to develop relationships  with  new suppliers,  and products  from  alternativesources,
 if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supplymay be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consiste
ntly available.Our
 suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,financial
 liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their abilityto
 timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory, labor,environmental
 or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identifiedbefore
 we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and ourbrands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our busi
ness.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During 
2019 ,  our international  operations,  including Canada, generated 27%  and 35%  of  our  net  sales  and  operating  income,  respectively.  Ourinternational
 operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare ourconsolidated
 financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars usingcurrent
 exchange  rates.  Future  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  that  are  unfavorable  to  us  may  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  ourCanadian
 and  Other  International  operations  and  have  a  corresponding  adverse  period-over-period  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  As  wecontinue to expand internationa
lly, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.13

Table of ContentsA
 portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currencyfluctuations
 may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates mayadversely affect our results of operations.
Natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural
 disasters,  such  as  hurricanes,  typhoons  or  earthquakes,  particularly  in  California  or  Washington  state,  where  our  centralized  operatingsystems
 and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result inphysical
 damage to our properties, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of anadequate
 work  force,  the  temporary  or  long-term  disruption  in  the  supply  of  products  from  some  local  or  overseas  suppliers,  the  temporarydisruptio
n in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction inthe availabil
ity of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt theoperations
 of suppliers or members,  or have an adverse  impact on consumer  spending and confidence levels. These events could also reducedemand
 for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of ourlocations, which could have a material a
dverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We
 use natural  gas, diesel fuel,  gasoline,  and electricity  in our distribution  and warehouse operations.  U.S.  and foreign  government  regulationslimiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions
 may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energyinputs
 could materially affect our profitability. Climate change and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, andsnow or ice storms, as well as
 rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. Wealso
 sell  a  substantial  amount  of  gasoline,  the  demand  for  which  could  be  impacted  by  concerns  about  climate  change  and  which  could  faceincreased regulation.
Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We
 believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay inmeeting
 these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new membersign-ups,
 gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the marketprice of our stock to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Our
 international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economicfactors
 specific  to  the  countries  or  regions  in  which  we  operate,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  andresults of operations.
At
 the  end  of 2019 ,  we  operated 239  warehouses  outside  of  the  U.S.,  and  we  plan  to  continue  expanding  our  international  operations.  Futureoperating
 results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which arebeyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditi
ons, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as theU.K.'s
 vote to withdraw from the European Union, commonly known as "Brexit", and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which weoperate,
 now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions),monetary
 and  fiscal  policies  and  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  U.S.  and  foreign  governments,  agencies  and  similar  organizations,  and  risksassociated
 with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operationsalso include, among others, the costs and difficulties of
14

erations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.Changes
 in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accountingmatters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting
 principles  and  related  pronouncements,  implementation  guidelines,  and  interpretations  we  apply  to  a  wide range  of  matters  that  arerelevant to our business, including self-insur
ance liabilities and income taxes, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates andjudgments
 by  our  management.  Changes  in  rules  or  interpretation  or  changes  in  underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  ourmanagement
 could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financialstatements.
We could be subject to additional tax liabilities.
We
 are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at anypoint
 in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognizeadditional
 tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax  liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,  administrativepractices,
 principles,  assessments  by  authorities  and  interpretations  related  to  tax,  including  tax  rules  in  various  jurisdictions.  We  compute  ourincome
 tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earningsattributable
 to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changesin
 the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.
Significant
 changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials,hazardous
 and  non-hazardous  wastes  and  other  environmental  matters  could  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition  andresults of operations.
We
 are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge anddisposal
 of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws couldresult
 in  harm  to  our  members,  employees  or  others,  significant  costs  to  satisfy  environmental  compliance,  remediation  or  compensatoryrequirements,
 or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect ourbusiness, financial conditio
n and results of operations.We
 are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
Our
 business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  otherproceedings, and lead to damage a
wards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedingsand
 audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws,and
 other  litigation.  We  cannot  predict  with  certainty  the  outcomes  of  these  proceedings  and  other  contingencies,  including  environmentalremediation
 and  other  proceedings  commenced  by  governmental  authorities.  The  outcome  of  some  of  these  proceedings,  audits,  unclaimedproperty
 laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or couldrequire
 us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending againstthese lawsuits and proceedings may inv
olve significant expense and diversion of management' s attention and resources.15

 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (amounts  in millions, except per share,share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)
Overview
We
 believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales assales
 from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websitesoperating
 for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing membersand
 the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyondour
 control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); changes in thecost
 of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions;  and  changes  from  the  revenue  recognition  standard.  The  higher  our  comparable  salesexclusive
 of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage ofsales
 and  enhancing  profitability.  Generating  comparable  sales  growth  is  foremost  a  question  of  making  available  to  our  members  the  rightmerchandise
 at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in salesgrowth
 is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Salesgrowth
 and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national andregiona
l wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic healthor
 changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful  historically  in  adapting  our  business  to  these  changes,  such  as  throughadjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, includi
ng increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.Our
 philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizingprices
 charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  on  quality  goods  –consistently
 providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drivesales
 or  meet  competition  and holding prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on to  our  members,  all negativelyimpacting
 gross  margin  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales  (gross  margin  percentage).  We  believe  that  our  gasoline  business  draws  members  but  itgenerally
 has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  non-gasoline  business.  A  higher  penetration  of  gasoline  sales  willgenerally
 lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally,rising
 gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreasesour
 selling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales.  A  decline  in  gasoline  prices  has  the  inverse  effect.Additionally,
 actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect thecosts
 of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timingof
 the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to costincreases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they cou
ld have an adverse impact on our results.We
 also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult tosecure, and
 square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however,including lower
 initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occurin
 existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth isgenerally
 higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth,domestically and international
ly, has also increased our sales.20

Table of ContentsThe
 membership  format  is  an  integral  part  of  our  business  and  has  a  significant  effect  on  our  profitability.  This  format  is  designed  to  reinforcemember loyalty and provide continuing fee reve
nue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of ourExecutive
 members,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially  influences  our  profitability.  Our  paid  membership  growth  rate  may  be  adverselyimpacted when warehouse ope
nings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.Our
 financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significantcosts
 are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, ourphilosophy
 is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employeeturnover
 and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of ourworkforce.
 This  may cause us, for  example,  to absorb costs  that  other  employers  might  seek to pass  through  to their  workforces.  Because ourbusiness
 is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandisecosts and selling, general and admi
nistrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our
 operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11  to  the consolidatedfinancial
 statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of squarefootage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percenta
ge of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition.In
 discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which arereferences
 to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from localcurrencies
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the differencebetween
 the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on netsales is calculated based on the differenc
e between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our
 fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2019  and 2018  relate  to the 52-week fiscal years ended September  1,2019
,  and September  2, 2018,  respectively. References to 2017  relate  to the 53-week fiscal year ended September  3, 2017.  Certain percentagespresented are calculated using
 actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable toCostco.
Highlights for 
2019  included: •
We opened 25  new warehouses, including 5  relocations: 16  net new locations in the U.S. and 4  in our Other International segment, includingour first warehouse in China, compared to 
25  new warehouses, including 4  relocations in 2018 ; •
Net sales increased 8%  to $149,351 driven by a 6%  increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2018 and 2019;•
Membership fee revenue increased 7%  to $3,352,  primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the annual feeincrease in the U
.S. and Canada in June 2017.•
Gross  margin  percentage  decreased two  basis  points.  Excluding  the  impact  of  the  new  revenue  recognition  standard  on  net  sales,  grossmargin as a percentage of adjusted net sales increas
ed eight basis points;•
Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased two  basis points. Excluding the impact of the newrevenue
 recognition standard on net sales, SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales increased 11 basis points, primarily related to a $123charge for a product tax assessment;
21

Table of Contents•
Effective March 2019, starting and supervisor wages were increased and paid bonding leave was made available for hourly employees in theU.S. and Canada. The estimated annual
ized pre-tax cost of these increases is approximately $50-$60;•
The effective tax rate in 2019 was 22.3% compared to 28.4% in 2018. Both years were favorably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017Tax Act) and other net tax benefits;
•
Net income increased 17%  to $3,659, or $8.26 per diluted share compared to $3,134 , or $7.09 per diluted share in 2018 ; and •
In April 2019,  the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57  to $0.65 per  share and authorized a newshare repurchase program in the amount of $4,000.

Net
 sales increased $10,917  or 8% during 2019 ,  primarily due to a 6%  increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2018and 2019.
Changes
 in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,463, or 106 basis points, compared to2018, attributab

line prices did not have a material impact on net sales.Comparable Sales
Comparable
 sales  increased 6%  during 2019  and  were  positively  impacted  by  increases  in  both  shopping  frequency  and  average  ticket.Comparable sales were negative

 gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage ofcore
 merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased seven basis points primarily due to increases in food and sundries and fresh foodspartially
 offset by decreases in softlines and hardlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins fromour warehouse ancillary
 and other businesses.Total
 gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on netsales,
 gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.12%, an increase of eight basis points. This increase was primarily due to a 19basis
 point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. This increase was partially offset bydecreases
 of four basis points in our core merchandise categories, four basis points due to an adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewardsearned
 under our co-branded credit card program and three basis points due to increased spending by members under the Executive Membership2% reward program. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dol
lar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $155 in 2019.The
 segment  gross  margin  percentage,  when  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  segment's  own  sales  and  excluding  the  impact  of  changes  ingasoline
 prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operations, predominantly in our warehouse ancillary andother
 businesses,  primarily  our  gasoline  business.  This  increase  was  partially  offset  by  decreases  in  our  core  merchandise  categories  and  thebreakage
 adjustment noted above. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased predominantly in hardlines andsoftlines
 and certain of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by an increase in fresh foods. The segment gross marginpercentage
 in  our  Other  International  operations  decreased  primarily  in  our  core  merchandise  categories  and  due  to  the  introduction  of  theExecutive Membership 2% reward program in Korea. This decrease w

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our signific
ant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 
2019   2018   2017 Net cash provided by operating activities
$ 6,356  $5,774  $6,726 Net cash used in investing activities
(2,865 )  (2,947 )  (2,366 ) Net cash used in financing activities
(1,147 )  (1,281 )  (3,218 ) Our primary sources
 of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cashand
 cash equivalents and short-term investments were $9,444  and $7,259  at  the end of 2019  and 2018 ,  respectively. Of these balances, unsettledcredit
 and  debit  card  receivables  represented  approximately $1,434  and $1,348  at  the  end  of  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  These  receivablesgenerally
 settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $15  and $37  in 2019 and 2018
, respectively, and positively impacted by $25 in 20 17.Management
 believes  that  our  cash  position  and  operating  cash  flows  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  theforeseeable
 future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longerconsider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consoli
dated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.25

Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating Activities
Net
 cash provided by operating activities totaled $6,356  in 2019,  compared to $5,774  in 2018.  Our cash flow provided by operations is primarilyderived
 from  net  sales  and  membership  fees.  Cash  flow  used  in  operations  generally  consists  of  payments  to  our  merchandise  suppliers,warehouse
 operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operationsalso
 includes  payments  for  income  taxes.  Changes  in  our  net  investment  in  merchandise  inventories  (the  difference  between  merchandiseinventories
 and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and theamount of payables paid early to obtain disc
ounts from our suppliers.Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net
 cash used in investing activities totaled $2,865  in 2019,  compared to $2,947  in 2018,  and primarily related to capital expenditures. Net  cashflows from investing activities also includes maturities an
d purchases of short-term investments.Capital Expenditures
Our
 primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required forinformation
 systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. In  2019,  we spent $2,998 on capitalexpenditures,
 and it is our current intention to spend approximately  $3,000 to $3,200 during  fiscal 2020. These expenditures are expected to befinanced with cash
 from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 25 new warehouses, including five relocations, in 
2019 , and plan to open approximately 22 add itional new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2020. There can be no assurancethat current expectations will be realized and p
lans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net
 cash used in financing activities totaled $1,147  in 2019,  compared to $1,281  in 2018.  Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related tothe
 payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. Dividends totaling $1,038  were paid during 2019,
 of which $250 related to the dividend declared in August 2018. In August 2019, approximately $200 and $100 of Guaranteed Senior Noteswere issued by our Japanese subsid
iary at fixed interest rates of 0.28% and 0.42%, respectively.Stock Repurchase Programs
In
 April  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  new  share  repurchase  program  in  the  amount  of  $4,000,  which  expires  in  April  2023.  Thisauthorization
 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,237 . During 2019  and 2018 , we repurchased 1,097,000  and 1,756,000 shares
 of  common  stock,  at  average  prices  of $225.16  and $183.13 ,  respectively,  totaling  approximately $247  and $322 ,  respectively.  Theremaining
 amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,943  at  the end of 2019 .  These amounts may differ from the stockrepurchase
 balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of eachfiscal
 year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans underSEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchase
d shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.Dividends
Cash
 dividends declared in 2019  totaled $2.44  per  share, as compared to $2.14  per  share in 2018 .  In April 2019 ,  the Board of Directors increasedour
 quarterly cash dividend from $0.57  to $0.65 per  share. In August 2019 ,  the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amountof 
$0.65 per share, which was paid subsequent to the end of 20 19.26

Table of ContentsBank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital an
d general corporate purposes. At September 1, 2019 , we had borrowing capacity under these facilities
 of  $865,  including a $400 revolving  line of  credit,  which expires  in June 2020.  The Company  currently  has no plans to  draw  upon thisfacility.
 Our international operations maintain $355 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $150 is guaranteed by theCompany. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings und
er the bank credit facilities at the end of 2019  and 2018 . The
 Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $219. The outstanding commitments under thesefacilities at
 the end of 2019  totaled $145,  most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilitieshave
 various  expiration  dates,  most  of  which  are  within  one  year,  and  we  generally  intend  to  renew  these  facilities.  The  amount  of  borrowingsavailable at any time under our bank credit faciliti

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current orfuture
 effect on our financial condition or financial statements, other than operating leases, included in the table above and discussed in Note 1  and Note 5
 to the consolidated financial statements inclu ded in Item 8 of this Report.27

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Estimates
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requiresthat
 we  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  andliabilities
 at  the date of the  financial statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and expenses during  the reporting  period.  We  base ourestimates
 on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates.For
 further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1  to  the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of thisReport.
Insurance/Self-insu
rance LiabilitiesThe
 Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’and officers’ liability, vehicle lia
bility, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to seek to limit exposures arising fromvery
 large  losses.  We  use  different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary,  and  participate  in  areinsurance
 program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience,demographic
 factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result ofinflation
 rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time. While we believe our estimates are reasonable andprovide
 for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities.Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.

 determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application ofcomplex
 tax laws. Significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability ofsustaining
 uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a more-likely-than-notprobability
 that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions andrecord
 any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. The 2017 Tax Act includes various provisions that significantly alteredU.S. tax law, many of which impact our business (see 
Note 8  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See 
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inclu ded in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
(amounts in millions) Our
 exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  inspeculative or leveraged transactions or hol
d or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk
Our
 exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instrumentsconsidered
 to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1  to  the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term
 investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. Theprimary
 objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investmentsare in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair val
ue due to interest rate fluctuations.28

Table of ContentsOur
 policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized byU.S.
 government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances.Our
 wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  invests  in  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  obligations  and  U.S.  government  andgovernment
 agency  money  market  funds.  Our  Canadian and  Other  International  subsidiaries’  investments  are  primarily  in money  market  funds,bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of depos
it, generally denominated in local currencies.A
 100 basis-point change in interest rates as of the end of 2019  would  have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For thoseinvestments
 that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates arereflected within stockholders’ equity in accumu
lated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.The
 nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of2019
, long-term debt  with fixed interest rates was $6,852 .  Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4  to the consolidated financial statements inc
luded in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.Foreign Currency Risk
Our
 foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We managethese fluctuations, in part,
 through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations onknown
 future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposureto U.S. dollar merchandise inventory
 expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Weseek to
 mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to theCompany's
 forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes  1 and 3  to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Ahypothetical
 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at September  1, 2019,  wouldhave
 decreased the fair value of the contracts by $79 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the sameamount.
Commodity Price Risk
We
 are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturingoperations,
 which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in theU.S.
 and  Canada.  We  also  enter  into  variable-priced  contracts  for  some  purchases  of  electricity  and  natural  gas,  in  addition  to  fuel  for  our  gasstations,
 on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases andnormal sales” exception under authoritative gu
idance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.29

Costco Wholesale Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated
 Financial StatementsWe
 have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  subsidiaries  (the  Company)  as  ofSeptember
 1, 2019 and September  2, 2018,  the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the52-week
 period ended September  1, 2019,  the 52-week period ended September  2, 2018 and  the 53-week period ended September  3, 2017, and the
 related  notes  (collectively,  the  consolidated  financial  statements).  In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  allmaterial
 respects, the financial position of the Company as of September  1, 2019 and September  2, 2018,  and the results of its operations and itscash
 flows  for  the  52-week  period  ended September  1,  2019,  the  52-week  period  ended September  2,  2018 and  the  53-week  period  endedSeptember 3, 2017
, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting princ iples.We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theCompany’s internal control over financia
l reporting as of September 1, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 10, 2019 expressed anunqualified opini
on on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Basis for Opinion
These
 consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on theseconsolidated
 financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  beindependent
 with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  theSecurities and Exchange Commissio
n and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Ouraudits included
 performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error orfraud,
 and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  theamounts
 and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates
 made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our auditsprovide a reasonable basi
s for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The
 critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that werecommunicated
 or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  theconsolidated
 financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical auditmatters
 does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating thecritical audit matters below, providing separate opi
nions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.30

Table of ContentsEvaluation of self
-insurance liabilitiesAs
 discussed in Note 1  to  the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claimsexperience,
 demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of September 1, 2019were $
1,222  million. We
 identified  the  evaluation  of  the  Company’s  self-insurance  liabilities  as  a  critical  audit  matter  because  of  the  specialized  skills  necessary  toevaluate
 the  Company’s  actuarial  models  and  the  judgments  required  to  assess  the  underlying  assumptions  made  by  the  Company.  Keyassumptio
ns underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates include: reporting and payment patterns used in the projections of the ultimate loss; lossand
 exposure trends; the selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the Paid and Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods; and theselection of the ultimate loss derived from the various methods.
The
 primary  procedures  we  performed  to  address  this  critical  audit  matter  included  the  following.  We  tested  certain  internal  controls  over  theCompany’s
 self-insurance  process.  Such  controls  included  controls  over  the  (a)  evaluation  of  claims  information  sent  to  the  actuary,  (b)development
 and selection of the key assumptions  used in the actuarial calculation, and (c) review of the actuarial report and evaluation of theexternal
 actuarial  expert’s  qualifications,  competency,  and  objectivity.  We  tested  the  claims  data  used  in  the  actuarial  calculation  by  selecting  asample and checking key attributes such as date of loss. We involve
d actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:•
Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards;•
Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual loss payments;•
Evaluating the key assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insuranceliabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorde
d by the Company; and•
Evaluating the qualifications of the Company’s actuaries by assessing their certifications, and determining whether they met the QualificationStandards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render the statements of actuarial opini
on implicit in their analyses.Performance of incremental audit procedures over IT financial reportin
g processesAs
 of  September  2,  2018,  the  Company  identified  a  material  weakness  in  internal  control  related  to  ineffective  information  technology  generalcontrols
 (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology (IT) systems that support theCompany’s
 financial reporting processes. Automated and manual business process controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were alsodeemed
 ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. While our report dated October 10, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinionon
 the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019, during a portion of the 52-week periodended
 September 1, 2019, the ITGCs were ineffective and the information or system generated reports produced by the affected financial reportingsystems
 could not be relied upon without further testing. We identified the performance of the necessary incremental audit procedures over thefinancial
 information reliant on the impacted IT systems as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was required to design and executethe
 incremental audit procedures and to assess the sufficiency of the procedures performed and evidence obtained due to ineffective controls andthe complexity of the Company’s IT environment.
The primary
 procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We involved IT professionals with specialized skillsand
 knowledge to assist in the identification and design of the incremental procedures. We modified the types of procedures that were performed,which included:
•
Testing the underlying records of selected transaction data obtained from the impacted IT systems to support the use of the information in theconduct of the audit; and
31

Table of Contents•
Involving  forensic  professionals  with  specialized  skills  and  knowledge  in  data  analysis  to  perform  an  evaluation  of  the  journal  entry  data,including
 assessing that the entire population of automated and manual transactions has been identified. Forensic professionals also assistedwith
 the  identification  of  certain  entries  that  required  additional  testing  and  for  all  such  entries,  we  agreed  the  journal  entry  data  to  sourcedocuments.
We evaluated the collective results of
 the incremental audit procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to theinformation produced by the impacted IT systems.
Evaluation of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act
As
 discussed in Note 8  to  the consolidated financial statements, H.R. 1, the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (2017 Tax Act) contains numerous provisionsimpacting
 the computation of the Company’s U.S. federal and state corporate income tax provision, including the Global Intangible Low Tax Income(GILTI),
 Foreign Derived Intangibles Income (FDII) and Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) provisions. For the year ended September 1, 2019, the Companyrecognized net tax benefits of $123 million rel
ated to the 2017 Tax Act.We
 identified the evaluation of the Company’s implementation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act as a critical audit matter. A high degree ofjudgment
 was required to interpret the impact of the new tax law on the Company, especially given the complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and relatedTreasury
 Regulations. Further, evaluating the Company’s application of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions of the 2017 Tax Act required complexauditor judgment.
The
 primary  procedures  we  performed  to  address  this  critical  audit  matter  included  the  following.  We  tested  certain  internal  controls  over  theCompany’s
 income tax process, including controls over the (a) identification and interpretation of the relevant provisions of the 2017 Tax Act andrelated Treasury Regulations and
 (b) calculation of the impact of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions. We involved tax professionals with specializedskills
 and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Company’s interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Act. They developed an independentassessment
 of the impact of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions based on our understanding and interpretation, and compared it to the net taxbenefits the Company recognized related to the 20
17 Tax Act./s/ KPMG LLP

 on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  theTreadway
 Commission.  In  our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  ofSeptember
 1,  2019,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission.
We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  theconsolidated
 balance sheets of the Company as of September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income,comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week p
eriod ended September 1, 2019, the 52-week period ended September 2, 2018 andthe
 53-week  period  ended  September  3,  2017,  and  the  related  notes  (collectively,  the  consolidated  financial  statements),  and  our  report  datedOctober 10, 2019 expressed an unqualifi
ed opinion on those consolidated financial statements.Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  theeffectiveness
 of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  OverFinancial
 Reporting (Item  9A).  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on ouraudit.
 We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applic
able rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtainreasonable
 assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internalcontrol
 over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a materialweakness
 exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit alsoincluded
 performing  such  other  procedures  as we considered  necessary  in the circumstances.  We  believe that  our audit  provides  a reasonablebasis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Fina
ncial ReportingA
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over fina
ncial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of anyevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inad
equate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate./s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or
 the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based onthe
 concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandisecategorie
s will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At September 1, 2019 , Costco operated 782  warehouses worldwide: 543  in
the United States (U.S.) located in 44  states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100  in Canada, 39  in Mexico, 29  in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 
16  in Korea, 13  in Taiwan, 11  in Australia, two  in Spain, and one  each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commercewebsites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan.
Basis of Presentation
The
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controllinginterest.
 The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. Allmaterial inter-company transactions
 between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. TheCompany’s
 net  income  excludes  income  attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  in  Taiwan.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  the  Companypurchased
 its former joint-venture partner's remaining equity interest in its Korean operations. Unless otherwise noted, references to net incomerelate to net income attributable to Costco.
Fiscal Year End
The
 Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2019  and 2018 relate
 to the 52-week fiscal years ended September  1, 2019,  and September  2, 2018,  respectively. References to 2017  relate  to the 53-week fiscalyear ended 
September 3, 2017 . Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. general
ly accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to makeestimates and assumptio
ns that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from thoseestimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
 Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at thedate
 of  purchase,  and  proceeds  due  from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  with  settlement  terms  of  up  to  four  days.  Credit  and  debit  cardreceivables were $
1,434  and $ 1,348  at the end o f 2019  and 2018 , respectively. The
 Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of2019
 and 2018  are  $673  and $463 , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which thepayments were drawn.
The accompanying notes are an integral p
art of these consolidated financial statements.39

Table of ContentsShort-Term Investments
In
 general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond fiveyears
 may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent theinvestment of cash that
 is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using thespecific
 identification  method  with  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  reflected  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  realized.Realized
 gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded ininterest
 income  and  other,  net  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Short-term  investments  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are  financialinstruments
 that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasuredto fair value on a recurring basis.
The
 Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative andquantitative
 criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the loss in interest incomeand other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
 Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash andcash
 equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2 , 3,and 
4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.Fair
 value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer  a liability in an orderly transaction  between marketparticipants
 at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observableinputs when measuring fair value. The three leve
ls of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservab
le inputs that are corroborated by market data.Level 3: Significant unobservab
le inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such asquoted net asset
 values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all othernon-derivative
 financial  instruments  are  based  on  independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  ofindependent
 external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves includingbut not limited to 
treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can bederived
 principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable,using the fair value of the individual sec
urities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.Current
 financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-termdebt,
 which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, andare
 being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily onreported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon i
nterest rates, maturities, and credit.40

Table of ContentsReceivables, Net
Receivables
 consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables includevolume
 rebates  or  other  discounts.  Balances  are  generally  presented  on  a  gross  basis,  separate  from  any  related  payable  due.  In  certaincircumstances,
 these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a netbasis.
 Reinsurance  receivables  are  held  by  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  and  primarily  represent  amounts  cededthrough
 reinsurance  arrangements  gross  of  the  amounts  assumed  under  reinsurance,  which  are  presented  within  other  current  liabilities  in  theconsoli
dated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangement inthe
 U.S. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amountsdue from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.
Receivables
 are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specificidentification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial in 
2019 , 2018, and 2017 . Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the followi
ng: 
2019   2018 United States
$ 8,415  $8,081 Canada
1,123  1,189 Other Inte
rnational1,857  1,770 Merchandise inventories
$ 11,395   $11,040 Merchandise inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, usingthe
 last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matchingcurrent
 costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation ordeflation, and these estimates are
 adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels havebeen
 determined. As of September  1, 2019 and September  2, 2018,  U.S. merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated first-in, first-out(FIFO)
 after considering the lower of cost or market principle. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valuedusing the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the FIFO basis.
The
 Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based onthe Company’s experie
nce. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourthfiscal
 quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towardsearning those rebates, provided that they are probabl
e and reasonably estimable.Property and Equipment
Property
 and equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with an estimated useful life,generally 
five  to fifty years  for  buildings and improvements  and three  to twenty years  for  equipment  and fixtures.  Depreciation  and amortizationexpense is computed using the straight-line metho
d over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after thebeginning
 of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial leaseplus any renewals that are reasonably assure
d at the date the leasehold improvements are made.The
 Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use.During development, these costs are include
d in construction in41

Table of Contentsprogress.
 When the assets are ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-linebasis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally 
three  to seven years. Repair
 and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or changethe
 way an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement areretired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 
2019  and 2018  were immate rial.The
 Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes incircumstances
 may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For assetgroups
 held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimatedfuture
 undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In theevent
 that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to theexcess
 of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), thecarrying
 value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisalsfrom third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charg
es recognized in 2019 , 2018 or 2017. Insurance/Self-insu
rance LiabilitiesThe
 Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’and
 officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from verylarge
 losses. It uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates ina
 reinsurance  program.  Liabilities associated  with  the risks  that  are  retained  by the  Company are not discounted  and are estimated,  in part,  byconsidering
 historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for theseliabilities
 could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2019  and 2018
,  these insurance liabilities were $1,222  and  $1,148  in  the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits andother current liabilities in the consolid
ated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.The
 captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, inthe
 consolidated  statements  of  income.  The  captive  participates  in  a  reinsurance  program  that  includes  other  third-party  participants.  Thereinsuran
ce agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement ofthe
 next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Incomestatement
 adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as informationbecomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior
activity.
Derivatives
The
 Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,through
 the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on knownfuture
 expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventoryexpenditures
 made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts donot
 qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage inspeculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contin
gent features that require settlement of outstanding42

Table of Contentscontracts
 upon certain triggering events. At the end of 2019  and 2018 ,  the aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liabilityposition
 and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial.The
 aggregate  notional  amounts  of  open,  unsettled  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts  were  $704  and  $717  at  the  end  of 2019  and 2018 , respectively. See 
Note 3  for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2019  and 2018 . The
 unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to thenet changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exch
ange contracts were immaterial in 2019 , 2018, and 2017 . The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electric
ity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail andmanufacturing
 operations,  which  it  seeks  to  partially  mitigate  through  the  use  of  fixed-price  contracts  for  certain  of  its  warehouses  and  otherfacilitie
s, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition tofuel
 for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normalpurchases or normal sales” exception under authoritativ
e guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.Foreign Currency
The
 functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assetsand
 liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded inaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company’s  consolidated  foreign  operations  are  translated  at  averageexchange rates pre
vailing during the year.The
 Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin currencies other than the functional currency in interest income an
d other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally,these
 include  the  U.S.  dollar  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  the  U.S.  dollar  payables  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  revalued  to  their  functionalcurrency.
 Also included are realized foreign-currency  gains or losses from settlements  of forward foreign-exchange contracts.  These items wereimmaterial fo
r 2019 , 2018, and 2017 . Revenue Recognition
The
 Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable,and
 is  net  of  sales  taxes  collected  and  remitted  to  government  agencies  and  returns.  The  Company  reserves  for  estimated  returns  based  onhistorical
 trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refundliability
 and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balancesheets.
Merchandise
 Sales - The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, andfresh
 foods.  The  Company  also  provides  expanded  products  and  services  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  The  majority  ofrevenue
 from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is recognized uponshipment
 to the member to the extent there is no installation provided as a part of the contract. For merchandise shipped directly to the member,shipping
 and  handling  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  as  fulfillment  costs  and  included  in  merchandise  costs  in  the  consolidated  statements  ofincome.
 In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are includedin other current liabilities in the consoli
dated balance sheets.Principal Versus Agent
 - The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company isthe
 principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco isprimarily responsible
43

Table of Contentsfor
 merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricingdiscretion.
Membership Fees - The
 Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membershipperiod. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2019 and 201
8 were $1,711  and $1,624 , respectively. In
 certain countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $1,000per
 year), which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales,net
 of  the  estimated  impact  of  non-redemptions  (breakage),  with  the  corresponding  liability  classified  as  accrued  member  rewards  in  theconsolidated
 balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2019 ,   2018 and  2017, the net reduction in saleswas 
$1,537, $1,394, and $1,281  respectively. Shop
 Cards - The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or onlinefor
 merchandise  or  membership.  Revenue  from  shop  cards  is  recognized  upon  redemption,  and  estimated  breakage  is  recognized  based  onredemption
 data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Previously, theshop cards were branded as cash cards.
Co-Branded
 Credit  Card  Program  -  Citibank,  N.A.  (“Citi”)  became  the  exclusive  issuer  of  co-branded  credit  cards  to  U.S.  members  in  June2016.
 The Company receives various forms of consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion ofwhich, after
 giving rise to estimated breakage, is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire onDecember 31. Breakage is estimated based on redempti
on data.Merchandise Costs
Merchandise
 costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costsrelated
 to  the  Company’s  depot  and  fulfillment  operations,  including  freight  from  depots  to  selling  warehouses,  and  are  reduced  by  vendorconsideration. Merchandise costs also incl
ude salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.Vendor Consideration
The
 Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced bysigned
 agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebateor
 discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reductionof merchandise costs upon completion of contractual mileston
es, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.Selling, General and Ad
ministrative ExpensesSelling,
 general  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  benefits  and  workers’  compensation  costs  for  warehouse  employees(other
 than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and homeoffice
 employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative  expenses also include substantially  all building and equipmentdepreciation,
 stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  supportwarehouse and e-commerce website operatio

Table of ContentsRetirement Plans
The
 Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days  of  employment. The planallows
 participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligibleparticipant
 an  annual  discretionary  contribution.  The  Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  Canadian  employees  and  contributes  apercentage
 of  each  employee's  wages.  Certain  subsidiaries  in  the  Company's  Other  International  operations  have  defined  benefit  and  definedcontribution
 plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $614 , $578, and $543  for 2019, 2018, and 2017 , respectively, and are predominantly included in se
lling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.Stock-Based Compensation
Restricted
 stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five  years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based
 awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures arerecognized as they occur.
Compensation
 expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for theentire
 award.  Awards  for  employees  and  non-employee  directors  provide  for  accelerated  vesting  of  a  portion  of  outstanding  shares  based  oncumulative
 years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service
 term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value ofthe
 award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date lessthe present value of the expected dividends forgo
ne during the vesting period.Stock-based
 compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements ofincome. Certain stock-based compensation costs
 are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7  for additional in formation on theCompany’s stock-ba
sed compensation plans.Leases
The
 Company  leases  land  and/or  buildings  at  warehouses  and  certain  other  office  and  distribution  facilities,  primarily  under  operating  leases.Operating
 leases expire at various dates through 2068 ,  with the exception of one lease in the U.K., which expires in 2151 .  These leases generallycontain
 one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal for a defined numberof
 years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase of the property at the then-fair market value; or(c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer.
The
 Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of thelease and
 any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property.Certain leases provide for periodic rental incre
ases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume.The
 Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2059 .  Capital lease assets are included in landand
 buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded asdepreciation
 expense  and  is  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Capital  lease  liabilities  are  recorded  at  the  lesser  of  theestimated
 fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included inother
 current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest on these obligations is included in interestexpense in the consolidated statements of income.

Table of ContentsThe Company
 records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where itis
 considered  the  owner  for  accounting  purposes,  to  the  extent  the  Company  is  involved  in  the  construction  of  the  building  or  structuralimprovements
 or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangementsqualify
 for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for thearrangement as a financing lease.
The
 Company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. Theseobligations
 are generally recorded as a discounted liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fairvalue
 of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The AROassets
 are  depreciated  using  the  same  depreciation  method  as  the  leasehold  improvement  assets  and  are  included  with  buildings  andimprovements.
 Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases were immaterial  at  the end of 2019  and 2018 ,  respectively, and are includedin other liabilities in
 the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Preopening Expenses
Preopening
 expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets,new manufacturing and distribution facil
ities, and expansions at existing warehouses and are expensed as incurred.Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future taxconsequences
 attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective taxbases
 and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxableincome
 in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxassets
 and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized  in  income  in  the  period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  A  valuation  allowance  isestablished when necessary to reduce d
eferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.The
 timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. Thebenefits
 of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-notprobability
 that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the  Companyreassesses these probabilities and records a
ny changes as appropriate.Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The
 computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  Thecomputation
 of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus thenumber
 of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stockmethod for shares subject to RSUs.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased
 shares of common stock are retired,  in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchasedshares
 is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital andretained
 earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and isapplied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaini
ng amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6  for additional in formation.46

 of  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers.  The  guidance  requires  disclosures  sufficient  to  describe  the  nature,  amount,  timing,  anduncertainty
 of revenue and cash flows. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective approach,and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of 
$16  as an increase to retained earnings, which is included in cash dividend declared and other in theconsolidated statements of equity.
The
 standard impacted the presentation and timing of certain revenue transactions. Specifically, the changes included gross presentation of theCompany’s
 estimate  of  merchandise  returns  reserve  and  the  related  recoverable  assets,  recognizing  shop  card  breakage  over  the  period  ofredemption,
 and  accelerating  the  recognition  of  certain  e-commerce  and  special-order  sales.  Additionally,  the  Company’s  evaluation  under  thestandard of its status as a principal in certain revenue arrangements resulte
d in the recognition of additional sales on a gross basis.The
 effect  of  the  standard  on  the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheet  was  an  increase  to  other  current  liabilities  and  other  current  assetsof 
$649 and $698  at  adoption  and  at  the  end  of 2019 ,  respectively,  related  to  the  estimate  of  merchandise  returns  reserve  and  the  relatedrecoverable assets.
The effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company's consol
idated statement of income is as follows:

nts Not Yet AdoptedIn
 February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires recognition on the balance sheet of rights and obligations created by leases withterms
 greater than twelve months. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15,2018,
 with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and utilize thetransition
 option,  which  allows  for  a  cumulative-effect  adjustment  in  the  period  of  adoption  and  does  not  require  application  of  the  guidance  tocomparative
 periods. The primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations for current operatingleases.
 The Company has substantially completed its assessment of the new standard and estimates total assets and liabilities will increase byapproximately 
$2,400  upon  adoption. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated statements of incomeor cash flows. The Company continues to evaluate the relate
d disclosure requirements.47

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The
 Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  all  executive  officers  areperformance-based.
 Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented bythe Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary terminatio
n. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service withthe
 Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. On January 24, 2019, shareholders approved theadoption
 of  the  2019  Incentive  Plan,  which  replaced  the  Seventh  Restated  2002  Stock  Incentive  Plan  (Seventh  Plan).  The  2019  Incentive  Planauthorized
 the issuance of 17,500,000  shares ( 10,000,000  RSUs)  of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were availablefor
 grant under the Seventh Plan on January 24, 2019 and future forfeited shares from grants under the Seventh Plan up to a maximum aggregateof 
27,800,000 shares  (15,885,000  RSUs).  The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs aregenerally delivered to participa
nts annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
RSUs
 granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five  and three  years,  respectively. Additionally, the terms of theRSUs,
 including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25  ormore
 and five  or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested andundelivered shares. At the end of

 December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. Except for certain provisions, the 2017 Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on orafter January
 1, 2018. The Company is a fiscal-year taxpayer, so most provisions became effective for 2019, including limitations on the Company’sability
 to claim foreign tax credits, repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, and limitations on certain business deductions. Provisions withsignificant
 impacts that were effective starting in the second quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019 included: a decrease in the U.S. federal incometax
 rate, remeasurement of certain net deferred tax liabilities, and a transition tax on deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. The decreasein the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to 
21.0%  was effective for all of 2019 and resulted in a blend ed rate for the Company of 25.6%  for 2018. The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate is as follows:

 of deemed foreign dividends, partially offset by losses of current year foreign tax credits. During 2018, the Company recognized a net taxexpense
 of $19  related  to  the  2017  Tax  Act.  This  expense  included $142  for  the  estimated  tax  on  deemed  repatriation  of  foreign  earnings,and 
$43 for the reduction in foreign tax credits and other immaterial items, largely offset by a tax benefit of $166  for  the remeasurement of certaindeferred tax liabilities.

 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized total net tax benefits of $221  and $57 , which included a benefit of $59  and $33 , respectively, related tothe
 stock-based  compensation  accounting  standard  adopted  in  2018  in  addition  to  the  impacts  of  the  2017  Tax  Act  noted  above.  In  2017,  theCompany
’ s  provision  for  income  taxes  was  favorably  impacted  by  a  net  tax  benefit  of $104 ,  primarily  due  to  the $82  tax  benefit  recorded  inconnection
 with the May 2017 special cash dividends paid by the Company to employees through the Company's 401(k) retirement plan. Dividendson these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. There was no simi

 2019,  the  Company  recorded  a  valuation  allowance  of $76  primarily  related  to  foreign  tax  credits  that  we  believe  will  not  be  realized  due  tolimitations
 on  the  Company's  ability  to  claim  the  credits  during  the  carry  forward  period.  The  foreign  tax  credit  carry  forwards  are  set  to  expirebeginning in fiscal 2027.
The
 Company no longer considers fiscal year earnings of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested and hasrecorded
 the estimated incremental foreign withholding (net of available foreign tax credits) on fiscal year earnings and state income taxes payableassuming

des tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timingof
 such deductibility. At the end of 2019  and 2018 ,  these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other thaninterest
 and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment ofcash
 to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income taxrate in future periods is 
$24  and $32  at the end of 2019  and 2018 , respectively. Accrued
 interest  and  penalties  related  to  income  tax  matters  are  classified  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense.  Interest  and  penaltiesrecognized during 
2019  and 2018  and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material. The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdict
ions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in thenext
 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical toestimate the effect,
 if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection withthe
 audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits inthe next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdicti
ons.With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local exami
nation for years before fiscal 2014.Other Taxes
The
 Company  is  undergoing  multiple  examinations  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll,  product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes  in  variousjurisdictions.
 In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Subsequent to the end of 2019, the Company receivedan
 assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded a charge of $123  in  2019, but plans to protest theassessment.
 Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possibleloss
 or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it couldresult in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal q
uarter or year.Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share

Legal Proceedings
The
 Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance withapplicable
 accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where theypresent loss continge
ncies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. TheCompany
 monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnificationarrangements

 Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accrualsfor
 matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish anaccrual,
 but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. Ineach
 case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where noaccrual
 has  been  recorded,  the  possible  loss  or  range  of  loss  (including  any  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrual)  cannot,  in  the  Company's  view,  be
reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factualtheories are not well developed; an

The
 Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan,Korea,
 Australia, Spain, Iceland, France, and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based onmanagement’s
 organization  of  the  operating  segments  for  operational  decisions  and  assessments  of  financial  performance,  which  considersgeographic
 locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note  1.  Inter-segment net sales and expenses havebeen
 eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, incurredon
 behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally comeunder the responsibility of U.S. management.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
 disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) aredesigned
 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,summarized,
 and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure thatinformation
 required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, toallow
 timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from othermembers
 of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 1, 2019  and,  based on theirevaluation, have conclude
d that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing a
nd maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe
 Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  includes  those  policies  andprocedures
 that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositionsof
 our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  withappropriate
 authorizations;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  ordisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financi
al statements.Because of
 its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation ofeffectiven
ess for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the policies or proced
ures may deteriorate.Under 
the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reportingas of 
September 1, 2019 , using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework (2013).As disclosed in
 Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 , during the fourth
 quarter  of  fiscal 2018  we  identified  a  material  weakness  in  internal  control  related  to  ineffective  information  technology  general  controls(ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information techno
logy (IT) systems that support the Company’sfinancial reporting processes.
During 
2019 ,  management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included: (i) creating and filling an IT Compliance Oversightfunction;
 (ii)  developing  a  training  program  addressing  ITGCs  and  policies,  including  educating  control  owners  concerning  the  principles  andrequirements
 of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change-management over IT systems impacting financial reporting;(iii)
 developing  and  maintaining  documentation  underlying  ITGCs  to  promote  knowledge  transfer  upon  personnel  and  function  changes;  (iv)developing
 enhanced risk assessment procedures and controls related to changes in IT systems; (v) implementing an IT management review andtesting plan to monitor

Table of ContentsITGCs
 with  a  specific  focus  on  systems  supporting  our  financial  reporting  processes;  and  (vi)  enhanced  quarterly  reporting  on  the  remediationmeasures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
During
 the fourth  quarter  of 2019 ,  we  completed  our  testing  of  the  operating  effectiveness  of  the  implemented  controls  and  found  them  to  beeffective. As a result we have concluded the material weakn
ess has been remediated as of September 1, 2019 . Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Except
 for the changes in connection with our implementation of the remediation plan discussed above, there have been no other changes in ourinternal
 control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth  quarter  of2019
 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s interna l control over financial reporting./s/    W. C
