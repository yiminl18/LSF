Overview
        Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a worldwide developer and publisher of online, personal computer ("PC"), video game console, handheld, mobile and tablet
games. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company ," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. W e
currently of fer games that operate on the Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") Xbox One ("Xbox One") and Xbox 360 ("Xbox 360"), Nintendo Co. Ltd.
("Nintendo") W ii U ("W ii U") and W ii ("W ii"), and Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. ("Sony") PlayStation 4 ("PS4") and PlayStation 3 ("PS3") console systems
(Xbox One, W ii U, and PS4 are collectively referred to as "next-generation"; Xbox 360, W ii, and PS3 are collectively referred to as "prior -generation"); the PC;
the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Dual Screen and Sony PlayStation V ita handheld game systems; and mobile and tablet devices.
        Activision —Through Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision"), we are a leading international developer and publisher of interactive software products and
content. Activision develops, markets and sells products through retail channels or digital downloads, which are principally based on our internally developed
intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. Activision delivers content to a broad range of gamers, ranging from children to adults, and from core
gamers to mass-market consumers to "value" buyers seeking budget-priced software, in a variety of geographies. Activision continues to focus its ef forts in the
areas we believe have the most opportunity for growth and higher profitability , while reducing investments in areas we believe have less profit potential and
3
Table of Contents
limited growth opportunities. T o that end, investments are focused on proven intellectual properties to develop deep, high-quality content that of fers engaging
online gaming experiences. One of Activision's leading franchises is Call of Duty®, which launched in 2003, and has been the best-selling W estern interactive
franchise since its launch. In 2015, Activision released the latest installment in the franchise, Call of Duty: Black Ops III , which, according to The NPD Group,
GfK Chart-T rack, and Activision Blizzard internal estimates, was the #1 best-selling console game globally in 2015. Activision is currently developing,
distributing, and selling additional digital content for the global community of Call of Duty: Black Ops III  players, along with content for the other Call of Duty
titles, in addition to developing future releases and sequels.
        Another leading franchise for Activision is Skylanders®, which launched in 201 1 with the release of Skylanders Spyr o's Adventur e. Games in the Skylanders
franchise combine the use of physical toys with digital interactive experiences to deliver innovative gameplay to our audience. In September 2015, we released
Skylanders SuperChar gers, which introduced vehicles-to-life—an entirely new way for fans to experience the magic of Skylanders.
        While focusing on proven intellectual properties is one of Activision's priorities, we also continue to make strategic investments in developing new
intellectual properties that we believe have the potential for long-term growth and success. For example, on September 15, 2015, we released The T aken King , the
third and lar gest expansion to Destiny , the game universe created by Bungie under our long-term alliance with them. W e also introduced microtransactions within
Destiny  in October 2015 and expect to release additional content to our global community of Destiny players in 2016.
        Blizzar d—Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leader in online PC gaming, including the subscription-based massively multi-player online role-
playing game ("MMORPG") category in terms of both subscriber base and revenues generated through its W orld of W arcraft® franchise. Blizzard also develops,
markets, and sells role-playing action and strategy games for the PC, console, mobile and tablet platforms, including games in the multiple-award winning
Diablo®, StarCraft®, Hearthstone®: Heroes of W arcraft™ and Heroes of the Storm™ franchises. In addition, Blizzard maintains a proprietary online gaming
service, Battle.net®, which facilitates the creation of user -generated content, digital distribution and online social connectivity across all Blizzard games. Blizzard
distributes its products and generates revenues worldwide through various means, including: subscriptions; sales of prepaid subscription cards; in-game purchases
and services; retail sales of physical "boxed" products; online download sales of PC products; purchases and downloads via third-party console, mobile and tablet
platforms; and licensing of software to third-party or related party companies that distribute Blizzard products.
        Blizzard has released five expansion packs to the epic W orld of W arcraft franchise since 2004, with the most recent release, World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of
Draenor ®, having been released in November 2014, and the next expansion, World of W arcraft: Legion™,  to be released in the summer of 2016. For
Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft , in addition to bringing the game to iOS and Android smartphones in April 2015, three new content releases, Blackr ock
Mountain ™, The Grand T ournament ™, and The League of Explor ers™, were introduced in 2015 and have continued to drive performance.
        Blizzard continues to invest in new opportunities, both by leveraging its internally developed intellectual property , such as the release of Heroes of the Storm
in 2015, as well as developing new intellectual property with the upcoming team-based first person shooter , Overwatch ™, which is expected to be released
commercially in the spring of 2016.
        Other —We also engage in other business opportunities including:
• The Activision Blizzard Media Networks ("Media Networks") business, announced in 2015, which builds on our ef forts in competitive gaming
and the growing eSports industry;
4
Table of Contents
• The Activision Blizzard Studios ("Studios") business, announced in 2015, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based
on the company's extensive library of iconic and globally-recognized intellectual properties; and 
• The Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistical, and
sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.
        Revenues associated with the Call of Duty , World of W arcraft, Skylanders, and Destiny franchises combined accounted for 71%, 72%, and 80% of our
consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively .
The Business Combination and Shar e Repur chase
        Activision, Inc. was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992.
        Activision Blizzard is the result of the 2008 business combination ("Business Combination") by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.),
Sego Mer ger Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision, Inc., V ivendi S.A. ("V ivendi"), VGAC LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of V ivendi, and
Vivendi Games, Inc. ("V ivendi Games"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of VGAC LLC. As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination,
Activision, Inc. was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. and V ivendi became a majority shareholder of Activision Blizzard. Activision Blizzard is a public
company traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "A TVI."
        On October 1 1, 2013, we repurchased approximately 429 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase
Agreement") we entered into with V ivendi and ASAC II LP ("ASAC"), an exempted limited partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands, acting
by its general partner , ASAC II LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired all of the capital stock of Amber Holding
Subsidiary Co., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of V ivendi ("New VH"), which was the direct owner of approximately 429 million shares
of our common stock, for a cash payment of $5.83 billion, or $13.60 per share, before taking into account the benefit to the Company of certain tax attributes of
New VH assumed in the transaction (collectively , the "Purchase T ransaction"). Refer to Note 1 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding the financing of the Purchase T ransaction.
        Immediately following the completion of the Purchase T ransaction, ASAC purchased from V ivendi 172 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to the
Stock Purchase Agreement, for a cash payment of $2.34 billion, or $13.60 per share (the "Private Sale"). Robert A. Kotick, our Chief Executive Of ficer, and
Brian G. Kelly , Chairman of our Board of Directors, are af filiates of ASAC II LLC.
        On May 28, 2014, V ivendi sold approximately 41 million shares, or approximately 50% of its then-current holdings, of our common stock in a registered
public of fering. Vivendi received proceeds of approximately $850 million from that sale; we did not receive any proceeds.
        As of December 31, 2015, we had 734 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. At that date, (i) Vivendi held 41 million shares, or
approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (ii) ASAC held 172 million shares, or approximately 23% of the outstanding shares of our
common stock, and (iii) our other stockholders held approximately 71% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.
5
Table of Contents
        On January 13, 2016, V ivendi sold all of their remaining shares of our common stock. W e did not receive any proceeds from the sale.
The King Acquisition
        On November 2, 2015, we and King Digital Entertainment plc, a leading interactive entertainment company for the mobile world incorporated under the
laws of Ireland ("King"), entered into a T ransaction Agreement (the "T ransaction Agreement") under the terms of which we would acquire King (the "King
Acquisition") and King would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company . On February 23, 2016 we completed the King Acquisition under the terms of
the T ransaction Agreement. W e transferred $5.9 billion in consideration to the existing King shareholders and share-based award holders.
        The Company made this acquisition because it believes that the addition of King's highly-complementary mobile business will position the Company as a
global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console and PC platforms, and positions the company for future growth. The combined company has a
world-class interactive entertainment portfolio of top-performing franchises.
        As the closing of the King Acquisition occurred subsequent to December 31, 2015, our financial results as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, do
not contain the results of King.
Our Strategy
        Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment software,
online content and services that deliver year -round, highly satisfying and engaging entertainment experiences.
        Continue to Impr ove Pr ofitability .    We continually strive to manage risk and increase our operating ef ficiency with the goal of increased profitability . We
believe the key factors af fecting our future profitability will be the success of proven franchises and genres, cost discipline, and our ability to benefit from the
continued growth of online and digital revenue opportunities.
        Cr eate Shar eholder V alue.     We continue to focus on enhancing shareholder returns through profitable operations and strong cash flows. As a result, we
expect to continue to achieve long-term growth and to deliver returns to our shareholders.
        Gr ow Thr ough Continued Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.     We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our resources, the geographic reach of
our products, and our intellectual properties library through acquisitions, strategic relationships, and key licensing transactions. W e will also continue to invest in,
and build on, existing alliances and relationships. In addition, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our proven development expertise through the
acquisition of, or investment in, selected experienced software development firms.
        Focus on Delivery of Digital Content and Online Services.     We continue to shift towards digital delivery of content and to establish and develop direct and
long-term relationships with our gamers. W e will also continue to support, maintain and enhance the online communities for our games and franchises. W e
believe that focusing our ef forts on online product innovations, such as additional online content, services and social connectivity , provides lasting value to our
global communities of players. In addition, we continue to expand into new business models for the digital delivery of content, including of fering free-to-play
games with monetization through in-game microtransactions along with increased in-game microtransactions within our purchased software products. W e are also
focused on increasing our presence on new digital platforms, such as mobile and tablet devices.

Table of Contents
        Extend the Reach of our Existing Franchises.     We are focused on identifying and investing in business opportunities that extend our existing franchises into
adjacent entertainment verticals, deepen audience engagement by celebrating our players, deliver high production values to our communities, and provide greater
opportunities for player investment. This includes investments in our Media Networks and Studios businesses. Our Media Networks business acquired Major
League Gaming Inc. ("MLG") which provides an immediate expansion of our reach across the rapidly-growing eSports ecosystem by adding proven live
streaming capabilities and technologies. Competitive gaming and the spectator opportunities connected to or ganized gaming competitions could provide
opportunities for shareholders and great rewards and recognition for our hundreds of millions of players. Our Studios business is focused on producing an
animated Skylanders television series which we expect to release in the fall of 2016 and has begun work on developing a robust cinematic universe based on the
Call of Duty franchise.
Competition
        We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with providers of
different forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television, social networking, online casual entertainment, music and other consumer products.
        The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced.
Our competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to lar ge corporations who may have greater financial, marketing, and product
development resources than we have. Due to their dif ferent focuses and allocation of resources, certain of our competitors may spend more money and time on
developing and testing products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay higher fees for licenses, and pay
more to third-party software developers than we do. In addition, competitors with lar ge product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with
retailers, distributors, and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to such competitor's most popular
titles. W e believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality , and playability; brand name
recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price; marketing
support; and quality of customer service.
        We compete primarily with other publishers of PC, online, mobile, and video game console interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party
software competitors, integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony , compete directly with us in the
development of software titles for their respective platforms. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing,
online games for use by consumers over the Internet. Further , we compete with publishers of mobile games, who may be narrowly focused on publishing games
for mobile and tablet devices. Lastly , with our Skylanders franchise and its toys and accessories, we compete indirectly with companies who sell toys to our tar get
consumers for this franchise. W e expect new competitors to continue to emer ge in the "toys to life", MMORPG, free-to-play and other microtransaction-based
game categories. Notably in 2015, the toys to life category became more competitive with a new entrant competing directly with us and other incumbents.
Employees
        At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 7,300 total full-time and part-time employees. At December 31, 2015, approximately 1 10 of our full-time
employees were subject to fixed-term employment agreements with us. These agreements generally commit the employee and the Company to employment terms
of between one and five years from the commencement of the agreement. Most
7
Table of Contents
of our employees who are subject to these agreements are executive of ficers or key members of the product development, sales, or marketing divisions. These
individuals perform services for us as executives, directors, producers, associate producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales directors, or marketing
product managers. In our experience, entering into employment agreements with these employees reduces our turnover during the development, production and
distribution phases of our entertainment software products and allows us to plan more ef fectively for future development and marketing activities. Some
employees outside of the United States ("U.S.") are also party to employment agreements that do not specify a fixed term.
        The majority of our employees in France, Germany , Spain, and Italy are subject to collective agreements as a part of normal business practices in those
countries. In addition, certain employees in those countries are subject to collective bar gaining agreements. T o date, we have not experienced any labor -related
work stoppages.
Intellectual Pr operty
        Like other entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property . Some of
this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology , and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our
games and to make them run properly . Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear and interact
with when they are playing our games.
        We develop some of our products from wholly-owned intellectual properties that we create within our own studios. W e also acquire the rights to include
proprietary intellectual property in our products through acquisitions. In addition, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements. These
agreements typically limit our use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods. In addition, our products that play on game consoles, as well as
handheld, mobile and tablet platforms, include technology that is owned by the console or wireless device manufacturer , and is licensed non-exclusively to us for
use. W e also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business is dependent
on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.
        We actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property . We typically own the copyright to the software code in our
products. Moreover , we own or license the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed. W e register copyrights, trademarks and patents
in the U.S. and in other countries as appropriate.
        We often distribute our PC products using copy protection technology or other technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of
unauthorized copies of our products. In addition, console manufacturers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their
consoles in an ef fort to prevent the use of unlicensed products. W e are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect against unauthorized
copying and piracy , including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies, and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education
programs and legislative activity around the world.
Significant Customers
        We had two customers, Sony and Microsoft, who accounted for 12% and 10% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015,
respectively . We did not have any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 or
2013. W e had three customers, Sony , Microsoft, and W al-Mart, who accounted for 18%, 13%,
8
Table of Contents
and 1 1% of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2015, respectively , and 13%, 17%, and 1 1% of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2014,
respectively .
Reportable Segments
        We have two reportable operating segments: (i) Activision Publishing, Inc. and its subsidiaries—publishing interactive entertainment software products and
downloadable content, and (ii) Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries—publishing real-time strategy games, role-playing games and online
subscription-based games in the MMORPG category . Previously , we reported "Distribution" as a reportable segment. In the current period, this was no longer
deemed a separate reportable segment and is included in "Other" along with our recently announced Media Networks and Studios businesses.
        See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for certain additional information regarding operating segments and geographical
performance.
Activision—Business Overview
Strategy
        Cr eate, Acquir e and Maintain Str ong Franchises.     Activision focuses on development and publishing activities, principally for products and content that
are, or have the potential to become, franchises with sustainable mass consumer appeal and recognition and year -round engagement. It is our experience that these
products and content can then serve as the basis for sequels, prequels and related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time.
We believe that the publishing and distribution of products and content based on proven franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high
unit volume sales and operating profits. Our successful intellectual properties include the Call of Duty and Skylanders franchises, and we intend to continue
development of owned franchises in the future. W e also have an exclusive long-term alliance with Bungie, the developer of the successful Destiny franchise.
        Execute Disciplined Pr oduct Selection and Development Pr ocesses.     The success of our publishing business depends, in significant part, on our ability to
develop high-quality content that will generate significant demand among our global communities. Our publishing units have implemented a formal control
process for the selection, development, production and quality assurance of that content. W e apply this process, which we refer to as the "Greenlight Process," to
all of our products and content, whether they are externally or internally developed. The Greenlight Process includes regular in-depth reviews at important stages
of development by a team that includes many of our highest-ranking operating managers and enables coordination among our sales, marketing and development
staff at each step in the process.
        We develop our content and products using a combination of our internal development resources and external development resources acting under contract
with us. W e typically select our external developers based on their track records and expertise in producing products in the same category . One developer will
often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the original game. W e believe that selecting and using development resources in
this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources, which we believe enhances the quality of our
products and accelerates the timing of releases.
        Focused Content and Pr oduct Offerings, Diversity in Platforms and Geographies.     We believe Activision has aligned its product of ferings and cost
structure to position the business for long-term growth. Through our online-enabled products and content, we believe we are best positioned to take advantage of
retail and digital distribution channels that allow us to deliver content to a broad range of gamers, ranging from children to adults and from core gamers to mass-
market consumers and to "value" buyers seeking budget-priced software, in a variety of geographies. Presently , the majority of products that we develop, publish
and distribute operate on the PS4, PS3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, W ii U, and W ii console systems, and the PC.

        In recent years, Activision has been best known for its success in the first-person action category from its internally-developed intellectual property , Call of
Duty . Our latest release, Call of Duty: Black Ops III , was released on November 6, 2015, and was the #1 best-selling console game globally for 2015, according
to The NPD Group, GfK Chart-T rack, and our internal estimates.
        On September 20, 2015, Activision launched Skylanders SuperChar gers, the fifth title in our Skylanders franchise, an internally-developed intellectual
property that combines the use of physical toys with video games to deliver innovative gameplay experiences to our audience. Specifically , the games in the
Skylanders franchise involve "smart toys" consisting of action figures and accessories and an electronic "portal" which, when used with a figure or accessory ,
allows a player to store and access information about his or her performance in the game. W e sell the toys and accessories both bundled with the software for the
titles and on a stand-alone basis. Skylanders SuperChar gers continues with the innovative "toys to life" concept with the new "vehicles to life" concept which
includes online multiplayer and racing gameplay .
        On September 9, 2014, Activision released Bungie's Destiny , an online universe of first-person action gameplay which we have called the world's first
"shared-world shooter". On May 19, 2015, Activision released House of W olves , the second expansion to Destiny , and on September 15, 2015, Activision released
The T aken King , the third and lar gest expansion to Destiny .
        Activision also develops products spanning other genres, including first-person action, action/adventure, role-playing, simulation and strategy .
Product Development and Support
        Activision develops and produces titles using a model in which a core group of creative, production and technical professionals, in coordination with our
marketing, finance and other departments, has responsibility for the entire development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of
internal and external resources. This team assembles the necessary creative elements to complete and release content through, where appropriate, outside
programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians and songwriters, sound ef fects and special ef fects experts, and sound and video studios.
        Activision believes that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.
        In addition, Activision periodically engages independent third-party developers to create content on Activision's behalf. W e may either own or have rights to
commercially exploit these products. In other circumstances, a third-party developer may retain ownership of the intellectual property and/or technology included
in the product, or reserve certain exploitation rights with respect thereto. Activision typically selects these independent third-party developers based on their
expertise in developing products in a specific category for specific platforms. Each of our third-party developers is under contract with us, either for a single or
multiple titles. From time to time, Activision also acquires the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently
created by third-party developers. In such cases, the agreements with these developers typically provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for
a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and territories. In either case, Activision often has the ability to publish and/or distribute sequels,
conversions, enhancements, and add-ons to the product initially being produced by the independent developer and Activision frequently has the right to engage
the services of the original developer with regard to further product development.
        In consideration for the services that external third-party developers provide, the developers can sometimes receive a royalty , which is generally based on net
sales or operating income of the developed products. T ypically , developers also receive an advance, which Activision recoups from the royalties
10
Table of Contents
otherwise payable to the developers. The advance generally is paid in "milestone" stages. The payment at each stage is tied to the completion and delivery of a
detailed performance milestone. W orking with external developers allows us to reduce our fixed development costs, share development risks with the third-party
developers, take advantage of the third-party developers' expertise in connection with certain categories of products or certain platforms, and gain access to
proprietary development technologies.
        In April 2010, Activision entered into a long-term exclusive relationship with Bungie, the developer of game franchises including Halo, Myth  and Marathon,
to bring Bungie's next big action game universe, Destiny , to market. During the term of the agreement, Activision has exclusive, worldwide rights to publish and
distribute all future Bungie games based on Destiny  on multiple platforms.
        Activision provides various forms of product support to both our internally and externally developed content. Activision's central technology and
development teams review , assess and provide support to products throughout their milestone development phases. Quality assurance personnel are also involved
throughout the development and production of published content. Activision subjects all such content to extensive testing before release to ensure compatibility
with all appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. T o support our content,
Activision generally provides 24-hour online access to customer service representatives, as well as live telephone operators who answer the help lines during
regular business hours.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
        Many of our products contain software that enables customers to "electronically register" with us online, which allows us to connect with our gamers
directly . This provides a significant marketing tool for direct advertising with our customers and customization of in-game advertising based on customer
preferences and trends. Additionally , Activision's marketing ef forts include activities on the Internet (including on Facebook, T witter , YouTube and other online
social networks and websites), public relations, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point
of purchase displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software
distributed through the Internet or the digital online services provided by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony . From time to time, we also receive marketing support
from hardware manufacturers, mass appeal consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional ef forts.
        We believe that our strong proven franchises generate a loyal and devoted customer base that continues to engage with our franchises and purchase
additional content as a result of their dedication to a franchise and satisfaction from previous content purchases. W e therefore market this additional content,
including sequels, expansion packs and downloadable content, toward the established customer base as well as to broader audiences. In addition, we believe that
we derive benefits for our licensed properties from the marketing and promotional activities undertaken by the underlying intellectual property owners, in
addition to our own marketing ef forts.
        North American Retail Sales and Distribution.     Our products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail outlets in North America. Our North
American retail customers include, among others, Amazon, Best Buy , GameStop, T arget, T oys "R" Us and W al-Mart.
        In the U.S. and Canada, our products are primarily sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and
game specialty stores, as well to consumers through direct digital purchases. W e believe that a direct relationship with retailers results in more ef fective inventory
management, merchandising and communications than would be possible through indirect relationships. W e have implemented electronic data interchange
linkages with many of our
11
Table of Contents
retailers to facilitate the placing and shipping of orders. W e also sell our products to a limited number of distributors.
        International Retail Sales and Distribution.     Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. W e conduct our international publishing activities through of fices in Australia,
China, France, Germany , Ireland, Italy , the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). W e often seek to maximize our worldwide revenues
and profits by releasing high-quality foreign language releases concurrently with English language releases and by continuing to expand the number of direct
selling relationships we maintain with key retailers in major territories.
        Digital Distribution.     Online and digital distribution channels are continuing to grow and comprise a significant part of our business. Most of our products
and content are sold in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their PC, console system,
or handheld, mobile or tablet device. W e partner with digital distributors to utilize this growing method of distribution. W e also make downloadable content and
in-game microtransactions available to our customers to enhance their gaming experience through the digital online services mainly provided by Microsoft and
Sony . In addition, we are exploring new business models involving digital distribution, including of fering free-to-play games with monetization through in-game
microtransactions.
Manufacturing
        Activision prepares a set of master program copies, documentation and packaging materials for our products for each hardware platform on which the
product will be released. W ith respect to products for use on the Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony systems, our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing,
warehousing, assembly and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors and Activision-owned distribution facilities.
        To maintain protection over their hardware technologies, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of
finished products and license their hardware technologies to us. W e deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator , which then
manufactures finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label. At the time our product unit orders are filled by the manufacturer , we
become responsible for the costs of manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the units do not ultimately sell.

Item 1A.    RISK F ACT ORS 
        We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause our actual results to dif fer materially from those stated in forward -looking statements contained
in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further , the risks described below are not
the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse ef fect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, profitability , cash
flows, liquidity or stock price.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits from the King Acquisition.
        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition. The acquisition and integration of the King business exposes us to a number of legal, financial,
accounting, tax, managerial, operational and other risks and challenges. Any of these risks or challenges could adversely af fect our financial position, profitability
and stock price. Such risks and challenges include, but are not limited to, the following:
• King could underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it. 
• King could cause our financial results to dif fer from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the longer -
term. 
• The tax consequences of the King Acquisition, or the tax treatment of King's operations going forward, could give rise to incremental tax
liabilities that are dif ficult to predict. 
• Earnings char ges relating to the King Acquisition could adversely impact our operating results in any given period, and the impact may be
substantially dif ferent from period to period. 
• The integration of King could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are
unable to ef fectively handle. 
• We could experience dif ficulty in integrating King's personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees. 
• By acquiring King we may have assumed unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies, and the liabilities that we assumed as a result of the
King Acquisition may prove greater than anticipated. The liabilities we assumed include those with respect to King's ongoing legal proceedings,
including purported securities class action lawsuits relating to King's initial public of fering in March 2014, and those with respect to King's tax
liabilities in various jurisdictions. Any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely af fect our financial position or
cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.
15
Table of Contents
• As a result of the King Acquisition, we have recorded significant goodwill and other definite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are
not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur char ges relating to the impairment of these assets.
We engage in strategic transactions and may encounter dif ficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the
transactions.
        As part of our business strategy , from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with complementary
businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (A) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the dif ficulty in integrating the
acquired business and operations in an ef ficient and ef fective manner , (ii) any liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition, and (iii) the potential loss of key
employees of the acquired businesses, and, (B) in the case of an investment, alliance or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate with our partner , (ii) our partner
having economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and (iii) the potential that our partner may be unable to meet its economic or
other obligations, which would require us to fulfill those obligations alone. If any such transaction involves an entity outside of the United States, it may also
subject us to the risks and uncertainties of international trade, including the risk that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our
employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents in ways that violate anti-bribery laws. Further , any such transaction may involve the risk
that our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated and that
any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings
or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.
We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.
        A significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular franchises and these products
are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, revenues associated with the Call of Duty , World of W arcraft, Skylanders,
and Destiny franchises accounted for approximately 71% of our net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2015. Similarly ,
King's top two franchises—Candy Crush and Farm Heroes—accounted for a substantial majority of King's revenues in 2015. W e expect that a relatively limited
number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited
number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business.
If we do not consistently deliver high -quality content, or if consumers prefer competing products, our sales could suf fer.
        While many new products are regularly introduced in our industry , only a relatively small number of games account for a significant portion of revenues, and
an even greater portion of profit. It is dif ficult to produce high-quality content and to predict, prior to production and distribution, what games will be well-
received, even if they are well-reviewed and of high-quality . Competitors often develop content that imitates or competes with our best-selling games, and take
sales away from them or reduce our ability to char ge the same prices we have historically char ged for our products. Products published by our competitors may
take a lar ger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause our product sales to fall below expectations. Consumers may lose interest in a genre
of games we produce. If we do not continue to develop consistently high- quality and well-received games, or if our competitors develop more successful
products or of fer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues, mar gins and profitability could decline. The increased importance of downloadable content
to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly-received games
16
Table of Contents
typically generates lower -than-expected sales. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other
games. Further , a failure by us to develop a high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well-received, could harm our reputation
and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well-received.
We have taken on significant debt, which could adversely af fect our business.
        Prior to the Purchase T ransaction, the Company maintained extremely low levels of debt. In connection with the Purchase T ransaction, we entered into a
credit agreement for a $2.5 billion secured term loan facility and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility . The credit agreement was amended in
connection with the King Acquisition (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") to, among other things, provide for an incremental $2.3 billion
secured term loan facility . In addition, in connection with the Purchase T ransaction, we issued, at par , $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due
September 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 (the "2023 Notes" and, together with the 2021
Notes, the "Notes"). As of the date hereof, the Company has approximately $5.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding. The increased debt burden could have
important consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for , or
reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy , working capital, capital
expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings
that are at variable rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain
additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other
purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly
leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are held outside the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without
under going the costs of repatriating those funds.
The agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may af fect our ability to operate our business.
        Agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Agreement, impose operating and financial restrictions
on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In addition, the indenture and credit agreement limit or
prohibit our ability to, among other things:
• incur additional debt and guarantees; 
• pay distributions or dividends and repurchase stock; 
• make other restricted payments, including without limitation, certain restricted investments; 
• create liens; 
• enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; 
• engage in transactions with af filiates; and  
• enter into mer gers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets.
        In addition, we are required to maintain a maximum total net debt ratio calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under the Credit Agreement.
17
Table of Contents
        These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by , among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of
financing, mer ger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.
        Further , various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could af fect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the
covenants in our financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such a
default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these
circumstances, we might not have suf ficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the indenture governing the
Notes or the Credit Agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might
significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. W e cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any
reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
We may not be able to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing under that facility .
        We view our revolving credit facility as a source of available liquidity . This facility contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which
we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. W e have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility to date, but if we wish to do so, there can be no
assurance that we will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations at such time.
We may be unable to ef fectively manage the growth in scope and complexity of our business.
        We have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through the development of our Media Networks and Studios
businesses. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business. The growth of our business could create significant challenges
for our management, operational, and financial resources, and could increase existing strain on, and divert focus from, our core businesses.
        In addition, the growth of these new businesses may require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources.
If not managed ef fectively , this growth could result in the over -extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems, information technology
systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may
cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our business.
Our financial performance is partly driven by our success in the subscription -based massively multiplayer online role -playing game category , and we may be
negatively impacted if consumer preferences trend away from subscription-based games.
        A portion of our revenues is generated by subscription fees paid by consumers who play World of W arcraft . If consumer demand for World of W arcraft
declines or if new technologies, play patterns or genres are developed that replace MMORPGs or consumer preferences trend away from subscription-based
MMORPGs in favor of free-to-play MMORPGs, it may negatively impact our business.
Sales of titles in certain of our franchises may be af fected by the availability of toys and hardware peripherals, increasing our exposure to imbalances
between projected and actual demand.
        Titles in our Skylanders franchise involve "smart toys," consisting of action figures and accessories, along with an electronic "portal," which, when used with
a figure or accessory , allows a player to store and access information about his or her performance in the game. Similarly , titles in our Guitar Hero
18
Table of Contents
franchise use guitar -shaped controllers and other hardware peripherals. W e sell the action figures and accessories for Skylanders both bundled with the software
for the title and on a stand-alone basis. Consumers may not want to buy the related software if they cannot also buy the "smart toys" or accessories. If we
underestimate demand or otherwise are unable to produce suf ficient quantities of toys or accessories of an acceptable quality or allocate too few toys or
accessories to geographic markets where demand exceeds supply , we will forego revenues. This may also create greater opportunities for competitors to develop
competitive product of ferings. In addition, if we overestimate demand and make too many toys or accessories, or allocate too many toys or accessories to
geographic markets where there is insuf ficient demand, we may incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units as well as for unsold game software.
Similarly , if we overestimate demand for our Guitar Hero games, we may incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold games. In any case, unsound
hardware manufacturing or allocation decisions may negatively impact our business.
The "smart toys," accessories and hardware peripherals related to certain of our franchises, expose us to hardware manufacturing and shipping risks,
including availability of suf ficient third -party manufacturing capacity and increases in manufacturing and shipping costs.
        The majority of the manufacturers of the "smart toys" involved in our Skylanders franchise and the hardware peripherals used in our Guitar Hero games are
third parties located in China. Anything that impacts our ability to import these products or the ability of those manufacturers to produce or otherwise supply us
with hardware meeting our quality and safety standards or increases the manufacturers' costs of production may adversely impact our ability to supply that
hardware to the market and the prices we must pay for that hardware. Examples of such impacts include: the utilization of any such manufacturer's capacity by
another company , changes in safety , environmental or other regulations applicable to the hardware and the manufacturing thereof, natural or manmade disasters
that disrupt manufacturing, transportation or communications, labor shortages, civil unrest or issues generally negatively impacting international companies
operating in China, increases in the price of petroleum or other raw materials, increases in fuel prices and other shipping costs, and increases in local labor costs
in China. Moreover , the failure of those manufacturers to consistently deliver Skylanders action figures or portals and/or Guitar Hero hardware peripherals
meeting the quality and safety standards we require could negatively impact our business.
The increasing importance of free-to-play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including the dependence on a relatively small
number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any game
        As a result of the King Acquisition, we will be more dependent on our ability to develop, enhance and monetize free-to-play games. These games are
available for download to consumers for free, and only generate revenue if consumers use in-game virtual currency to purchase, for example, entertainment time,
game boosters, and access to additional content. A relatively small portion of our player network accounts for a lar ge portion of our revenues from our free-to-
play games, such as those in our Candy Crush franchise. If we are unable to continue to of fer games that encourage these consumers to purchase our virtual
currency and subsequently use it to buy our virtual items, if we fail to of fer monetization features that appeal to these consumers, if these consumers do not
continue to play our games or to purchase virtual items at the same rate, or if we cannot encourage significant additional consumers to purchase virtual items in
our games, it could negatively impact our business. Also, if our platform providers make it more dif ficult or expensive for players to purchase, or we otherwise
fail to sell, our virtual currency , our business may be materially and adversely af fected.
Transitions in console platforms could adversely af fect the market for interactive entertainment software.
        When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment
software products for prior console platforms in
19
Table of Contents
anticipation of purchasing a new platform and products for that platform. During these periods, sales of the game console entertainment software products we
publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance. Platform transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable
content, amplifying the impact on our revenues. This decline may not be of fset by increased sales of products for the new console platforms. Conversely , actions
we take to curtail the reduction of purchases of products for prior console platforms during the transition may harm sales of products we publish for prior -
generation platforms. In addition, as console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices
may put downward pressure on software prices. During platform transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new
titles for prior -generation video game platforms, which may not sell at premium prices, and also in developing products for next -generation platforms, which
may not generate immediate or near term revenues. As a result, our business and operating results may be more volatile and dif ficult to predict during platform
transitions than during other times.
Our business is highly dependent on the success, timely release and availability of new video game platforms and on the continued availability of, and support
for, existing video game platforms, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms.
        We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PS4
and PS3, Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox 360, and Nintendo's W ii U and W ii. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted for 51% of our consolidated
net revenues in 2015. The success of our business is driven in lar ge part by our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace,
our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms, the availability of an adequate supply of these video game platforms and the
continued support for these platforms by their manufacturers. W e must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of
the anticipated introduction of a new platform.
We must make significant expenditures to develop products for new platforms that may not be successful.
        We must make substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the platform and may be
required to realign our product portfolio and development ef forts in response to market changes. Furthermore, development costs for new console platforms are
greater than those costs for the then-current console platforms. If increased costs are not of fset by higher revenues and other cost ef ficiencies, our business could
be negatively impacted. If the platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant market penetration, we
may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.
Platform licensors frequently control the manufacturing of, and have broad approval rights over , interactive entertainment products.
        Generally , when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms of fered by Sony , Microsoft, or Nintendo, the products are
manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator . The agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such
as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they char ge for the manufacturing of products,
which allow them substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. In addition, because each of the
manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give
priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of insuf ficient manufacturing capacity . Accordingly , Sony , Microsoft, or Nintendo could cause
unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution costs, any of which
could negatively impact our business.
20
Table of Contents
        In addition, platform licensors control our ability to provide online game capabilities for console platform products and, in lar ge part, establish the financial
terms and/or pricing on which these products and services are of fered to consumers. Currently , Sony provides online capabilities for the PS4 and PS3, Microsoft
provides online capabilities for the Xbox One and Xbox 360, and Nintendo provides online capabilities for the W ii U and W ii. In each case, compatibility code
and/or the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in its console products. The failure or refusal of licensors to approve our
products could negatively impact our business.
We must negotiate with platform licensors to agree upon the royalty rates and other fees that must be paid to publish games for their platforms or distribute
content on their networks, and therefore they can have significant influence on our costs.
        We pay a licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform. The platform license
agreements we enter into with those manufacturers specify the fee and/or price that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly , the
platform licensors control the retail pricing for games and additional content purchased over their networks. The control that platform licensors have over the fee
structures and/or pricing for their platforms and online networks could impact the volume of purchases of our products made over their network and our
profitability . It is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our existing licenses and/or will decline to distribute our digital content on their networks.
Any increase in fee structures and/or pricing, or nonrenewal of licenses, could have a negative impact on our business, particularly for Activision, as the
publishing of products for console systems is the lar gest portion of Activision's business.
        Outside of fee arrangements, our agreement with any manufacturer typically gives it significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products
and services that we develop for that manufacturer's game platform. If the manufacturer establishes terms that restrict our of ferings on its platform, or
significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are of fered to our customers, we may be unable to distribute our products or be forced
to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms.
We rely on third-party platforms to distribute our free-to-play games and collect payments. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such
platform providers, if their terms and conditions, methods of distribution, payment practices or pricing changed to our detriment, or if we violate, or if a
platform provider believes that we have violated, the terms and conditions of its platform, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Following the King Acquisition, we expect to derive significant revenues from the distribution of our free-to-play games on third-party platforms such as the
Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, and most of the virtual currency we sell is purchased using the payments processing systems of these
platform providers. These platforms also serve as significant online distribution platforms for our games. W e are subject to their standard terms and conditions for
application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on their platforms. If we violate, or if a platform
provider believes that we have violated, its terms and conditions, the particular platform provider may discontinue or limit our access to that platform, which
would harm our business. Our business would also be harmed if: their platforms decline in popularity; they modify their current discovery mechanisms,
communication channels available to developers, respective terms of service or other policies, including fees; they are required to change how they label free-to-
play games or take payment for in-app purchases, or change how the personal information of consumers is made available to developers; or they develop their
own competitive of ferings.

If we do not continue to attract and retain skilled personnel, we will be unable to ef fectively conduct our business.
        One of our most essential assets is our employees and, as such, our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify , hire, retain and utilize
the abilities of qualified personnel, particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high-quality , well- received content upon which
our business is substantially dependent. The software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors
for employees with technical, marketing, sales, engineering, product development, creative and/or management skills. W e may have dif ficulties in attracting and
retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the
services of key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.
Our reputation with consumers is critical to our success. Negative consumer perceptions about our brands, games, services and/or business practices may
damage our business and any costs incurred in addressing consumer concerns may increase our operating expenses.
        Individual consumers form our ultimate customer base, and consumer expectations regarding the quality , performance and integrity of our products and
services are high. Consumers may be critical of our brands, games, services and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons. These negative consumer
reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage ef fectively . Actions we take to address consumer concerns may be costly and, in any case, may
not be successful. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and
consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be damaging to our reputation. Any of these may have a negative impact on our
business.
We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and
services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.
        We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we of fer. Some open source software licenses require users who
distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works
of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that
such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. W ere it determined that
our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-
engineer our games, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert
resources away from our game development ef forts, any of which could harm our business.
If our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may have a negative impact on our business.
        If our games and services do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suf fer. The
risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because they involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we
may not be able to successfully satisfy . Our games with online features are also frequently updated, increasing the risk that a game may contain significant
"bugs." Further , these games are reliant on third-party servers and platform providers, increasing the risk that a particular game may be unavailable when
consumers attempt to access it or that navigation through a game may be slower than consumers expect. If any of these issues occur , consumers may stop playing
the game
22
Table of Contents
and may be less likely to return to the game as often in the future. If our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may negatively impact our
business.
The future success of our business depends on our ability to release popular products in a timely manner .
        The life of any given console, handheld or mobile game product is relatively short and generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few
months after the product's introduction, followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a
high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or
more new products could have a material adverse ef fect on our revenues and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially dif ferent from
expectations. It is therefore important for us to continue to develop many high-quality new products that are popularly received and to release those products in a
timely manner , as well as to continue to extend the life of existing games by adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with the
game. If we are unable to continue to do so, it may negatively impact our business.
If we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our products, our business could suf fer materially .
        If we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our console or PC titles or the associated downloadable content, whether due to competitive pressure,
because retailers elect to price these products at a lower price or otherwise, it could have a negative impact on our business. Further , we make provisions for retail
inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to lower our prices below those levels, it could
similarly have a negative impact on our business.
If we fail to successfully manage our new product development, or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with that development, it may negatively impact
our business.
        Our business models are evolving and we believe that our growth will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully develop and sell new types of
products, and to otherwise expand the methods by which we reach our consumers, including via digital distribution. Developing new products and distribution
channels requires substantial up- front expenditures. Further , forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and
volatile. If such products or distribution channels do not achieve expected acceptance or generate suf ficient revenues upon introduction, whether because of
competition or otherwise, we may not recover the cost of our investments in developing and marketing those products and distribution channels, or recover the
opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels. In addition, expanding our business models
will add complexity to our business and require us to ef fectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and dif ferent
requirements of any new areas in which we operate, which we may not be able to do, for lack of institutional expertise or otherwise.
Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our new resources among, emerging technologies
and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry . We must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emer ging technologies,
delivery platforms and business models in order to stay competitive. When we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a
new platform, operating system or media format, we often are required to make a substantial investment prior to the introduction of the product. If we invest in
the development of interactive entertainment products incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does
23
Table of Contents
not achieve significant commercial success, our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs.
Further , our competitors may adapt to an emer ging technology or business model more quickly or ef fectively than we do, creating products that are
technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both. If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a
new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue a new business model, that achieves significant commercial success, it may have adverse
consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology , platform or business model, as the case may
be, and may be more dif ficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business
model. For example, digital content delivery is increasingly important in our industry , requiring us to develop or acquire the expertise in such delivery method
needed to remain competitive. Any failure to successfully adapt to, and appropriately allocate resources among, emer ging technologies could negatively impact
our business.
The increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition.
        The proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery , as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The increased importance
of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game,
particularly a new game for mobile platforms, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution
and is played on a game console. Shifting to digital delivery of our products also requires us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative
marketing strategies, which we may not do successfully . If any of this occurs, it could have a material adverse ef fect on our business. In addition, a continuing
shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers and distributors, giving rise to the same material adverse ef fects.
The increasing prevalence of free -to-play games exposes us to risks from that business model.
        We expect that the portion of the total revenues of the interactive entertainment industry , and of our revenues, generated by free-to-play entertainment
products, which are monetized through in-game microtransactions rather than an up-front fee, will continue to increase, including as a result of the King
Acquisition. W e may invest in the development of free-to-play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which
case our revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Even if our free-to-play games are
initially well-received, we may not be able to generate or sustain consumer engagement suf ficient to generate significant revenues, if any , through in-game
microtransactions. In addition, a continuing shift to free-to-play games could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers and distributors.
Furthermore, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing free-to-play games, we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing
competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games.
If we are unable to successfully develop or market owned intellectual property , we may publish fewer successful games and our revenues may decline.
        Some of our products are based on intellectual property that we have developed internally or acquired from third parties. Consumers have historically
preferred content which is part of an established franchise to content based on new intellectual property . If a new intellectual property does not gain consumer
acceptance, whether because we are unable to successfully create consumer appeal and brand recognition or for other reasons, our business could be negatively
impacted. Further , if the popularity of our owned intellectual property declines, we may have to write of f the unrecovered
24
Table of Contents
portion of the underlying intellectual property assets, and revenues and operating income from these intellectual properties may decline quickly , either of which
could negatively impact our business.
Competition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.
        Within the interactive entertainment industry , we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software, both within the United States and,
increasingly , in international jurisdictions. Our competitors include very lar ge corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product
development resources than we have. For example, integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as Sony , Microsoft and Nintendo,
compete directly with us in the development of content for their respective platforms. A relatively small number of franchises account for a significant portion of
revenues, and an even greater portion of profit, in the interactive entertainment industry , and the availability of significant financial resources is a major
competitive factor in the production of high-quality products and in the marketing of products that are ultimately well-received. Our lar ger competitors may be
able to leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources to finance lar ger budgets for development and marketing and make higher of fers
to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful
video game products than we do. In addition, competitors with lar ge product lines and popular games typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors
and other customers, who may be willing to promote products with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors' more popular games.
        Increased consumer acceptance and availability of interactive entertainment developed for use by consumers on handheld, mobile and tablet devices or
social networking sites or other online games, consumer acceptance and availability of technology which allows users to play games on televisions without
consoles, or technological advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in sales of our platform-based software.
        Furthermore, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing mobile or online free-to-play or other casual games, we expect new competitors to
enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications. W e compete, or will compete,
with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch casual games and other content using relatively limited resources and
with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. Competition for the attention of consumers on mobile devices is intense, as the number of applications on mobile
devices has been increasing dramatically . This increased competition could negatively impact our business.
        Additionally , we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example, the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online
services such as social networking sites by consumers may pose a competitive threat if consumers and potential consumers spend less of their available time using
interactive entertainment software and more of their available time using the Internet, including those online services. Further , it is dif ficult to predict and prepare
for rapid changes in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for dif ferent forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Failure to
adequately identify and adapt to the competitive pressures described herein could negatively impact our business.
The development of high -quality products requires substantial up-front expenditures, and we may not be able to recover those costs for our future products.
        Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and dif ficult to predict, and even the most successful content remains popular for only limited periods
of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or
25
Table of Contents
enhancements to existing products. The amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead
time involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict
consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate suf ficient revenues upon introduction, we
may not be able to recover the substantial development and marketing costs associated with those products.
We may overestimate demand for a product, incurring unrecoverable manufacturing costs.
        We pay a licensing fee to the console hardware manufacturer for each physical copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform,
regardless of whether that product is sold. If we overestimate demand and make too many physical "boxed" copies of any title, we will incur unrecoverable
manufacturing costs for unsold units.
We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.
        The interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year -end holiday buying season
in the fourth quarter of the year . As a result, our sales have historically been highest during the second half of the year , particularly for our Activision segment.
Receivables and credit risk are likewise higher during the second half of the year , as retailers increase their purchases of our products in anticipation of the
holiday season. Delays in development, licensor approvals or manufacturing can af fect the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling
periods such as the year -end holiday buying season.
If our proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net, does not function properly , our business may be negatively impacted.
        If Blizzard's proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net, does not function as anticipated, Blizzard's games may be completely unavailable or Blizzard may
be prevented from delivering content digitally , which could result in a loss of sales for Blizzard's games. Further , any disruption in Battle.net's services could
negatively impact our business.
We depend on servers to operate our games with online features, as well as Battle.net, our digital service with online features. If we were to lose server
functionality , for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Our business relies on the continuous operation of servers which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we strive to maintain more than
sufficient server capacity , and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a
significant service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company
on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely interrupt the availability or operation of Blizzard's games,
and/or degrade or interrupt the functionality of other games of ours with online features, and could result in the loss of sales for , or in, such games (including
subscription-based sales for World of W arcraft ). This risk is particularly pronounced with respect to the mobile games published by King, which rely on a small
number of third-party owned data centers located in Stockholm, Sweden. An extended interruption of service could negatively impact our business.
        We must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands. If we
underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected, our consumers may experience
service problems, such as slow or interrupted gaming access. Insuf ficient server capacity
26
Table of Contents
could negatively impact our business. Conversely , if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur additional operating
costs.
If any of the networks operated by third parties on which we sell digital content for our console games or the online third-party platforms on which we
distribute our free-to-play games are unavailable for a prolonged period of time, our business could be negatively impacted.
        We rely on the networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live, for the sale and digital delivery of downloadable
console-game content. Similarly , we rely on the continued operation of the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook for the sale of virtual currency
for our free-to-play games. In the event the ef ficient operation and functionality of these third-party networks or platforms is interrupted for a prolonged period of
time, it could have a negative impact on our business.
We may not accurately predict the amount of Internet bandwidth or computational resources necessary to sustain our online gaming businesses.
        Our business is dependent on the availability of suf ficient Internet bandwidth and computational resources. If the price of either such resource increases, we
may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs. Because of the importance of our online business to our revenues and
results of operations, our ability to access adequate bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical.
        To secure access to such resources, we have entered into arrangements with several providers to secure future capacity , some of which involve long-term
contracts. If the price of such resources were to decrease, our contractual commitments to pay higher prices could af fect our ability to compete with other
publishers of interactive software products paying lower prices. Further , because we purchase additional capacity based on anticipated growth, our capacity is
sometimes lar ger than necessary to sustain our existing needs. If our projected online business growth is delayed or does not occur , we will incur lar ger expenses
for such resources than necessary . Conversely , if we underestimate the amount of bandwidth that our online business requires, and our purchased capacity is
insuf ficient to meet demand, our business may be negatively impacted.
We may be involved in legal proceedings that may result in material adverse outcomes.
        From time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business,
including actions with respect to intellectual property , competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment matters, unclaimed
property matters, compliance and commercial claims. Such claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their
results cannot be predicted with certainty . Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion
of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial settlements,
judgments, fines or penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from of fering certain features, functionalities, products or services,
requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.
We may be subject to intellectual property claims.
        As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software
developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims. Further , many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real
world things or people, which may also be the subject of intellectual property
27
Table of Contents
infringement claims of others, including right of publicity claims. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting-edge technology that may become
subject to emer ging intellectual property rights of others. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others, it is
possible that third parties still may claim infringement, particularly since there are an increasing number of companies that focus their ef forts exclusively on
enforcing their patent rights.
        From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or
not, may be time consuming, distracting to management and expensive to defend. Further , intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or
more of the following:
• cease selling, incorporating, supporting or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
• obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property , which if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable
terms; 
• redesign the af fected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce
commercial appeal of the af fected products; or 
• pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.
Issues with the toys, accessories or hardware peripherals utilized in certain of our games may lead to product liability , personal injury or property damage
claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities.
        We may experience issues with Skylanders toys and accessories or Guitar Hero hardware peripherals that may lead to product liability , personal injury or
property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. Any of these activities could result in increased
governmental scrutiny , harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, decreased willingness by our customers to purchase or by our
partners to provide marketing support for those products, denial or increased cost for insurance coverage, or additional safety and testing requirements. Such
results could divert development and management resources and increase legal fees and other costs, and otherwise could negatively impact our business.
Our products may be subject to legal claims.
        In prior years, lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies, including against Activision Blizzard, by the families of
victims of violence, alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence. These lawsuits have been
dismissed, but similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future. Although our general liability insurance carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature
with respect to the prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would do so in the future, or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts
for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor . Further , any such lawsuit could result in increased governmental scrutiny , harm
to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, or decreased willingness by our customers to purchase or by our partners to provide marketing
support for those products. Such results could divert development and management resources, increase legal fees and other costs and have other negative impacts
on our business.

Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us
from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. W e may also face legal risks arising out of user -generated content. Further , cheating, through use
of unauthorized "cheating" programs and other unauthorized software modifications by users, could lead to reductions in microtransactions in our games.
        We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and
employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. W e own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets.
The process of registering and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time-consuming. Further , we are aware that some unauthorized
copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur , it could negatively impact our business.
        Policing unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products is dif ficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and software piracy (including online piracy) is
a persistent problem for us. Further , the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual
property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be inef fective in such countries. In
addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products more dif ficult and to otherwise enforce and police our rights, as
do the manufacturers of consoles and the operators of other platforms on which many of our games are played, our ef forts and the ef forts of the console
manufacturers and platform operators may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products in all instances. T echnology designed to circumvent the
protection measures used in our products, the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the refusal of Internet service providers to remove infringing
content in certain instances, the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet sites and peer -to-peer networks, and Internet cafes using pirated
copies of our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy .
        In addition, unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, "cheating" programs or other unauthorized software tools and
modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games, such as those in our Candy Crush franchise, which could negatively impact the volume of
microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content. In addition, vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they run
could be discovered after their release, which may result in lost revenue opportunities. This may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of
developing technological measures to respond to these, either of which could negatively impact our business.
        We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emer ging technologies.
We rely on external developers to develop some of our software products.
        We rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products. Because we depend on these developers, we are subject to the following
risks:
• continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may cause
developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable
to us; 
• limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing
products or require us to fund additional costs;
29
Table of Contents
• a competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and, in either case, we would not
be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for any period of time for which those developers are contractually
obligated to complete development for us; and 
• reliance on external developers reduces our visibility into, and control over , development schedules and operational outcomes compared to those
when utilizing internal development resources.
        Increased competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game
developers. If the products subject to these arrangements do not generate suf ficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write-of f
unrecovered portions of these payments, which could negatively impact our business. T ypically , we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net
revenues from product sales, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after royalty
advances are fully recouped. T o the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, it could
negatively impact our business.
Our sales may decline substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because a substantial portion of our sales are made to a relatively small
number of key customers and because we do not have long -term contracts for the sale of our products.
        In the United States and Canada, our "boxed" products are often sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount
warehouses and game specialty stores. Our "boxed" products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term
agreements or other forms of commitments, and our retail customers and distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to
carry . The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision's principal retail customers or distributors could have adverse consequences. The
concentration of sales in a small number of lar ge customers also makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these lar ge customers becomes
unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. In addition, having such a lar ge portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a
few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.
Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other parties with whom we do business become unable to
honor their existing financial obligations to us or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.
        Some of our business partners are highly-leveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable to dif ficult economic conditions. As a result of
current economic conditions in some parts of the world, we are subject to heightened counterparty risks, including the risks that our business partners may default
on their obligations to us or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.
        For example, retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their
businesses and a number of them have failed. W e typically make sales to most retailers and some distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending
upon the customer's credit history , solvency , credit limits and sales history , as well as prevailing terms with similarly situated customers and whether suf ficient
credit insurance can be obtained. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a
result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-of f of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insuf ficient. Moreover ,
even in
30
Table of Contents
cases where we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against a customer's bankruptcy , insolvency or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant
deductible and co-payment obligation, and does not cover all instances of non-payment. Further , the insolvency or business failure of other types of business
partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be
favorable. A payment default by , or the insolvency or business failure of, a significant business partner could negatively impact our business.
Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other parties with whom we do business act in ways that
place our brand at risk.
        The actions of our business partners may put our business and our reputation at risk. In many cases, these third parties are given access to sensitive and
proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team. These third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use
of it. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, or the failure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services
and technologies, could result in a disruption to our business operations, and may negatively impact our business.
Our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of international trade.
        We conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of revenues and profits from international trade, particularly from Europe,
Asia and Australia. W e expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits in the future and,
moreover , that sales in emer ging markets in Asia and elsewhere will be an increasingly important part of our international sales.
        As such, we are, and may be increasingly , subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally , as well as risks inherent in doing business in emer ging markets,
including increased tarif fs and duties, compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation
costs, international political, regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws, regulatory requirements and enforcement on us and our
platform partners and dif fering local business practices, all of which may impact operating mar gins or make it more dif ficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct
business in foreign markets.
        A deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of
government regulations in such a country , including China in particular , could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic
sanctions, that could have a material adverse ef fect on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the
Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a
material adverse ef fect on our business. Additionally , in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our software. The
future implementation of similar laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our
products or may require engineering modifications to our products that are not cost-ef fective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to
the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. Further , the enforcement of regulation of mobile and other games with an online element in China
remains uncertain, and further changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could have a material impact on our business in China.
        We are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners,
representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have
policies and procedures, as well as training for our employees, intended to secure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, third-party partners,
representatives or agents may take actions
31
Table of Contents
that violate our policies. Moreover , it may be more dif ficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to
greater risk from their actions.
        In addition, cultural dif ferences may af fect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S, or require us to
modify the content of the games or the method by which we char ge our customers for the games in order to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer
preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, or if the other risks discussed herein come to fruition, it could negatively impact our business.
Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
        We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
provision for income taxes, and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
We are required to estimate future taxes. Although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimation process is inherently uncertain, and such
estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Further , our ef fective tax rate could be adversely af fected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business,
including the mix of earnings in countries with dif fering statutory tax rates, changes in tax elections, and changes in applicable tax laws. Additionally , tax
determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely af fect our income tax provision. Should the
ultimate tax liability exceed estimates, our income tax provision and net income could be materially adversely af fected.
        We earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, outside the United States. While our intent
is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States, any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions would likely result in higher
effective tax rates for the Company . In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational
corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether , or in what form, this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could negatively
impact our business.
        We are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property , and goods and services taxes, in both
the United States and various other jurisdictions. T ax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in
the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax matters may have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
        We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar , subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local
currencies, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar , Chinese renminbi, Swedish krona and Korean won, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar .
Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar , may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. W e have, in the past, utilized currency derivative contracts
to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures, with hedge maturities of generally less than 12 months, and managed these exposures with natural of fsets. However ,
there can be no assurance that we will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks
whether or not we do so.

Our reported financial results could be adversely af fected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting
standards to our business as it evolves.
        Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the methods,
estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies af fecting revenue recognition have and could further significantly af fect the
way we report revenues related to our products and services. W e recognize a majority of the revenues from bundled sales ( i.e., packaged goods video games that
include an online service component) on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the costs of sales of those
products. W e expect that an increasing number of our games will be online-enabled in the future and that we could be required to recognize the related revenues
over a period of time rather than at the time of sale. Further , as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of
the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance,
expand and diversify our business and product of ferings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way
we account for revenues and taxes, could have an adverse ef fect on our reported net revenues, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States in any given period.
Certain of our key operating metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our
reputation and negatively af fect our business.
        We track certain key operating metrics using internal tools, which have certain limitations. In addition, we rely on data received from third parties, including
third-party platforms, to track certain performance indicators. W e only have a limited ability to verify data from both of these sources.
        Our methodologies for tracking metrics may also change over time, which could result in changes to the metrics we report. If we undercount or overcount
performance due to the internal tools we use or issues with the data received from third parties, or if our internal tools contain errors, the data we report may not
be accurate or comparable with prior periods. In addition, limitations, changes or errors with respect to how we measure data may af fect our understanding of
certain details of our business, which could af fect our longer term strategies. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our financial or
operational performance, if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, or if we can no longer calculate any of our key performance metrics with a suf ficient
degree of accuracy and cannot find an adequate replacement for the metric, our business could be negatively impacted.
We may permit our customers to return products and to receive pricing concessions which could negatively impact our business.
        We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. In some cases, return policies allow
distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged and certain other products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and
applicable, allows these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise unsold by them. W e may permit product returns
from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. These conditions may include compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery of
weekly inventory and sales information and consistent participation in the launches of premium title releases. W e may also consider other factors, including the
facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other industry factors. When we of fer price protection, it may be of fered with respect to a particular product to all of
our distributors and retailer customers who meet the applicable conditions. Activision also of fers a 90-day limited warranty to its consumer end users that
Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection, and although we may place limits
on product returns and price protection, we
33
Table of Contents
could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to
distribution channels. W e face similar issues and risks, including exposure to risk of char gebacks, with respect to consumer end users to whom we sell products
directly , whether through Battle.net or otherwise.
We may face dif ficulty obtaining access to the retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products ef fectively .
        Retailers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition among consumer interactive
entertainment software products for high-quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. T o the extent that the number of products and platforms
increase, competition for shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Those issues are exacerbated to the extent any of
our products involve physical goods in addition to software and, as such, require additional shelf space, like the titles in our Skylanders franchise, which include
both action figures and accessories, as well as an electronic "portal", and the title in our Guitar Hero franchise, which includes a "life sized" guitar -shaped
controller . Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers. W e cannot be
certain that our new products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are
in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees and product return
policies. Our products constitute a relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. W e cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our
products or provide those products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms.
If our marketing and advertising ef forts fail to resonate with our consumers, our business could be negatively impacted.
        Our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell our products and services is
dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our consumers, particularly during the
critical holiday season or during other key selling periods, or advertising rates or other media placement costs increase, or if the use of cost-ef fective cross-
promotion within our mobile games to retain consumers becomes less ef fective, these factors could have a negative impact on our business.
Increased sales of used interactive entertainment products could lower our sales.
        Certain of our lar ger customers sell used interactive entertainment products, which are generally priced lower than new interactive entertainment products
and do not result in any revenues to the publisher of the games. Sales of used interactive entertainment products could negatively af fect our sales of new products.
Our games are subject to ratings, including the rating systems of the Entertainment Software Rating Board in the U.S. and similar agencies in international
jurisdictions. Our failure to obtain our target ratings for our products could negatively impact our business.
        The Entertainment Software Rating Board (the "ESRB") is a self-regulatory body based in the United States that provides consumers of interactive
entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity or sexual content contained in
software products. The ESRB rating categories are "Early Childhood" ( i.e., content is intended for young children), "Everyone" ( i.e., content is generally suitable
for all ages), "Everyone 10+" ( i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 10 and up), "T een" ( i.e., content is generally
34
Table of Contents
suitable for ages 13 and up), "Mature" ( i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 17 and up) and "Adults Only" ( i.e., content is suitable for adults ages 18 and up).
Our console and PC games are subject to ratings by the ESRB and some of our most significant titles have received a "Mature" rating, inherently limiting the
target audience. Certain countries other than the United States have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries.
Certain stores use other ratings systems, such as Apple's App Rating System and Google Play's use of the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) rating
system. In some instances, a company may be required to modify its products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt
the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. Further , if an agency re-rates one of our games for any reason, retailers
could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies purchased. If we are
unable to obtain the ratings we have tar geted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business.
Additional content -related policies adopted by retailers could negatively af fect sales of our products.
        Retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other
content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system, or
otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material
or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles with that retailer .
Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our
business could be materially adversely af fected.
        Legislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may af fect the way in which we, and
other industry participants, may of fer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. Many foreign countries, such as China and Germany , have
laws that permit governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products because of the content
therein (and similar legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the United States). Further , the growth and
development of electronic commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional
burdens on or limitations on operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. W e are also subject to laws and
regulations related to protection of minors, consumer privacy , advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property , distribution, and antitrust, among others.
Furthermore, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, regulation of currency , banking institutions, unclaimed property , and money
laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. The adoption and enforcement of legislation which restricts the marketing, content, business
model, or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to of fer to our customers and
the size of the potential market for our products may be limited. W e may be required to modify certain product development processes or products or alter our
marketing strategies to comply with such regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. The laws and regulations af fecting our products
vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another , imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may
also result in government-imposed fines or other penalties, as well as harm to our reputation. Moreover , the public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment
may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers' willingness to purchase our products. The King Acquisition has significantly increased our user
population, and may
35
Table of Contents
subject us to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions and exacerbate the potential adverse impact on our business.
        Although we have structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind, including any applicable laws relating to gambling, and believe
that playing these games does not constitute gambling, our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and
expose us to civil and criminal penalties. W e also sometimes of fer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional
opportunities. W e are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and of fering of such activities and games, many of which are still
evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. If these were to occur , we might be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals
from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements, and we may be subject to additional
regulation and oversight, such as reporting to regulators, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or
the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of casual game services
and impair our business.
The laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.
        Consumers can play certain of our games online using third-party platforms and networks and on mobile devices. W e collect and store significant amounts of
information about our consumers of these games—both personally identifying and non-personally identifying information. W e are subject to laws from a variety
of jurisdictions regarding privacy and the protection of this information. For example, the European Union (the "E.U.") has traditionally taken a broader view than
the United States and certain other jurisdictions as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy regulations.
The U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPP A") also regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under
13 years of age. Failure to comply with COPP A may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations, and result in
substantial fines.
        Data privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, which could impact our approach to operating
and marketing our games. For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union's recent decision to invalidate the E.U.-U.S. Safe Harbor regime that
legitimized the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. was a material change to laws on data privacy applicable to our business. The European
Commission and the U.S. government have recently agreed to a new framework for transatlantic data flows known as the "E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield," which is
intended to replace the Safe Harbor regime, but the details of how this will operate in practice and the compliance implications for our business are not yet clear .
The U.S. government, including the Federal T rade Commission and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over the
collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices, and the E.U. has proposed reforms to its
existing data protection legal framework. V arious government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry
practices. In addition, in some cases, we are dependent upon our platform providers to solicit, collect and provide us with information regarding our consumers
that is necessary for compliance with these various types of regulations.
        Player interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policy , end user license agreements, and terms of service. If we fail to comply with our posted
privacy policy , EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could result in
proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, impact our
financial condition and harm our business. If
36
Table of Contents
regulators, the media, or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also
result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, negatively impact our financial condition, and damage our business.
We may not be able to maintain our distribution relationships with key vendors and customers.
        We have subsidiaries that distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware products and provide related services in Germany and the United
Kingdom, respectively , and via export in other European countries for a variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our competitors, and
hardware manufacturers. From time to time, these subsidiaries also maintain exclusive relationships to serve certain retail customers. These services are generally
performed subject to limited-term arrangements. Although we expect to use reasonable ef forts to retain these vendors and retail customer relationships, we may
not be successful in this regard. The cancellation or non-renewal of one or more of these arrangements could negatively impact our business.
Credit card or other fraud could have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
        A substantial portion of the subscription revenues generated by World of W arcraft , as well as revenues generated from other sales through Battle.net, are paid
by subscribers using credit cards. At times, there may be attempts to use fraudulently obtained credit card numbers to pay for our products and services.
Additionally , the credit card numbers and other sensitive or personally identifiable information of World of W arcraft's  subscribers and Battle.net account holders
are maintained in a proprietary database that may be subject to malicious intrusion by hackers or otherwise compromised internally or externally . As fraudulent
schemes become more sophisticated, it may become more dif ficult and more costly for us to detect credit card or other fraud and we may be required to incur
costs to implement additional security measures to protect subscriber information. An increase in credit card or other fraud could have adverse consequences. In
addition, we may be subject to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of
or access to our customers' credit card or other sensitive or personally identifiable information.
Data breaches involving the source code for our products or customer , consumer or employee data stored by us, or by a third party operating on our behalf,
could negatively impact our business.
        In the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store and/or use commercially sensitive information, such as the
source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and confidential information with respect to our customers, consumers and
employees. A  malicious intrusion by hackers or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personally
identifiable information) and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity , disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to,
our customers', consumers' or employees' personally identifiable information or our own sensitive business data. A data intrusion into a server for a game with
online features or for Battle.net could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform. If we are subject to data security breaches, or a security-related incident
which materially disrupts the availability of our products and services, we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other
costs, including from the implementation of additional security measures, or suf fer reputational damage. Moreover , even if there were a public perception that our
data protection measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or the
public perception of our business model. In addition, we may be subject to legal claims or proceedings in connection with data security breaches, including
regulatory investigations and actions.

We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could negatively
impact our business.
        We rely on the ef ficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within Activision Blizzard
and some of which are managed and/or hosted by third-party providers. All information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or
interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber - attacks, malicious software, security breach, ener gy blackouts, natural disasters,
terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. W e may also face sophisticated attacks, referred to as advanced persistent threats, which are cyber -attacks aimed
at compromising our intellectual property and other commercially-sensitive information, such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential
customer or employee information, which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time. Information technology system or network failure or security breach
could negatively impact our business continuity , operations and financial results. These risks extend to the networks and e-commerce sites of console platform
providers and other partners who sell and host our content online. W e may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security
breaches.
Our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of of fensive consumer -created content.
        We are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments, in real time, that
are visible to other consumers. From time to time, objectionable and of fensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features
or game forums which allow consumers to post comments. W e may be subject to lawsuits, governmental regulation or restrictions, and consumer backlash
(including decreased sales and harmed reputation), as a result of consumers posting of fensive content. W e may also be subject to consumer backlash from
comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as Facebook, Y ouTube and Twitter .
If one or more of our titles were found to contain objectionable undisclosed content, our business may be negatively impacted.
        Throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry , many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden gameplay
features, some of which have been accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the gameplay
experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to disclose pertinent
hidden content during the ESRB ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose hidden content, and the ESRB has required the recall of the
game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the game or game packaging and/or
imposed fines on the publisher . Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves,
refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some interactive entertainment software consumers have
reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from
buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the
publisher of the product containing such content.
        We have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software
products we publish. Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error , circumvention, overriding and reasonable resource constraints. If an
interactive software product we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.

We may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.
        In the event of a significant decline in demand for one or more of our products, we may not be able to reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost
structure without disrupting our operations or incurring costs. Further , we may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner , if at all, to of fset an
immediate shortfall in revenues and profit. Moreover , cost-reduction actions may decrease our employee morale and result in the failure to execute upon our
business plan due to the loss of employees or impact our ability to retain or recruit key employees. In addition, any such action may involve the risk that our
senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.
        Our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings.
The regulations on shareholder action could make it more dif ficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of
actions that would support this ef fort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called "blank check"
preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could ef fectively dilute the interests of any
person seeking control or otherwise make it more dif ficult to obtain control.
We have a number of large shareholders who may sell a large volume of our stock, which could cause our stock price to decrease.
        We have a number of lar ge shareholders, including ASAC. The sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by ASAC or any other lar ge
shareholder within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease, and make it more dif ficult for us to raise funds through future of ferings of shares
of our common stock.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
        Our corporate headquarters and our primary corporate disaster center are located in the Los Angeles, California area and our disaster recovery data center is
in Las V egas, Nevada, each of which is near a major earthquake fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption
of any of our critical business or information technology systems, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations, could require
significant expenditures to resume operations and have a material adverse ef fect on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events,
the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further , our system redundancy may be inef fective or
inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be suf ficient for all eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers, distributors or our
other customers to sell or distribute our products.
If general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.
        Purchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary
purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are
sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in
our selling and promotional expenses, in an ef fort to of fset that reduction, and could have a material adverse ef fect on our business.

The uncertainty of worldwide economic conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very dif ficult.
        We are unable to predict worldwide economic conditions, and all of the ef fects those conditions may have on our business. In particular , the uncertainty of
future worldwide economic conditions subjects our forecasts to heightened risks and uncertainties.

        None.
Item 2.    PROPER TIES 
        Our principal corporate and administrative of fices are located at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California. Other significant leased facilities
include: our Blizzard of fices located in Irvine, California and our North America distribution warehouse located in Fresno, California.
        The following is a summary of the principal leased of fices we maintained as of December 31, 2015:
        In total, we lease 64 facilities in the following 17 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany , Ireland, Italy , Mexico, the Netherlands,
Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, T aiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. W e anticipate no dif ficulty in extending the leases of our facilities
or obtaining comparable facilities in suitable locations, as needed, and we consider our facilities to be adequate for our current needs. The only facilities currently
owned by the Company are two European warehouses utilized by the Distribution segment, located in Bur glengenfeld, Germany and V enlo, the Netherlands.
Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
        We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims. SEC regulations govern disclosure of legal proceedings in periodic reports and Financial Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") T opic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect
of litigation and other claims. W e record an accrual for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher
amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Moreover , even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure
related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible ( i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential
material adverse impacts on us.
        The outcomes of legal proceedings and other claims are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. There is significant
judgment required in the analysis of these matters, including the probability determination and whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In
making these determinations, we, in consultation with outside counsel, examine the

matters are inherently unpredictable and the timing of development of factors on which reasonable judgments and estimates can be based can be slow . As such,
there can be no assurance that the final outcome of any legal matter will not materially and adversely af fect our business, financial condition, results of
operations, profitability , cash flows or liquidity .
Purchase T ransaction Matters
        In prior periods, the Company reported on litigation related to the Purchase T ransaction. During the period ended June 30, 2015, the cases were resolved and
dismissed with prejudice. As part of the resolution of the claims, we received a settlement payment of $202 million in July 2015 from V ivendi, ASAC, and our
insurers. W e recorded the settlement within "Shareholders' equity" in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
Other Matters
        In addition, we are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including with
respect to intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance
matters, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we
do not expect them to have a material adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity .

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF OPERA TIONS 
Business Overview
        Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company ," "we,"
"us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Business Combination and Shar e Repur chase
        Activision, Inc. was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992.
        Activision Blizzard is the result of the 2008 business combination ("Business Combination") by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.),
Sego Mer ger Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision, Inc., V ivendi S.A. ("V ivendi"), VGAC LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of V ivendi, and
Vivendi Games, Inc. ("V ivendi Games"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of VGAC LLC. As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination,
Activision, Inc. was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. and V ivendi became a majority shareholder of Activision Blizzard. Activision Blizzard is a public
company traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "A TVI."
        On October 1 1, 2013, we repurchased approximately 429 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase
Agreement") we entered into with V ivendi and ASAC II LP ("ASAC"), an exempted limited partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands, acting
by its general partner , ASAC II LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired all of the capital stock of Amber Holding
Subsidiary Co., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of V ivendi ("New VH"), which was the direct owner of approximately 429 million shares
of our common stock, for a cash payment of $5.83 billion, or $13.60 per share, before taking into account the benefit to the Company of certain tax attributes of
New VH assumed in the transaction (collectively , the "Purchase T ransaction"). Refer to Note 1 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding the financing of the Purchase T ransaction.
        Immediately following the completion of the Purchase T ransaction, ASAC purchased from V ivendi 172 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to the
Stock Purchase Agreement, for a cash payment of $2.34 billion, or $13.60 per share (the "Private Sale"). Robert A. Kotick, our Chief Executive Of ficer, and
Brian G. Kelly , Chairman of our Board of Directors, are af filiates of ASAC II LLC.
        On May 28, 2014, V ivendi sold approximately 41 million shares, or approximately 50% of its then-current holdings, of our common stock in a registered
public of fering. Vivendi received proceeds of approximately $850 million from that sale; we did not receive any proceeds.
        As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 734 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. At that date, (i) Vivendi held 41 million
shares, or approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (ii) ASAC held 172 million shares, or approximately 23% of the outstanding shares
of our common stock, and (iii) our other stockholders held approximately 71% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.
        On January 13, 2016, V ivendi sold all of their remaining shares of our common stock. W e did not receive any proceeds.

The King Acquisition
        On November 2, 2015, we and King Digital Entertainment plc, a leading interactive entertainment company for the mobile world incorporated under the
laws of Ireland ("King"), entered into a T ransaction Agreement (the "T ransaction Agreement") under the terms of which we would acquire King (the "King
Acquisition") and King would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company . On February 23, 2016 we completed the King Acquisition under the terms of
the T ransaction Agreement. W e transferred $5.9 billion in consideration to the existing King shareholders and share-based award holders.
        The Company made this acquisition because it believes that the addition of King's highly-complementary mobile business will position the Company as a
global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, and positions the company for future growth. The combined company has a
world-class interactive entertainment portfolio of top-performing franchises.
        As the closing of the King Acquisition occurred subsequent to December 31, 2015, our financial results as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, do
not contain the results of King.
Reportable Segments
        Based upon our or ganizational structure, we conduct our business through two reportable operating segments, Activision Publishing, Inc. and Blizzard
Entertainment, Inc. Previously , we reported "Distribution" as a reportable segment. In the current period, this was no longer deemed a separate reportable segment
and is included in "Other", along with our recently announced media networks and film and television studio businesses.

PS4, with an expected release date to other platforms of March 3, 2016.
International Operations
        International sales are a fundamental part of our business. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 48%, 50%, and 47% of our
total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively . In addition to our United States ("U.S.") operations, we
maintain significant operations in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany , Ireland, Italy , the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United
Kingdom ("U.K."). An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Our
international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in
local economies. Accordingly , our future results could be materially and adversely af fected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local
economies.
Management's Overview of Business T rends
Digital Revenues
        We provide our products through both retail and digital distribution channels. Many of our video games that are available through retailers as physical
"boxed" software products are also available digitally (from our websites and from websites and digital distribution channels owned by third parties). In addition,
we of fer players digital downloadable content as add-ons to our products ( e.g., new multi-player content packs or in-game microtransactions), generally for a one-
time fee. W e also of fer subscription-based services and other value-added services for World of W arcraft , all of which are digitally delivered and hosted by
Battle.net.
        We currently define sales via digital online channels as revenues from digitally distributed subscriptions, licensing royalties, value-added services,
downloadable content, microtransactions, and products. This definition may dif fer from that used by our competitors or other companies.
        According to Activision Blizzard internal estimates, digital gaming revenues for the interactive entertainment industry in 2015, increased by approximately
20% as compared to 2014. The primary drivers of the increase in digital gaming revenues were increases in microtransactions and consumer purchases of full
games via digital channels. In addition to increasing microtransactions within free-to-play games, the increase includes microtransactions within purchased game
software, as publishers of fer increasingly new opportunities for monetization within their games to extend and enlar ge the monetization cycle. Digital revenues
are an important part of our business, and we continue to focus on and develop products, such as downloadable content, that can be delivered via digital channels.
The amount of our digital revenues in any period may fluctuate depending, in part, on the timing and nature of our specific product releases. Our sales of digital
downloadable content are driven in part by sales of, and engagement by players in, our retail products. As such, lower revenues in our
49
Table of Contents
retail distribution channels in one year may impact our revenues through digital online channels in the subsequent year .
        For the year ended December 31, 2015, net revenues through digital online channels increased by $605 million, as compared to 2014, and represented 54%
of our total consolidated net revenues, as compared to 43% in 2014. On a non-GAAP basis (which excludes the impact of deferred revenues), net revenues
through digital online channels for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $430 million, as compared to 2014, and represented 57% of our total non-
GAAP net revenues, as compared to 46% in 2014.
        Please refer to the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures later in this document for further discussions of retail and digital online
channels.
Console Platform T ransition
        In November 2013, Sony released the PS4 and Microsoft released the Xbox One, their respective next-generation game consoles and entertainment systems.
According to The NPD Group and GfK Chart-T rack in North America and Europe, as of December 31, 2015, the combined installed base of PS4 and Xbox One
hardware was approximately 43 million units, representing growth of approximately 82% over the combined installed base of approximately 24 million units as
of December 31, 2014. While the combined installed base of PS3 and Xbox 360 hardware was approximately 124 million units as of December 31, 2015, at the
comparable point in their release cycle, the prior -generation platforms had only 28 million units installed.
        When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers reduce their purchases of game console software products for prior -
generation console platforms in anticipation of new platforms becoming available. During these periods, sales of the game console software products we publish
slow or even decline until the new platforms introduced achieve wide consumer acceptance, which we believe had lar gely occurred with respect to the next-
generation platforms by the end of 2015. W e believe that for 2016, the sales impact from the console transition will not be a meaningful driver of the business.
        During platform transitions, we simultaneously incur costs to develop and market new titles for prior -generation video game platforms and to develop and
market products for next-generation platforms. W e continually monitor console hardware sales and manage our product delivery on each of the prior - and next-
generation platforms in a manner we believe to be most ef fective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in
product development.
Concentration of T op Titles
        The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry . According to The NPD Group, the
top 10 titles accounted for 33% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2015. Similarly , a significant portion of our revenues has
historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of
our profits. For example, the Call of Duty , World of Warcraft, Skylanders, and Destiny franchises combined accounted for 71%, 72%, and 80% of our
consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively , and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income.
As a result, successful competition against these titles can significantly impact our performance. Notably in 2015, the toys to life category became more
competitive with a new entrant competing directly with us and other incumbents.
        We are continually exploring additional investments in existing and future franchises. During 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm , as well as Call of Duty
Online  in China. In the fourth quarter of 2015,
50
Table of Contents
we released Overwatch  into closed beta with an anticipated game release in spring of 2016. There is no guarantee these investments will result in an established
franchise.
        Additionally , on February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, diversifying our portfolio of key franchises.
        Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our , and the industry's,
revenues and profits in the near future.
Seasonality
        While our business is transitioning to a year -round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains highly seasonal. We have historically
experienced our highest sales volume in the year -end holiday buying season, which occurs in the fourth quarter . We defer the recognition of a significant amount
of our net revenues, related to our software titles containing online functionality that constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable, over an
extended period of time ( i.e., typically less than a year). As a result, the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be dif ferent than the quarter in
which we recognize the highest amount of net revenues. Our results can also vary based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, title release date,
consumer demand, market conditions and shipment schedules.
Outlook
        For 2016, our results will include the operations of King, beginning on February 23, 2016, the date the King Acquisition closed. Our earnings under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") are expected to be down versus prior -year , as the expected results will be
impacted by additional accounting char ges associated with the King Acquisition, which include, among other things, integration and acquisition-related costs, the
amortization of intangible assets resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments, and the related tax impact from the King Acquisition. The majority of
these GAAP accounting char ges will not impact the economics or operating cash flows of our business, although they will have a material impact on our 2016
GAAP results.
        For Activision, we expect to deliver multiple map packs to Call of Duty: Black Ops III,  along with additional in-game content, during 2016. For the Destiny
franchise, Activision expects to deliver a new expansion in 2016 with the full-game Destiny sequel to come in 2017. Also in the fourth quarter of 2016,
Activision plans to release new Call of Duty and Skylanders games. Blizzard plans to release Overwatch  in the spring of 2016, as well as World of W arcraft:
Legion™  in the summer of 2016. In addition, Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft  and Heroes of the Storm  will have ongoing content updates throughout the year .

Operating Segment Results
        Our operating segments are consistent with our internal or ganizational structure, the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief
Executive Of ficer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), the manner in which we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the
availability of separate financial information. Currently , we have two reportable operating segments (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Previously , we reported "Distribution" as a reportable segment. In the current period, this was no longer deemed a reportable segment and is included
in "Other" along with our recently announced Media Networks and Studios businesses. W e do not aggregate operating segments.
        The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our
online-enabled games, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting, and fees and other expenses
(including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals) related to acquisitions and the Purchase T ransaction. The CODM does not review any information regarding
total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly , no disclosure is made with respect thereto. Information on the operating segments and reconciliations

Net Effect fr om Deferral of Net Revenues and Related Cost of Sales
        We have determined that some of our titles' online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result, represents a more-than-
inconsequential separate deliverable. As such, we are required to recognize revenues from these titles over the estimated service periods, which are generally less
than one year . The related costs of sales are deferred and recognized when the related revenues are recognized. In the operating segment results table, we present
the amount of net revenues and related costs of sales separately for each period as a result of this accounting treatment.

Table of Contents
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
        We expense our stock-based awards using the grant date fair value over the vesting periods of the stock awards. In the case of liability awards, the liability is
subject to revaluation based on the stock price at the end of the relevant period. Included within this stock-based compensation are the net ef fects of capitalization,
deferral, and amortization.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
        We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the underlying economic benefits. The amount
presented in the table represents the ef fect of the amortization of intangible assets, as well as other purchase price accounting adjustments, where applicable, in
our consolidated statements of operations.
Fees and Other Expenses Related to Acquisitions and the Pur chase T ransaction
        We incurred fees and other expenses, such as legal, banking and professional services fees, related to the Purchase T ransaction, the King Acquisition, and
other business acquisitions, inclusive of related debt financings. Such expenses are not reviewed by the CODM as part of segment performance.
Segment Net Revenues
Activision
        Activision's net revenues increased slightly for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher revenues from the Call of Duty franchise, specifically
from Call of Duty: Black Ops III , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e, which was released in the
fourth quarter of 2014, and the strong digital content performance, including expansion packs and supply drops for Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e. Additionally ,
revenue increased due to revenues from Guitar Her o Live , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, with no comparable release in the prior -year . These
increases were partially of fset by lower revenues from Skylanders SuperChar gers, which was released in the current year , as compared to Skylanders T rap T eam,
the comparable prior -year title, lower revenues from the Destiny franchise as Destiny  debuted in September 2014 with no comparable full-game release in 2015,
and lower revenues from The Amazing Spider -Man 2 , which was released during the prior -year with no corresponding release during 2015.
        Activision's net revenues decreased for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower revenues from the Call of Duty and Skylanders franchises,
partially of fset by higher revenues from the release of Destiny  and its first expansion pack, The Dark Below , in 2014.
Blizzard
        Blizzard's net revenues decreased for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the timing of game releases; most notably Diablo III: Reaper of Souls™,
which was released in March 2014 on the PC, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition™,  which was released in August 2014 on consoles, and World
of Warcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor® , which was released in November 2014, along with the overall lower revenues from World of W arcraft  due to a smaller
subscriber base. These decreases were partially of fset by higher revenues from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft,  which had multiple content releases throughout
the year , along with revenues from Heroes of the Storm  and Starcraft II: Legacy of the V oid, which were released in 2015. In addition to already having been
released on PC, iPad, and Android tablets in the prior -year , Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft  was released on iPhone and Android smartphones in April 2015,
which contributed to the current period revenue performance.
        Blizzard's net revenues increased for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to revenues from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls,  which was released in March
2014 on the PC, and Diablo III: Reaper of

Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition,  which was released in August 2014 on certain consoles, revenue from value-added services as a result of the launch of the World of
Warcraft  paid character boost, revenues from World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor , which was released in November 2014, and revenues from Hearthstone:
Heroes of W arcraft,  which was commercially released in 2014, as compared to revenues in 2013 from StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm ®, which was released in
March 2013, and from Diablo III  on consoles, which was released in September 2013.
Segment Income fr om Operations
Activision
        Activision's operating income increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to an increased percentage of revenues coming from the higher mar gin
online digital channels, and lower sales and marketing spending on the Destiny franchise because of the September 2014 launch of Destiny  with no comparable
full-game release in the current year . This is partially of fset by operating losses from Guitar Her o Live , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, with no
comparable release in the prior -year , and lower revenues from Skylanders SuperChar gers as compared to Skylanders T rap T eam.
        Activision's operating income decreased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower revenues, as described above, relatively higher cost of sales—
software royalties and amortization, and higher sales and marketing activities from the release of Destiny ; partially of fset by lower cost of sales—product costs as
a result of lower revenues, and lower general and administrative costs, primarily resulting from lower legal-related expenses (including legal-related accruals,
settlements and fees).
Blizzard
        Blizzard's operating income decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to lower revenues, as described above; higher costs of sales—product
costs from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft  related to commissions on mobile purchases with the launch on iPhone and Android smartphones in April 2015;
higher sales and marketing spending for its releases, including Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft  and Heroes of the Storm ; lower capitalization of software
development costs; and higher cost of sales—software royalties and amortization.
        Blizzard's operating income increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to higher revenues, as described above, partially of fset by higher cost of
sales—product costs, higher product development costs and higher sales and marketing activities to support a higher number of titles released in 2014.
Foreign Exchange Impact
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $364 million on Activision Blizzard's segment net revenues for 2015 as compared to the same
period in the previous year . The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound.
Non-GAAP Financial Measur es
        The analysis of revenues by distribution channel is presented both on a GAAP (including the impact from the change in deferred revenues) and non-GAAP
(excluding the impact from the change in deferred revenues) basis. W e use this non-GAAP measure internally when evaluating our operating performance, when
planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of our management team. W e believe this is appropriate because this non-
GAAP measure enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers, which is consistent with the way the Company
is measured by investment analysts and industry data
55
Table of Contents
sources, and facilitates comparison of operating performance between periods. In addition, excluding the impact from the change in deferred net revenue provides
a much more timely indication of trends in our sales and other operating results. While we believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful in evaluating our
business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for , or as more
important than, the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP . In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be the same as any
non-GAAP measure presented by another company . This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the items associated with
our GAAP  revenues. W e compensate for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of the change in deferred revenues by considering the impact of that item
separately and by considering our GAAP , as well as non-GAAP , revenues.

Retail Channel Net Revenues
        The decrease in GAAP net revenues from retail channels for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to lower revenues from Skylanders
SuperChar gers, which was released in the current year , as compared to Skylanders T rap T eam, the comparable prior -year title, lower revenues recognized from
Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014, as compared to Call of Duty: Ghosts , which was released in the fourth quarter
of 2013, and lower revenues recognized from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls  and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition,  which were released in March
2014 on PC and in August 2014 on consoles, respectively . The decreases were partially of fset by higher revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise and
revenues from Guitar Her o Live,  which was released in October 2015.
        The decrease in GAAP net revenues from retail channels for 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to lower revenues from the Call of Duty and
Skylanders franchises. The decreases were partially of fset by revenues from Destiny , which was released in September 2014, and revenues from Diablo III:
Reaper of Souls,  which was released in March 2014 on the PC, and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition , which was released in August 2014 on
certain consoles.
        The decrease in non-GAAP net revenues from retail channels for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to lower revenues from Destiny , which
launched in September 2014 with no comparable full-game release in the current year , from Skylanders SuperChar gers, which was released in the current year , as
compared to Skylanders T rap T eam, the comparable prior -year title, and from the Diablo franchise due to timing of title releases. This was partially of fset by
revenues from Guitar Her o Live , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, with no comparable release in the prior -year , and revenues from Call of Duty:
Black Ops III , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e, which was released in the fourth quarter of

Digital Channel Net Revenues
        The increase in GAAP net revenues from digital online channels for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to: higher revenues recognized from the
Destiny franchise; higher revenues recognized from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft ; higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e and its
digital content released during the current period, as compared to Call of Duty: Ghosts  and its digital content released during the prior period, including revenues
recognized from Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e's new digital content known as "supply drops;" and revenues recognized from Heroes of the Storm , which was
released in June 2015 with no comparable release during the prior periods. The increases were partially of fset by lower revenues from the Diablo franchise due to
the timing of title releases.
57(3) We have determined that some of our titles' online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result, represents
a more-than inconsequential separate deliverable. As such, we recognize revenues attributed to these titles over the estimated service
periods, which are generally less than one year . In the table above, we present the amount of net revenues for each period as a result of
this accounting treatment.

Table of Contents
        The increase in GAAP net revenues from digital online channels for 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to higher revenues from Hearthstone:
Heroes of W arcraft,  value-added services revenues from the launch of the World of W arcraft  paid character boost, revenues from World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of
Draenor , revenues from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls,  which was released in March 2014 on the PC, and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition ,
which was released in August 2014 on certain consoles, and the release of Destiny  and its first expansion pack, The Dark Below , and higher digital download
revenues from Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e. The increases were partially of fset by lower revenues recognized from StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm , which
was released in March 2013, lower revenues recognized from World of W arcraft: Mists of Pandaria® , which was released in September 2012, and lower
downloadable content revenues from the Call of Duty franchise.
        The increase in non-GAAP net revenues from digital online channels for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to: revenues from Hearthstone:
Heroes of W arcraft;  revenues from Destiny  and its associated expansion packs, including The T aken King  which was released in September 2015; higher revenues
from the Call of Duty franchise, specifically from Call of Duty: Black Ops III , which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to Call of Duty:
Advanced W arfar e, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014, and from the strong digital content performance, including expansion packs and supply
drops, of Call of Duty: Advanced W arfar e; and revenues from Heroes of the Storm , which was released in June 2015 with no comparable release during the prior
periods. These increases were partially of fset by lower revenues from World of W arcraft , primarily due to a decline in the subscriber base and the launch of World
of Warcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor  in November 2014 with no comparable release in the current year , and lower revenues recognized from the Diablo franchise
due to the timing of title releases.
        The increase in non-GAAP net revenues from digital online channels for 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to revenues from Hearthstone:

Consolidated Net Revenues
        Consolidated net revenues in the North America region increased in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher revenues recognized from the
Destiny franchise, higher revenues recognized from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft , and revenues recognized from Heroes of the Storm  and Guitar Her o Live ,
which were both released in 2015 with no comparable releases during the prior periods. The increases were partially of fset by lower revenues from Skylanders
SuperChar gers,  as compared to Skylanders T rap T eam, and lower revenues recognized from the Diablo franchise due to the timing of title releases.
        Consolidated net revenues in the Europe region decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to lower revenues recognized from the Diablo and
Call of Duty franchises, lower revenues from Skylanders SuperChar gers, as compared to Skylanders T rap T eam, and lower revenues from our Distribution
business. These were partially of fset by higher revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, higher revenues recognized from Hearthstone: Her oes of
Warcraft , and revenues recognized from Heroes of the Storm .
        Consolidated net revenues in the Asia Pacific region increased in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher revenues recognized from Hearthstone:
Heroes of W arcraft, Call of Duty Online,  and Heroes of the Storm , which launched in China in 2015 with no comparable prior -year titles. The increases were
partially of fset by lower revenues from the Diablo franchise.
        Consolidated net revenues in all regions decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013, except for the Asia Pacific region. As previously discussed, the decrease in
the Company's consolidated net revenues in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, was mainly due to lower revenues from the Call of Duty and
Skylanders franchises, lower revenues recognized from StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm , which was released in March 2013, and lower revenues recognized
from World of W arcraft: Mists of Pandaria , which was released in September 2012. The decreases were partially of fset by the launch of Destiny  and its first
expansion pack, The Dark Below , revenues from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft,  value-added services revenues from the launch of the World of W arcraft  paid
character boost, revenues from World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor , and revenues from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls,  which was released in March 2014 on the
PC, and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition , which was released in August 2014 on certain consoles. All of the above factors impact our year -
over-year comparisons for North America and Europe. Further , in the Europe region, the decreases were partially of fset by the increase in Distribution segment
revenues. In the Asia Pacific region, the higher mix of Blizzard segment operations, as compared to Publishing segment operations, resulted in a year -over -year
increase in revenues.

Deferr ed Revenues Recognized
        In all regions, the increase in deferred revenues recognized in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to lower deferrals of revenue from Destiny ,
from World of W arcraft , primarily associated with World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor  and value-added services, and from the Diablo franchise. These were
partially of fset by increased deferrals of revenue from the Call of Duty franchise and deferral of revenues for StarCraft II: Legacy of the V oid and Guitar Her o
Live, which were released in 2015 with no comparable prior -year releases. Additionally , in the Asia Pacific region there was an increase deferral of revenues from
Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft .
        In all regions, the decrease in deferred revenues recognized in 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily attributed to the higher deferral of revenues from
World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor , which was released in November 2014, as compared to the recognition of revenues from World of W arcraft: Mists of
Pandaria , which was released in September 2012, deferral of revenues from Destiny  and its first expansion pack The Dark Below , both of which were released in
2014, and the deferral of revenues from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft , which was also released in 2014.
Foreign Exchange Impact
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $373 million, a negative impact of $2 million, and a positive impact of $33 million on Activision
Blizzard's consolidated net revenues in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively , as compared to the same periods in the previous year . The changes are primarily due
to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound.
        For the year ended December 31, 2014, given that a significant portion of the Company's GAAP net consolidated revenues is generated in the first half of the
fiscal year due to the impact of deferrals, where the euro and British pound strengthened against the U.S dollar as compared to the same period in 2013, the
negative impact from the significant weakening of the euro and British pound relative to U.S. dollar in the later stages of 2014 was lar gely of fset in the
Company's consolidated net revenues for the full year 2014.

millions):
        Net revenues from online decreased slightly in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to lower World of W arcraft  subscriber levels. This was partially
offset by revenue recognized from the expansion World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor , which was released in November 2014, and from associated value-
added services including a paid character boost.
        Net revenues from online decreased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to the deferral of revenues from World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor ,
as compared to the recognition of revenues from World of W arcraft: Mists of Pandaria , which was released in September 2012, and lower subscription revenues
from World of W arcraft . The decrease was partially of fset by the strong performance of value-added services revenues driven by the launch of the World of
Warcraft  paid character boost.
        Net revenues from PC increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher revenues recognized from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft  and
revenues recognized from Heroes of the Storm . This was partially of fset by lower revenues recognized in 2015 from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls , due to the title
releasing in March 2014 and no comparable title release in 2015.
        Net revenues from PC increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to revenues from Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft,  which had no comparable

intellectual property licenses in 2013, with no comparable write-downs in 2014, lower amortization of our intangible assets, and a reduction in the number of
titles released by our value business in 2014, which are normally based on licensed properties.
Product Development (amounts in millions)
        For 2015, product development costs increased, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased costs to support our future title releases and increased
Blizzard product development costs, primarily associated with higher payroll costs and bonuses to studio personnel.
        For 2014, product development costs decreased, as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expenses associated with employees
involved in product development as a result of fewer shares granted and fewer shares and options vested during the year .
Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions)
        Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased spending on sales and marketing activities to support the
launch of Guitar Her o Live  and Heroes of the Storm  during the year . The increase was partially of fset by lower media spending on the W orld of W arcraft, Destiny ,
and Diablo franchises due to the timing of title releases.
        Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to increased spending on sales and marketing activities to support the
launch of Destiny , Hearthstone: Her oes of W arcraft , and World of W arcraft: W arlor ds of Draenor  during the year . The increase was partially of fset by lower
media spending on the Call of Duty and Skylanders franchises.
General and Administrative (amounts in millions)
        General and administrative expenses decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our foreign currency
derivative contracts and lower stock-based compensation expense. This decrease was partially of fset by increased professional service fees incurred, primarily in
connection with the King Acquisition.
        General and administrative expenses decreased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to the lower bankers' and professional fees related to the
Purchase T ransaction and related debt financings in 2014, as compared to 2013.

Inter est and Other Expense, Net (amounts in millions)
        Interest and other expense, net, in 2015 was comparable to 2014.
        Interest and other expense, net, was $202 million in 2014, as compared to $53 million in 2013, reflecting a full year of interest expense incurred from the
Notes and the Term Loan, which were issued and drawn, respectively , in October 2013. Interest expense for 2013 reflects interest from the period in which the
Notes and the T erm Loan were issued and drawn, respectively , to the end of the year .
Income T ax Expense (Benefit) (amounts in millions)
        For the year ended December , 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1,121 million, $981 million, and
$1,319 million, respectively , and our income tax expense was $229 million (or a 20% ef fective tax rate), $146 million (or a 15% ef fective tax rate), and
$309 million (or a 23% ef fective tax rate), respectively . Overall, our ef fective tax rate dif fers from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to earnings
taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of the California research and development ("R&D") credits, and recognition of the retroactive
reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, partially of fset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions.
        In 2015 and 2014, our U.S. income before income tax expense was $355 million and $325 million, respectively , and comprised 32% and 33%, respectively ,
of our consolidated income before income tax expense. In 2015 and 2014, the foreign income before income tax expense was $766 million and $656 million,
respectively , and comprised 68% and 67%, respectively , of our consolidated income before income tax expense.
        In 2015 and 2014, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered
our ef fective tax rate by 20% and 25%, respectively . The decrease in the foreign rate dif ferential is due to changes in foreign temporary dif ferences, as compared
to the prior -year .
        In 2014 and 2013, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered
our ef fective tax rate by 25% and 13%, respectively . The primary increase in the foreign rate dif ferential is due to the proportional increase over the prior -year's
earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at relatively lower rates. In addition, the 2014 foreign tax provision resulted in a benefit due to changes in foreign
temporary dif ferences, as compared to the prior -year .

authorities. In addition, V ivendi Games' tax return for the 2008 tax year is before the appeals function of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and is under
examination by several state taxing authorities.
        Activision Blizzard's tax years 2008 through 2014 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. The IRS is
currently examining the Company's federal tax returns for the 2008 through 201 1 tax years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transitioned the
review of its transfer pricing methodology from the advanced pricing agreement review process to the IRS examination team. Their review could result in a
different allocation of profits and losses under the Company's transfer pricing agreements. Such allocation could have a positive or negative impact on our
provision for the period in which such a determination is reached and the relevant periods thereafter . The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits
pending.
        The final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the
probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company's management, the ultimate
resolution of these matters are not expected to have a material adverse ef fect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
However , an unfavorable resolution of the Company's global tax disputes could have a material adverse ef fect on our business and results of operations in the
period in which the matters are ultimately resolved.
        The overall ef fective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction,
applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and
variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or loss. Further , the ef fective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and
could be adversely af fected by the extent that income (loss) before income tax expenses (benefit) is lower than anticipated in foreign regions where taxes are
levied at relatively lower statutory rates and/or higher than anticipated in the United States where taxes are levied at relatively higher statutory rates.
        A more detailed analysis of the dif ferences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated ef fective tax rate, as well as other information about
our income taxes, is provided in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Exchange Impact
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $242 million, a negative impact of $8 million, and a positive impact of $20 million on Activision
Blizzard's consolidated operating income in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively . The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
the euro and British pound and its impact on our foreign operating income.
        For the year ended December 31, 2014, given that the majority of the Company's GAAP net consolidated operating income is generated in the first half of
the fiscal year due to the impact of deferrals, where the euro and British pound strengthened against the U.S dollar as compared to the same period in 2013, the
negative impact from the significant weakening of the euro and British pound relative to U.S. dollar in the later stages of 2014 was lar gely of fset in on the
Company's consolidated operating income for the full year 2014.

Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)
 
Cash Flows Pr ovided by Operating Activities
        The primary drivers of cash flows provided by operating activities typically include the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of our
products and digital and subscription revenues, partially of fset by payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution and marketing of our products,
payments for customer service support for our players, payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders, payments for interest on our debt,
payments for software development, payments for tax liabilities, and payments to our workforce.
        Cash flows provided by operating activities were lower for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, driven by
the prior -year cash flows benefiting from a substantial increase in revenues which were deferred. These are partially of fset by a higher net income in 2015 as
compared to 2014 and adjustments to net income for non-cash char ges, including amortization of capitalized software development costs.
        Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 included approximately $193 million of interest paid for the Notes and
Term Loan, as compared to $201 million in 2014.
        Cash flows provided by operating activities were slightly higher for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to a more favorable impact from changes in
our working capital accounts, mainly related to cash flows from revenues which were deferred.
Cash Flows (Used in) Pr ovided by Investing Activities
        The primary drivers of cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities typically include the net ef fect of purchases and sales/maturities of short-term
investments, capital expenditures, and changes in restricted cash balances.

Table of Contents
        Cash flows used in investing activities were $3.7 billion in 2015, as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $84 million in 2014. Increased
cash flows used in investing activities were primarily due to $3.6 billion cash deposited in escrow for the King Acquisition and the cash used to acquire Major
League Gaming in the fourth quarter of 2015.
        Cash flows used in investing activities were $84 million in 2014, as compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of $308 million in 2013. Lower
cash flows from investing activities were primarily due to lower proceeds from the maturity of investments and a higher investment in capital expenditures. In
2014, proceeds from maturities were $21 million, the majority of which consisted of U.S. treasury and other government agency securities. Further , capital
expenditures during 2014, primarily related to property and equipment, were $107 million.
Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities
        The primary drivers of cash flows used in financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt, transactions
involving our common stock, such as the issuance of shares of common stock to employees, the repurchase of our common stock, and the payment of dividends.
        Cash flows used in financing activities of $135 million were lower in 2015, as compared to $374 million used in 2014, primarily due to $202 million of
proceeds received in the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase T ransaction, and the lower partial repayment of our T erm Loan in 2015 of
$250 million, as compared to the $375 million partial repayment of our T erm Loan in 2014. These were partially of fset by lower proceeds from stock options
exercised by our employees and the higher cash dividend payment made during 2015, as compared to 2014.
        Cash flows used in financing activities of $374 million were lower in 2014, as compared to $1,223 million used in 2013, primarily due to the lack of share
repurchases in 2014, of fset by the $375 million partial repayment of our T erm Loan. W e also paid $147 million in dividends and related dividend equivalents and
$66 million for taxes in connection with the vesting of employees' restricted stock rights. Cash flows from financing activities for 2014 reflected proceeds of
$175 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock to employees in connection with stock option exercises.
Effect of For eign Exchange Rate Changes
        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $366 million, a negative impact of $396 million and a positive impact of $102 million on our
cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively . The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S.
dollar relative to the euro and British pound.
Other Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
        Our primary sources of liquidity are typically cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. In addition, as
described below , we have availability of $250 million, subject to certain restrictions, under a secured revolving credit facility . With our cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2015, and expected cash flows provided by operating activities, we believe that we have suf ficient
liquidity to meet daily operations in the foreseeable future. W e also believe that we have suf ficient working capital of $0.8 billion at December 31, 2015, to
finance our operational and financing requirements for at least the next twelve months, including: purchases of inventory and equipment; the development,
production, marketing and sale of new products; provision of customer service for our players; acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from
third parties; funding of dividends; and payments related to debt obligations.

        As of December 31, 2015, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $0.5 billion, as compared to
$3.6 billion as of December 31, 2014. The decrease is due to the requirements under the T ransaction Agreement for the King Acquisition, which required us to
deposit $3.6 billion in cash to be held in an escrow account until the earlier of (i) the completion of the King Acquisition, or (ii) the termination of the T ransaction
Agreement. The cash was not accessible to the Company for operating cash needs as its use was administratively restricted for use in the consummation of the
King Acquisition. At December 31, 2015, we recorded the balance of the escrow account as a non-current asset, "Cash in escrow ," in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
        If the cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. is needed in the future for our operations in the U.S., we would accrue and pay the required U.S.
taxes to repatriate these funds. However , our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to
repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.
Debt
        On September 19, 2013, we issued, at par , $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $750 million of
6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 (the "2023 Notes" and, together with the 2021 Notes, the "Notes"). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-
annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year , commencing on March 15, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the Notes had a carrying value of
$2.2 billion.
        We may redeem the 2021 Notes on or after September 15, 2016 and the 2023 Notes on or after September 15, 2018, in whole or in part on any one or more
occasions, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time prior to September 15, 2016, with respect to the 2021 Notes, and at any
time prior to September 15, 2018, with respect to the 2023 Notes, we may also redeem some or all of the Notes by paying a "make-whole premium", plus accrued
and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of one or more qualified equity of ferings, we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount
of each of the 2021 Notes and 2023 Notes outstanding with the net cash proceeds from such of ferings. The Notes are repayable, in whole or in part and at the
option of the holders, upon the occurrence of a change in control and a ratings downgrade, at a purchase price equal to 101% of principal, plus accrued and
unpaid interest.
        On October 1 1, 2013, in connection and simultaneously with the Purchase T ransaction, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a
$2.5 billion secured term loan facility maturing in October 2020 (the "T erm Loan"), and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolver" and,
together with the T erm Loan, the "Credit Facilities"). A  portion of the Revolver can be used to issue letters of credit of up to $50 million, subject to the
availability of the Revolver . To date, we have not drawn on the Revolver .
        As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of our T erm Loan was $1.9 billion. Borrowings under the T erm Loan and Revolver bear interest at an
annual rate equal to an applicable mar gin plus, at our option, (A) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the interest rate in ef fect determined by
the administrative agent as its "prime rate," (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (c) the London InterBank Of fered Rate ("LIBOR") for an interest period of
one month plus 1.00%, or (B) LIBOR. Further , LIBOR borrowings under the T erm Loan will be subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. At December 31, 2015, the
Term Loan bore interest at 3.25%. In certain circumstances, our interest rate under the Credit Facilities will increase.
        In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal balances under the Credit Facilities, we are required to pay the lenders a commitment fee on unused
commitments under the Revolver . We are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.
69
Table of Contents
        The Credit Agreement required quarterly principal repayments of 0.25% of the T erm Loan's original principal amount, with the balance due on the maturity
date. On February 1 1, 2014, we made a voluntary principal repayment of $375 million on our T erm Loan. This repayment satisfied the required quarterly
principal repayments for the entire term of the Credit Agreement. On February 1 1, 2015, we made an additional voluntary principal repayment, this time in the
amount of $250 million, which reduced the balance due on the maturity date. The 2015 repayment reduced the T erm Loan's outstanding principal balance to
$1.9 billion and based on this reduced balance, we expect our contractual interest payments in the future will be reduced by approximately $8 million annually ,
based on the interest rate of 3.25% at December 31, 2015. Amounts borrowed under the T erm Loan and repaid may not be re-borrowed.
        Agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Agreement, impose operating and financial restrictions
on our activities under certain conditions. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In addition, the indenture and
the Credit Agreement limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt or make additional guarantees; pay distributions or dividends and
repurchase stock; make other restricted payments, including without limitation, certain restricted investments; create liens; enter into agreements that restrict
dividends from subsidiaries; engage in transactions with af filiates; and enter into mer gers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets.
        In addition, if, in the future, we borrow under the Revolver , as described in Note 1 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may be required, during certain periods where outstanding revolving loans exceed a certain threshold, to maintain a
maximum senior secured net leverage ratio calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under the Credit Agreement.
        The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Notes and Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2015.
Amendments to Cr edit Agr eement
        T ranche A Term Loan     In conjunction with the King Acquisition, the Company entered into three Amendments to the Credit Agreement (the
"Amendments"). The Amendments, among other things, provide for incremental term loans in the form of T ranche A Term Loans in an aggregate principal
amount of approximately $2.3 billion, the proceeds of which were to be issued upon successful closing to fund the King Acquisition.
        On February 23, 2016, we successfully completed the King Acquisition and the T ranche A Term Loans funded. The T ranche A Term Loans are scheduled to
mature on October 1 1, 2020 and bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the
prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the LIBOR for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or
(b) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest mar gin. LIBOR is subject to a floor of 0% and the base rate is subject to an ef fective floor of 1.00%. The
applicable interest mar gin for T ranche A Term Loans ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0.50% to 1.25% for base rate borrowings and
is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's Consolidated T otal Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
        The Amendments require quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the stated principal amount of the T ranche A Term Loans, with increases to 1.250%
starting on June 30, 2019 and 3.125% starting on June 30, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on the T ranche A Term Loans' scheduled maturity date of
October 1 1, 2020. V oluntary prepayments of the Tranche A Term Loans are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty .
70
Table of Contents
        The Tranche A Term Loans are subject to a financial maintenance covenant requiring the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated T otal Net Debt
Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.00 to 1.00, which will decrease to 3.50 to 1.00 (I) after the sixth full fiscal quarter after the T ranche A Term Loans
are made or (II) if the Collateral Suspension occurs prior to the date falling 18 months after the T ranche A Term Loans are made, on the later of (x) the last day of
the fourth full fiscal quarter after the Tranche A Term Loans are made and (y) the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the Collateral Suspension occurs.
        The Tranche A Term Loans are secured by the same collateral and guaranteed by the same guarantors that secure and guarantee the existing T erm Loans. The
other terms of the Tranche A Term Loans are also generally the same as the terms of the existing T erm Loan.
        Revolving Cr edit Facility     As part of the Amendments, upon the closing of the King Acquisition, the Company's existing revolving credit facility under the
Credit Agreement (as in ef fect prior to the closing of the King Acquisition) in an aggregate principal amount of $250 million was replaced with a new revolving
credit facility under the Credit Agreement in the same aggregate principal amount (the "2015 Revolving Credit Facility").
        Borrowings under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed by the Company and are available for working capital and
other general corporate purposes. Up to $50 million of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for letters of credit.
        The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on October 1 1, 2020. Borrowings under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the
Company's option, under the same terms as the T ranche A Term Loans. Additionally , the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the same financial
maintenance covenant and is secured by the same collateral and guaranteed by the same guarantors that secure and guarantee the T ranche A Term Loans. The
other terms of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility are generally the same as the terms of the Revolver .
Debt Repayments
        On February 2, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding debt during 2016. On February 25, 2016, we
made a voluntary principal repayment of $500 million on our T erm Loan, reducing the aggregate term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, which
includes the $2.3 billion of T ranche A Term Loans, to $3.7 billion.
Dividends
        On February 2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share, payable on May 1 1, 2016, to shareholders of record at the
close of business on March 30, 2016.
Capital Expenditur es
        We made capital expenditures of $1 11 million in 2015, as compared to $107 million in 2014. In 2016, we anticipate total capital expenditures of
approximately $155 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be primarily for computer hardware and software purchases.
Commitments
        In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our of fices, for
the development of products, and for rights to intellectual property . Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor , developer or
intellectual property holder , as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the
achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones. Further , these payments to third-
71

party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or
intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game. Additionally , in connection with certain intellectual property rights acquisitions and
development agreements, we commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be developed or in which the
intellectual property will be utilized. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual
arrangements in place at December 31, 2015 are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in millions):

(1) We have omitted uncertain income tax liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of potential issue
resolution. Specifically , either the underlying positions have not been fully developed enough under audit to quantify at this time or the
years relating to the issues for certain jurisdictions are not currently under audit. At December 31, 2015, we had $471 million of
unrecognized tax benefits, of which $453 million was included in "Other liabilities" and $18 million was included in "Accrued expenses
and other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet. 
(2) Long-term debt obligations represent our obligations related to the contractual principal repayments and interest payments under the T erm
Loan and the Notes as of December 31, 2015. There was no outstanding balance under our Revolver as of December 31, 2015. The Notes
are subject to fixed interest rates and we have calculated the interest obligation based on the applicable rates and payment dates for the
Notes. The T erm Loan bears a variable interest rate and interest is payable on a quarterly basis. W e have calculated the expected interest
obligation based on the outstanding principal balance and interest rate applicable at December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 1 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt
obligations. On February 1 1, 2015, we made a voluntary partial repayment of $250 million to the T erm Loan. The 2015 repayment
reduced our contractual interest payments, as shown in the table above, by approximately $8 million annually , through the October 2020
maturity date, based on the interest rate of 3.25% at December 31, 2015. On February 25, 2016, we made a voluntary principal repayment
of $500 million on our T erm Loan.

Financial Disclosur e
        We maintain internal control over financial reporting, which generally includes those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). W e also are focused on our "disclosure controls and
procedures," which as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that
financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules
and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial of ficers, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
        Our Disclosure Committee, which operates under the Board of Directors approved Disclosure Committee Charter and Disclosure Controls & Procedures
Policy , includes senior management representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures, as well as
in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure process. As part of our disclosure process, senior finance and operational representatives from all of our
corporate divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current-quarter operational performance, future trends, subsequent events, internal
controls, changes in internal controls and other accounting and disclosure relevant information. These quarterly reports are reviewed by certain key corporate
finance executives. These corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected quarterly reports.
The results of the quarterly reports and related interviews are reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. Finance representatives also conduct interviews with our
senior management team, our legal counsel and other appropriate personnel involved in the disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally , senior finance and
operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our periodic
public reports filed with the SEC. Financial results and other financial information also are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a
quarterly basis. As required by applicable regulatory requirements, the principal executive and financial of ficers review and make various certifications regarding
the accuracy of our periodic public reports filed with the SEC, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting. W ith the
assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we will continue to assess and monitor , and make refinements to, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal
control over financial reporting.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that af fect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could dif fer from those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed
throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies af fect our reported and expected
financial results. The estimates and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of
our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial
reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the ef fect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting
estimates and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.

Revenue Recognition including Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
        We recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product or service has been provided to the customer , the collection of our
fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date"
(which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date or the date the product
is sold to the customer .
        Certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables, which we account for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") T opic
605 and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2009-13. These revenue arrangements include product sales consisting of both software and hardware
deliverables (such as peripherals or other ancillary collectors' items sold together with physical "boxed" software) and our sales of World of W arcraft  boxed
products, expansion packs and value-added services, each of which is considered with the related subscription services for these purposes.
        Under ASC T opic 605 and ASU 2009-13, when a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or
services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy . The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor -specific-objective-
evidence ("VSOE") if it is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or best estimated selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is
available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of
accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the
arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy . If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration
allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.
        As noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP . We did not have significant revenue arrangements that require
BESP for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the actual
price char ged by the Company for a deliverable that the Company sells separately , which represents the VSOE, and the wholesale prices of the same or similar
products, which represents TPE.
        For product sales, which include the sale of physical products and digital full-game downloads, we consider the product or service to have been provided to
the customer upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers, for physical products, or when the product is available for download or is activated for
gameplay , for digital full-game downloads. Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection.
        For our software products with online functionality or that are a part of a hosted service arrangement, we evaluate whether that functionality constitutes a
more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on
(including digital downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular game constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires management's judgment. When we determine that the online functionality constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, which is principally because of the online functionality's importance to gameplay , we
consider our performance obligation for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game. VSOE of fair value does not exist for the online functionality of some
products, as we do not separately char ge for this component of every title. As a result, we initially defer all of the software-related revenues from the sale of any
such title (including digital downloadable content) and recognize the revenues ratably over the estimated service period of the title. In addition, we initially defer
the costs of sales for the title and recognize the costs
74
Table of Contents
of sales as the related revenues are recognized. The costs of sales include manufacturing costs, software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property
licenses and excludes intangible asset amortization.
        For our software products with online functionality that are considered to be incidental to the overall product of fering and are inconsequential deliverables,
we recognize the related revenues when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met.
        For our World of W arcraft  boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services, we recognize revenues in each case with the related subscription
service revenues, ratably over the estimated service period beginning upon activation of the software and delivery of the related services. Revenues attributed to
the sale of World of W arcraft  boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as "Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and
other value-added services are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."
        Certain of our games are of fered to players on a free-to-play basis. Players can purchase virtual goods, or microtransactions, to enhance their gameplay
experience. W e categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific
player action; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods represent virtual
goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time. W e recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of
time the goods are available to the player , generally the estimated service period of the game.
        We determine the estimated service period for our games with consideration of various data points, including the weighted-average number of days between
players' first and last date played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average
number of days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. W e also consider known online trends and the service periods of our previously
released games and disclosed service periods for our competitors' games that are similar in nature. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and
requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may dif fer from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated service period may change in the
future. The estimated service periods for our current games is generally less than twelve months.
Allowances for Returns, Price Pr otection, Doubtful Accounts and Inventory Obsolescence
        We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions,
and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent
reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are suf ficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to
prevent excess inventory in the channel. W e benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.
        We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer -term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and payment
terms, achievement of sell-through performance tar gets in certain instances, and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. W e may
also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors.
75
Table of Contents
        Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in
any accounting period based on estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues. W e estimate the
amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and
the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer . The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a
particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console
hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute
quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade
programs; and performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform,
seasonality , and sales strategy .
        Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However , actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our
allowance estimates due to a number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly
themed title by a competitor , or technological obsolescence due to the emer gence of new hardware platforms. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and
timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes dif ferent judgments or utilizes dif ferent estimates in
determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2015 allowance for sales returns, price protection,
and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately $3 million.
        Similarly , management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze
the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes
in our customers' payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain suf ficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of
these criteria would af fect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.
        We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels. W e write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined
primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the dif ference between the cost of the inventory and net
realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently dif ficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of loss
recognition, a new , lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase
in that newly established basis.
Softwar e Development Costs and Intellectual Pr operty Licenses
        Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for
internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined
to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and
tested product design and working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is
established. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. T echnological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-
product basis. Software development costs related to hosted service revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is
probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release,
76
Table of Contents
if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of sales—software royalties and amortization." Capitalized
costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product development expense" in the period of cancellation. Amounts
related to software development which are not capitalized are char ged immediately to "Product development expense."
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of sales—software royalties and amortization" based
on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less, or over the
estimated useful life, generally approximately one to two years.
        Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software,
technology , music or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder ,
we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in multiple products over a number of years, or alternatively , for a single product. Prior to a product's
release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of sales—intellectual property licenses."
Capitalized intellectual property costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product development expense" in the period
of cancellation.
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "Cost of sales—intellectual property licenses" based on
the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual
property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to be released over a period beyond one year , the amortization of
capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year .
        We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have
been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods,
recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is
to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable
technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated
performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based. Further , as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for
multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such
as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property , whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or
television series based on the intellectual property , and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property .
        Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised
forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be
lower than originally estimated in any given quarter , which could result in an impairment char ge. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and timing of
expenses for any period if management makes dif ferent judgments or utilizes dif ferent estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.

Income T axes
        We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC T opic 740, the provision for
income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences attributable to dif ferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary dif ferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ef fect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. W e evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . For those assets that do not
meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.
        Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,
together with the tax ef fects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be suf ficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net
deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be char ged to tax expenses in the period such
determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC T opic
740 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our
business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.
        Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves
are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be dif ferent from that which is reflected in our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. W e adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate.
To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is dif ferent than the amounts recorded, such dif ferences will impact the provision for income taxes in the
period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered
appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
        Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in foreign regions where
taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates and/or higher than anticipated in the United States where taxes are levied at relatively higher statutory rates; by
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of, or lapses in, the R&D tax credit laws; by tax ef fects of nondeductible
compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by dif ferences between amounts included in our tax filings and the estimate of such amounts
included in our tax expenses; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to
determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for
uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could
adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax
authorities. W e regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income
taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial
condition.

Fair V alue Estimates
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our
Consolidated Financial Statements. W ithout an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires
us to make several assumptions that are inherently dif ficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.
        There are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or
comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value, (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for
example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a single present amount, and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to
replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using
the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to (1) the potential future cash
flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured, (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows, (3) the time value of money
associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows, and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (that is, the risk premium).
Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently dif ficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income
approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a
significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small
change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value
assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:
        Business Combinations.     We must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Our assessment of the
estimated fair value of each of these can have a material ef fect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives.
Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is
not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset, the expected cost to
extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in-process technology . Such
estimates are inherently dif ficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements.
        Assessment of Impairment of Assets.     Management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance
with ASC Subtopic 360-10, which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment exists. W e considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-
lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to
expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for
a sustained period of time; and changes in our business strategy . In determining whether an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be
generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying values and the
undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. W e did
not record an impairment char ge to our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Table of Contents
        Financial Accounting Standards Board ("F ASB") literature related to the accounting for goodwill and other intangibles within ASC T opic 350 provides
companies an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying value before performing a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. Our reporting units are determined by the
components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both (1) discrete financial information is available and (2) segment management
regularly reviews the operating results of that component. ASC T opic 350 requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair -
value-based test. The qualitative assessment is optional. The first step measures for impairment by applying fair -value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The
second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair -value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.
        To determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments
and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating mar gins used to
calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions.
These estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market growth, our market share and costs
are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates
we are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment char ges. W e base our fair value
estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may dif fer from those estimates.
        The fair value of our reporting units is determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flow models. In determining the fair value of our
reporting units, we assumed a discount rate of approximately 10.0%. The estimated fair value of both the Activision and Blizzard reporting units exceeded their
carrying values as of December 31, 2015. However , changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future
financial performance, and changes in economic conditions could result in future impairment char ges.
        We test acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. W e have determined that no impairment
has occurred at December 31, 2015 and 2014 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of future
performance at this time. In determining the fair value of our trade names, we assumed a discount rate of 10.0%, and royalty saving rates of approximately 1.5%
—2.0%. A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would not yield an impairment char ge to our trade names. Changes in our assumptions underlying
our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment
charges.
Stock-Based Compensation
        We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC T opic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation,  and ASC Subtopic 505-50, Equity-
Based Payments to Non-Employees . Stock-based compensation expense is recognized during the requisite service periods (that is, the period for which the
employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of stock-based payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at
the time of grant and are revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates.
        We estimate the value of stock-based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial-lattice model. Our determination of fair value of stock-
based payment awards on the date of grant
80
Table of Contents
using an option-pricing model is af fected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These
variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise
behaviors.
        We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights (including restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and performance shares) based on the
closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Certain restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management vest
based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. W e estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock rights at the
closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Each quarter , we update our assessment of the probability that the specified
performance criteria will be achieved. W e amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period adjusted for
estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. W e estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant using a
Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting
tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates
into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-
based restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However , the number
of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.
        For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Recently Issued Accounting Pr onouncements
Revenue r ecognition
        In May 2014, the F ASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on
this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is
recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be ef fective beginning January 1, 2018
and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-ef fect adjustment as of the date of adoption. W e are evaluating the adoption
method as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Stock-based compensation
        In June 2014, the F ASB issued new guidance related to stock compensation. The new standard requires that a performance tar get that af fects vesting, and
that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance tar get should not be reflected in
estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes
probable that the performance tar get will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has
already been rendered. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively
to all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented as
81
Table of Contents
an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
Consolidations
        In February 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to consolidations. The new standard amends certain requirements for determining whether a
variable interest entity must be consolidated. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. W e
are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs
        In April 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new standard requires an entity to
present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be
reported as interest expense. It is ef fective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to
each prior period presented. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Internal-Use Softwar e
        In April 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to internal-use software. The new standard relates to a customer's accounting for fees paid in cloud
computing arrangements. The amendment provides guidance for customers to determine whether such arrangements include software licenses. If a cloud
arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of
other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service
contract. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of
adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Inventory
        In July 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to be
measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and
should be applied prospectively . Early adoption is permitted. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial
statements.
Business Combinations
        In September 2015, the F ASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measur ement-Period Adjustments , providing new guidance related
to business combinations. The new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment, including the impact on prior periods, made
to provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date as a result of the business combination, be recognized in the reporting period the adjustment is identified.
The standard also requires separate presentation on the face of the income statement, or disclosure in the notes, of the portion of the amount recorded in current
period earnings by line item. Prior to the issuance of the standard, such adjustments to provisional amounts were recognized retrospectively . The new standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied prospectively to
82
Table of Contents
measurement period adjustments that occur after the ef fective date. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this new accounting guidance could have a
material impact on our financial statements in future periods upon occurrence of a measurement period adjustment.
Deferr ed Taxes
        In November 2015, the F ASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferr ed Taxes, providing new guidance to simplify the presentation
of deferred taxes. The new standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the
balance sheet. The issuance of the new standard eliminates the requirement to perform the jurisdiction analysis based on the classifications of the underlying
assets and liabilities, and as a result, each jurisdiction will only have one net non-current deferred tax asset or liability . The new standard is ef fective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively . Early adoption is permitted.
        As of December 31, 2015 we early adopted ASU No. 2015-17 and applied retrospectively to all periods presented. As a result, we reclassified $368 million
of deferred tax assets from current "Deferred income taxes, net" resulting in non-current net deferred tax assets and liabilities of $264 million and $10 million,
respectively , in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014. The adoption of this new guidance did not impact our compliance with debt covenant
requirements.
Item 7A.    QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
        Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign Curr ency Exchange Rate Risk
        We transact business in many dif ferent foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary
currencies include euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won and Swedish krona. T o the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign
currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions results in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income and cash flows from
our international operations. Similarly , our revenues, operating expenses, net income and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S.
dollar weakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar , may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. W e monitor
currency volatility throughout the year .
        To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and earnings and our foreign currency risk
related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts,
principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year . The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are
large and reputable commercial or investment banks.
        We assess the nature of these derivatives under F ASB ASC T opic 815 to determine whether such derivatives should be designated as hedging instruments.
The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. W e
report the fair value of these contracts within "Other current assets," "Accrued expense and other liabilities," "Other assets," or "Other liabilities," as applicable, in
our Consolidated Balance
83
Table of Contents
Sheets based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the relevant period.
        We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
Foreign Curr ency Forwar d Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
        For foreign currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate risk from foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings that are not
designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives are recorded within "General and administrative
expenses" and "Interest and other expense, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, consistent with the nature of the underlying transactions.
        At December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was approximately
$489 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified $8 million of unrealized gains out of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)"
and into earnings due to dedesignating $250 million notional euro to U.S. dollar cash flow hedges when it was determined the hedged transaction would not
occur . As a result of the dedesignation, we entered into of fsetting foreign currency forward contracts. The dedesignated and of fsetting foreign currency forward
contracts remain outstanding as of December 31, 2015.
        The fair value of these foreign currency forward currency contracts was $1 1 million as of December 31, 2015, and recorded in "Other current assets" in our
consolidated balance sheet.
        At December 31, 2014, outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as a hedge were not material.
        For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in "General and
administrative expenses" and were not material.
Foreign Curr ency Forwar d Contracts Designated as Hedges
        For foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into to hedge forecasted intercompany cash flows that are subject to foreign currency risk, and which
have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, we assess the ef fectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing
basis and determine if the hedges are ef fective at providing of fsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company records the ef fective portion of
changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" and subsequently reclassifies the related amount of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within "General and administrative expenses" when the hedged item impacts earnings. Cash flows
from these foreign currency forward contracts are classified in the same category as the cash flows associated with the hedged item in the consolidated statements
of cash flows. W e measures hedge inef fectiveness, if any , and if it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly ef fective hedge, the Company will
discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.
        The gross notional amount of all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was approximately $381 million at
December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. These foreign
currency forward contracts have remaining maturities of 12 months or less. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was no inef fectiveness
relating to these hedges. At December 31, 2015, $4 million of net unrealized losses related to these contracts are expected to be reclassified into earnings within
the next twelve months.
84
Table of Contents
        During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, pre-tax net realized gains of $6 million and $8 million, respectively , associated with these contracts
were reclassified out of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" and into "General and administrative expense" due to maturity of these contracts.
        In the absence of the hedging activities described above, for the year ended December 31, 2015, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate
movement of 10% would have resulted in potential declines of our net income of approximately $121 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse
shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however , all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual
results may dif fer materially .
Inter est Rate Risk
        Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the Credit Facilities.
We do not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical interest rate change on our variable
rate debt of one percent (100 basis points) would change interest expense on an annual basis by approximately $19 million. Because we have a 0.75% LIBOR
floor in our T erm Loan, our interest expense will only increase if the underlying interest rate increases to a level that exceeds the LIBOR floor . This estimate does
not include the ef fects of other actions that we may take in the future to mitigate this risk or any changes in our financial structure.
        Our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities. Because
short-term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash
equivalents or short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities. Conversely , the fair value of such a portfolio
is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer -term securities. At December 31, 2015, our $1.82 billion of cash and cash equivalents were
comprised primarily of money market funds. At December 31, 2015, our $8 million of short-term investments included $8 million of restricted cash. W e also had
$9 million in auction rate securities at fair value classified as long-term investments at December 31, 2015. The Company has determined that, based on the
composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015, there was no material interest rate risk exposure to the Company's consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity as of that date.

Definition and Limitations of Disclosur e Contr ols and Pr ocedur es.
        Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
Act")) are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our
principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information
otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to,
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls
based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its
desired objectives under all possible future events.
Evaluation of Disclosur e Contr ols and Pr ocedur es.
        Our management, with the participation of our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, has evaluated the ef fectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures at December 31, 2015, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive of ficer and principal
financial of ficer concluded that, at December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were ef fective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a
timely basis, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management's Report on Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting.
        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, conducted an
evaluation of the ef fectiveness, as of December 31, 2015, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Or ganizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was ef fective as of December 31, 2015.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
        The ef fectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting.
        There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially af fected, or are
reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm 
        To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc.:
        In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows, present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
index presents fairly , in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria
established in Internal Contr ol—Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission (COSO). The
Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on
the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. W e conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
        A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation and Pr esentation
        The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company . All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that af fect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could dif fer from these estimates
and assumptions.
        Certain reclassifications have been made to prior -year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
        The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, to provide additional
evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
        We consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be "Cash and
cash equivalents."
Investment Securities
        Investments designated as available-for -sale securities are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is
estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses of the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Company's available-for -sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of "Other comprehensive income (loss)."
        Investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities of less than one year are normally classified within "Short-term
investments." In addition, investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified within "Short-term investments" if they are highly liquid in nature and
represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
        The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses reflected in "Interest and other
investment income (expense), net" in our consolidated statements of operations.
Cash in Escr ow
        As part of the King Acquisition, we were required to deposit $3.56 billion in cash to be held in an escrow account until the earlier of (i) the completion of the
King Acquisition, or (ii) the termination of the T ransaction Agreement. The cash was not accessible to the Company for operating cash needs as its use had been
administratively restricted for use in the consummation of the King Acquisition. At December 31, 2015, we recorded the balance of the escrow account as a non-
current asset, "Cash in escrow ," in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Financial Instruments
        The carrying amounts of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Accounts receivable," "Accounts payable," and "Accrued expenses" approximate fair value due to
the short-term nature of these accounts. Our investments in U.S. treasuries, government agency securities, and corporate bonds, if any , are carried at fair value,
which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar
characteristics.
        The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies,
subjecting us to foreign currency risk. T o mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and
earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter
into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year . The counterparties for
our currency derivative contracts are lar ge and reputable commercial or investment banks.
        We assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("F ASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") T opic 815 to
determine whether such derivatives should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the
prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. W e report the fair value of these contracts within "Other current assets,"
"Accrued expense and other liabilities," "Other assets," or "Other liabilities," as applicable, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the prevailing exchange
rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the relevant period.
        We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
        For foreign currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate risk from foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings that are not
designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives are recorded within "General and administrative
expenses" and "Interest and other expense, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, consistent with the nature of the underlying transactions.
        For foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into to hedge forecasted intercompany cash flows that are subject to foreign currency risk and which
have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, we assess the ef fectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing
basis and determine if the hedges are ef fective at providing of fsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company records the ef fective portion of
changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" and subsequently reclassifies the related amount of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within "General and administrative expenses" when the hedged item impacts earnings. The Company
measures hedge inef fectiveness, if any , and if it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly ef fective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge
accounting for the derivative.
Concentration of Cr edit Risk
        Our concentration of credit risk relates to depositors holding the Company's cash and cash equivalents and customers with significant accounts receivable
balances.
        Our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market funds consisting of short-term, high-quality debt instruments issued by governments
and governmental or ganizations, financial institutions and industrial companies.
        Our customer base includes retailers and distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty
stores in the U.S. and other countries worldwide. W e perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. W e
generally do not require collateral or other security from our customers. W e had two customers, Sony and Microsoft, who accounted for 12% and 10%,
respectively , of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. W e did not have any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of net revenues for the
years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013. W e had three customers, Sony , Microsoft, and W al-Mart, who accounted for 18%, 13%, and 1 1% of consolidated
gross receivables at December 31, 2015, respectively , and 13%, 17%, and 1 1% of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2014, respectively .
Softwar e Development Costs and Intellectual Pr operty Licenses
        Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for
internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined
to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and
tested product design and working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is
established. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. T echnological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-
product basis. Software development costs related to hosted service revenue arrangements

are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the
function intended. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of sales—
software royalties and amortization." Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product development
expense" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are char ged immediately to "Product development
expense."
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of sales—software royalties and amortization" based
on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less, or over the
estimated useful life, generally approximately one to two years.
        Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software,
technology , music or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder ,
we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in multiple products over a number of years, or alternatively , for a single product. Prior to a product's
release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of sales—intellectual property licenses."
Capitalized intellectual property costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are char ged to "Product development expense" in the period
of cancellation.
        Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "Cost of sales—intellectual property licenses" based on
the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual
property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to be released over a period beyond one year , the amortization of
capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year .
        We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have
been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods,
recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is
to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable
technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated
performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based. Further , as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for
multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such
as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property , whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or
television series based on the intellectual property , and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property .
        Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value
may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter , which could result in an impairment char ge. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and
timing of expenses for any period if management makes dif ferent judgments or utilizes dif ferent estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.
Inventories
        Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor , and freight-in and are stated at the lower of cost
(weighted-average method) or net realizable value. Inventories are relieved on a weighted-average cost method.
Long-Lived Assets
        Pr operty and Equipment.     Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life ( i.e., 25 to
33 years for buildings, and 2 to 5 years for computer equipment, of fice furniture and other equipment) of the asset. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost
and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs
are expensed as incurred.
        Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets.     We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC T opic 350. Under ASC T opic 350, goodwill is considered to
have an indefinite life, and is carried at cost. Acquired trade names are assessed as indefinite lived assets if there is no foreseeable limits on the periods of time
over which they are expected to contribute cash flows. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test, as
well as between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. W e perform our annual impairment testing at
December 31st.
        Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. W e have determined our reporting units based on the guidance within ASC
Subtopic 350-20. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. W e test goodwill for possible impairment by
first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair
value of our reporting units is determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flow models. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting
unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment, which is equal to the amount by which the
recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill after assessing the fair value of each of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit. W e
have determined that no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows,
which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time.
        We test indefinite lived acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. W e have determined that
no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our
best estimate of future performance at this time.

        Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic
conditions, could result in future impairment char ges.
        Amortizable Intangible Assets.     Intangible assets subject to amortization are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and amortized over the estimated
useful life in proportion to the economic benefits received.
        Management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10, which
generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. W e considered certain
events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived
intangible assets, may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; significant
changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and
changes in our business strategy . If we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from
the use and ultimate disposition of these assets to determine whether an impairment exists. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets'
carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value
of the assets. W e have determined that there are no events or circumstances that indicate a potential impairment exists at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
Revenue Recognition
        We recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product or service has been provided to the customer , the collection of our
fees is reasonably assured and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date"
(which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date or the date the product
is sold to the customer . Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with the specific
revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer , such as sales and value-added taxes.
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
        Certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables, which we account for in accordance with ASC T opic 605 and Accounting Standards Update
("ASU") 2009-13. These revenue arrangements include product sales consisting of both software and hardware deliverables (such as peripherals or other ancillary
collectors' items sold together with physical "boxed" software) and our sales of World of W arcraft  boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services,
each of which is considered with the related subscription services for these purposes.
        Under ASC T opic 605 and ASU 2009-13, when a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or
services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy . The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor -specific-objective-
evidence ("VSOE") if it is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available,
F-14
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
or best estimated selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software
deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a
group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy . If the arrangement
contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software
deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.
        As noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP . We did not have significant revenue arrangements that require
BESP for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the actual
price char ged by the Company for a deliverable that the Company sells separately , which represents the VSOE, and the wholesale prices of the same or similar
products, which represents TPE.
Product Sales
        Product sales represent sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. W e recognize revenues from the sale of our
products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers and once all performance obligations have been completed. W ith respect to digital full-game
downloads, we recognize revenues when the product is available for download or is activated for gameplay . Revenues from product sales are recognized after
deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection. Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and
product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the selling price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other
consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's national circular ad, are
reflected as sales and marketing expenses when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate
the fair value of the benefit.
Products with Online Functionality or Hosted Service Arrangements
        For our software products with online functionality or that are part of a hosted service arrangement, we evaluate whether that functionality constitutes a
more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on
(including digital downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular game constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires management's judgment. When we determine that the online functionality constitutes a more-than-
inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, which is principally because of the online functionality's importance to gameplay , we
consider our performance obligation for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game. VSOE of fair value does not exist for the online functionality of some
products, as we do not separately char ge for this component of every title. As a result, we initially defer all of the software-related revenues from the sale of any
such title (including digital downloadable content) and recognize the revenues ratably over the estimated service period of the title. In addition, we initially defer
the costs of sales for the title and recognize the costs of sales as the related revenues are recognized. The costs of sales include manufacturing costs, software
royalties and amortization, and intellectual property licenses and exclude intangible asset amortization.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
        For our software products with online functionality that we consider to be incidental to the overall product of fering and are inconsequential deliverables, we
recognize the related revenues when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met.
        For our World of W arcraft  boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services, we recognize revenues in each case with the related subscription
service revenues, ratably over the estimated service period, beginning upon the activation of the software and delivery of the related services. Revenues attributed
to the sale of World of W arcraft  boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as "Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and
other value-added services are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."
Subscription Revenues
        Subscription revenues are mostly derived from World of W arcraft . World of W arcraft  is a game that is playable through Blizzard's servers and is generally
sold on a subscription-only basis.
        For World of W arcraft , after the first month of free usage that is included with the World of W arcraft  boxed software, the World of W arcraft  end user may
enter into a subscription agreement for additional future access. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions via boxed software and prepaid subscription
cards, as well as prepaid subscriptions sales, are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the
subscription period. V alue-added service revenues associated with subscriptions are recognized ratably over the estimated service periods.
Licensing Revenues
        Third-party licensees in Russia, China and T aiwan distribute and host certain Blizzard games in their respective countries under license agreements, for
which they pay the Company a royalty . We recognize these royalties as revenues based on the end users' activation of the underlying prepaid time, if all other
performance obligations have been completed, or based on usage by the end user , when we have continuing service obligations. W e recognize any upfront
licensing fees received over the term of the contracts.
        With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenues are generally
recognized upon delivery of a master copy . Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, persuasive evidence of an
arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.
Other Revenues
        Other revenues primarily include revenues from digital downloadable content (e.g. multi-player content packs), microtransactions and the licensing of
intellectual property other than software to third-parties.
        Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from the sales of virtual
goods are initially recorded in deferred revenues. W e categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that
can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly , we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable
virtual goods represent
F-16
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time. W e recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of
time the goods are available to the player , generally the estimated service period of the game.
        Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third-parties are recorded upon the receipt of licensee statements, or upon the
receipt of cash, provided the license period has begun and all performance obligations have been completed.
Estimated Service Period
        We determine the estimated service period for our games with consideration of various data points, including the weighted average number of days between
players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average
number of days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. W e also consider known online trends and the service periods of our previously
released games and disclosed service periods for our competitors' games that are similar in nature. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and
requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may dif fer from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated service period may change in the
future. The estimated service periods for our current games is generally less than 12 months.
Allowances for Returns, Price Pr otection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence
        We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions,
and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent
reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are suf ficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to
prevent excess inventory in the channel. W e benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.
        We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer -term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and payment
terms, achievement of sell-through performance tar gets in certain instances, and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. W e may
also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors.
        Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in
any accounting period based on estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues. W e estimate the
amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and
the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer . The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a
particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the
F-17
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
franchise; console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel
inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available);
marketing trade programs; and performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other items,
genre, platform, seasonality , and sales strategy .
        Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However , actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our
allowance estimates due to a number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly
themed title by a competitor , or technological obsolescence due to the emer gence of new hardware platforms. Material dif ferences may result in the amount and
timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes dif ferent judgments or utilizes dif ferent estimates in
determining the allowances for returns and price protection.
        Similarly , management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze
the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes
in our customers' payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain suf ficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of
these criteria would af fect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.
        We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels. W e write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined
primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the dif ference between the cost of the inventory and net
realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently dif ficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss
recognition, a new , lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase
in that newly established basis.
Shipping and Handling
        Shipping and handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation char ges incurred to move finished goods to customers, are included in
"Cost of sales—product costs."
Advertising Expenses
        We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising, which are deferred and char ged to expense when the
related advertisement is run for the first time. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $523 million, $495 million, and
$401 million, respectively , and are included in "Sales and marketing expense" in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income T axes
        We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC T opic 740, the provision for
income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
F-18
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
expected future tax consequences attributable to dif ferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which the temporary dif ferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The ef fect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. W e evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability . For those assets that do
not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.
        We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. W e recognize interest
and penalties, if any , related to unrecognized tax benefits in "Income tax expense."
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
        All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in ef fect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a component of "Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity .
Earnings (Loss) Per Common Shar e
        "Basic earnings (loss) per common share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the periods presented. "Diluted earnings per share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents. Common stock
equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options. However , potential
common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such
as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.
        When we determine whether instruments granted in stock-based payment transactions are participating securities, unvested stock-based awards which
include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered to participate with common stock in undistributed earnings. W ith
participating securities, we are required to calculate basic and diluted earnings per common share amounts under the two-class method. The two-class method
excludes from the earnings per common share calculation any dividends paid or owed to participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be
attributable to participating securities.
Stock-Based Compensation
        We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC T opic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation , and ASC Subtopic 505-50, Equity-
Based Payments to Non-Employees . Stock-based compensation expense is recognized during the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the
employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of stock-based payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at
the time of grant and are revised, if necessary , in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
        We estimate the value of stock-based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial-lattice model. Our determination of fair value of stock-
based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is af fected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly
complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
        We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights (including restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and performance shares) based on the
closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Certain restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management vest
based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. W e estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock rights at the
closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Each quarter , we update our assessment of the probability that the specified
performance criteria will be achieved. W e amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period adjusted for
estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. W e estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant using a
Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting
tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates
into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-
based restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However , the number
of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

8. Goodwill
        The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (amounts in millions):
        The tax benefit credited to goodwill represents the tax deduction resulting from the exercise of stock options that were outstanding and vested at the
consummation of the Business Combination and included in the purchase price of the Company , to the extent that the tax deduction did not exceed the fair value
of those options. Conversely , to the extent that the tax deduction did exceed the fair value of those options, the tax benefit is credited to additional paid-in capital.
The addition to goodwill through acquisition is attributed to the acquisition of the business of Major League Gaming ("MLG") (see Note 23).
        At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no accumulated impairment losses.
9. Other Curr ent Assets and Curr ent Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities

        Included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" of our consolidated balance sheets are accrued payroll-related costs of $246 million and $267 million at
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively .
10. Fair V alue Measur ements
        F ASB literature regarding fair value measurements for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of "observable inputs" and minimize the use of
"unobservable inputs." The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
• Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and 
• Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities,
including certain pricing models,

Foreign Curr ency Forward Contracts
Foreign Curr ency Forwar d Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
        At December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was approximately
$489 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified $8 million of unrealized gains out of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)"
and into earnings due to dedesignating $250 million notional euro to U.S. dollar cash flow hedges when it was determined the hedged transaction would not
occur . As a result of the dedesignation, we entered into of fsetting foreign currency forward contracts. The dedesignated and of fsetting foreign currency forward
contracts remain outstanding as of December 31, 2015.
        The fair value of these foreign currency forward currency contracts was $1 1 million as of December 31, 2015, and recorded in "Other current assets" in our
consolidated balance sheet.
        At December 31, 2014, outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges were not material.
        For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in "General and

ongoing basis to determine if the hedges are ef fective at providing of fsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. W e record the ef fective portion of
changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" and subsequently reclassify the related amount of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within "General and administrative expense" when the hedged item impacts earnings. Cash flows
from these foreign currency forward contracts are classified in the same category as the cash flows associated with the hedged item in the consolidated statements
of cash flows. W e measure hedge inef fectiveness, if any , and if it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly ef fective hedge, we will discontinue
hedge accounting for the derivative.
        The gross notional amount of all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was approximately $381 million at
December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. These foreign
currency forward contracts have remaining maturities of 12 months or less. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was no inef fectiveness
relating to these hedges. At December 31, 2015, $4 million of net unrealized losses related to these contracts are expected to be reclassified into earnings within
the next twelve months.
        During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, pre-tax net realized gains of $6 million and $8 million, respectively , associated with these contracts
were reclassified out of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" and into "General and administrative expense" due to maturity of these contracts.
Fair V alue Measur ements on a Non-Recurring Basis
        We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
        For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, there were no impairment char ges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.
11. Debt
Credit Facilities
        On October 1 1, 2013, in connection and simultaneously with the Purchase T ransaction, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a
$2.5 billion secured term loan facility maturing in October 2020 (the "T erm Loan"), and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolver" and,
together with the T erm Loan, the "Credit Facilities"). A portion of the Revolver can be used to issue letters of credit of up to $50 million, subject to the
availability of the Revolver . To date, we have not drawn on the Revolver .
        Borrowings under the T erm Loan and the Revolver bear interest, payable on a quarterly basis, at an annual rate equal to an applicable mar gin plus, at our
option, (A) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the interest rate in ef fect determined by the administrative agent as its "prime rate," (b) the
federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (c) the London InterBank Of fered Rate ("LIBOR") for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (B) LIBOR. LIBOR
borrowings under the T erm Loan will be subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. At December 31, 2015, the Credit Facilities

bore interest at 3.25%. In certain circumstances, our applicable interest rate under the Credit Facilities would increase.
        In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal balances under the Credit Facilities, we are required to pay the lenders a commitment fee on unused
commitments under the Revolver . Commitment fees are recorded within "Interest and other investment income (expense), net" on the consolidated statement of
operations. W e are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees, if any , and agency fees.
        The terms of the Credit Agreement required quarterly principal repayments of 0.25% of the T erm Loan's original principal amount, with the balance due on
the maturity date. On February 1 1, 2014, we made a voluntary repayment of $375 million on our T erm Loan. This repayment satisfied the required quarterly
principal repayments for the entire term of the Credit Agreement. On February 1 1, 2015, we made an additional voluntary repayment of $250 million on our T erm
Loan.
        The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries, whose assets represent approximately 67% of our consolidated assets.
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of
liens, payment of dividends, sales of assets and mer gers and acquisitions. If our obligations under the Revolver exceed 15% of the total facility amount as of the
end of any fiscal quarter (subject to certain exclusions for letters of credit), we are also subject to certain financial covenants. A violation of any of these
covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such event of default or certain other customary events of
default, payment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated, and the lenders' commitments to extend credit under the Credit
Agreement may be terminated. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement could, under certain circumstances, permit the holders of other
outstanding unsecured debt, including the debt holders described below , to accelerate the repayment of such obligations. The Company was in compliance with
the terms of the Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2015.
Amendments to Credit Agreement
        In conjunction with the King Acquisition, the Company entered into three Amendments to the Credit Agreement (the "Amendments"). The Amendments,
among other things, provide for incremental term loans in the form of T ranche A Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.3 billion, the
proceeds of which were to be issued upon successful closing to fund the King Acquisition. On February 23, 2016, we successfully completed the King
Acquisition. Refer to Note 24 for additional information regarding the closing of the King Acquisition and impact on our debt obligations.
Unsecured Senior Notes
        On September 19, 2013, we issued, at par , $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $750 million of
6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 (the "2023 Notes" and, together with the 2021 Notes, the "Notes") in a private of fering to qualified
institutional buyers made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

        The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu  in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future senior
indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities described above. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. The Notes and related guarantees are
not secured and are ef fectively subordinated to any of the Company's existing and future indebtedness that is secured, including the Credit Facilities. The Notes
contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of liens, payment of
dividends, sales of assets and mer gers and acquisitions. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Notes as of December 31, 2015.
        Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year . As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had interest
payable of $38 million, related to the Notes, recorded within "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheet.
        We may redeem the 2021 Notes on or after September 15, 2016 and the 2023 Notes on or after September 15, 2018, in whole or in part on any one or more
occasions, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time prior to September 15, 2016, with respect to the 2021 Notes, and at any
time prior to September 15, 2018, with respect to the 2023 Notes, we may also redeem some or all of the Notes by paying a "make-whole premium", plus accrued
and unpaid interest. Upon the occurrence of one or more qualified equity of ferings, we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of each of
the 2021 Notes and 2023 Notes outstanding with the net cash proceeds from such of ferings. The Notes are repayable, in whole or in part and at the option of the
holders, upon the occurrence of a change in control and a ratings downgrade, at a purchase price equal to 101% of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
These redemption options are considered clearly and closely related to the Notes and are not accounted for separately upon issuance.
        Fees associated with the closing of the T erm Loan and the Notes are recorded as debt discount, which reduce the carrying value of the T erm Loan and the
Notes. The debt discount is amortized over the respective terms of the T erm Loan and the Notes. Amortization expense related to the debt discount is recorded
within "Interest and other expense, net" in our consolidated statement of operations.

        Our operating segments are consistent with our internal or ganizational structure, the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief
Executive Of ficer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), the manner in which we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the
availability of separate financial information. Currently , we have two reportable operating segments (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Previously , we reported "Distribution" as a reportable segment. In the current period, this was no longer deemed a reportable segment and is included
in "Other ," along with our recently announced Media Networks and Studios businesses. W e do not aggregate operating segments.
        The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our
online-enabled games, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting, and fees and other expenses
(including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals) related to acquisitions and the Purchase T ransaction. The CODM does not review any information regarding

14. Stock-Based Compensation
Activision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans
        On June 5, 2014, our shareholders approved the Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") and the 2014 Plan became ef fective. The
2014 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to provide stock-based compensation in the form of stock options, share
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the
Compensation Committee within parameters set forth in the 2014 Plan, including custom awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by
reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, shares of our common stock, or factors that may influence the value of our common stock or that are valued
based on our performance or the performance of any of our subsidiaries or business units or other factors designated by the Compensation Committee, as well as
incentive bonuses, for the purpose of providing incentives and rewards for superior performance to the directors, of ficers, employees of, and consultants to,
Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries.
        While the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our stock-based compensation program for the most part currently
utilizes a combination of options and restricted stock units. Options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a period of three to five
years, and all options expire ten years from the grant date. Restricted stock units either have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting in their entirety on an
anniversary of the date of grant, or vesting annually over a period of three to five years, or vest only if certain performance measures are met. In addition, under
the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the
award is granted, as reported on NASDAQ.
        Upon the ef fective date of the 2014 Plan, we ceased making awards under the following equity incentive plans (collectively , the "Prior Plans"), although
such plans will remain in ef fect and continue to govern outstanding awards: (i) Activision, Inc. 1998 Incentive Plan, as amended; (ii) Activision, Inc. 1999
Incentive Plan, as amended; (iii) Activision, Inc. 2001 Incentive Plan, as amended; (iv) Activision, Inc. 2002 Incentive Plan, as amended; (v) Activision, Inc. 2002
Executive Incentive Plan, as amended; (vi) Activision, Inc. 2002 Studio Employee Retention Incentive Plan, as amended; (vii) Activision, Inc. 2003 Incentive
Plan, as amended; (viii) Activision, Inc. 2007 Incentive Plan; and (ix) Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2008 Incentive Plan.
        As of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of our
common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further , increased from time to time by: (i) the number of shares relating to awards
outstanding under any Prior Plan that: (a) expire, or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (b) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or
(c) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (ii) if the exercise price of any option
outstanding under any Prior Plan is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award outstanding under any Prior Plan are, satisfied by withholding
shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the
F-34

14. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)
Company of shares already owned, the number of shares equal to the withheld or transferred shares; and (iii) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled
in shares, a number of shares equal to the dif ference between the total number of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares
actually issued or transferred. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 40 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the
2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection with awards made under the 2014 Plan are generally issued as new stock issuances.
Method and Assumptions on V aluation of Stock Options
        Our employee stock options have features that dif ferentiate them from exchange-traded options. These features include lack of transferability , early exercise,
vesting restrictions, pre- and post-vesting termination provisions, blackout dates, and time-varying inputs. A  binomial-lattice model was selected because it is
better able to explicitly address these features than closed-form models such as the Black-Scholes model, and is able to reflect expected future changes in model
inputs, including changes in volatility , during the option's contractual term.
        We have estimated expected future changes in model inputs during the option's contractual term. The inputs required by our binomial-lattice model include
expected volatility , risk-free interest rate, risk-adjusted stock return, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees'
forfeiture, exercise, and post-vesting termination behavior . Statistical methods were used to estimate employee rank-specific termination rates. These termination
rates, in turn, were used to model the number of options that are expected to vest and post-vesting termination behavior . Employee rank-specific estimates of
Expected T ime-T o-Exercise ("ETTE") were used to reflect employee exercise behavior . ETTE was estimated by using statistical procedures to first estimate the
conditional probability of exercise occurring during each time period, conditional on the option surviving to that time period and then using those probabilities to
estimate ETTE. The model was calibrated by adjusting parameters controlling exercise and post-vesting termination behavior so that the measures output by the
model matched values of these measures that were estimated from historical data.
        The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions and the weighted-average fair value at grant date using the binomial-lattice model:
        To estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we use methods that consider the implied volatility method based upon the volatilities for exchange-
traded options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility , the historical method (annualized standard deviation of the instantaneous returns on Activision
Blizzard's stock) during the option's contractual term to estimate long-term volatility , and a statistical model to estimate the transition or "mean reversion" from
short-term volatility to

long-term volatility . Based on these methods, for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2015, the expected stock price volatility ranged from
26.96% to 37.00%.
        As is the case for volatility , the risk-free rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual term. Consistent with the calculation required by a
binomial-lattice model, the risk-free rate reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next ("forward rate") as opposed to the
interest rate from the grant date to the given time period ("spot rate"). The expected dividend yield assumption for options granted during the year ended
December 31, 2015 is based on the Company's historical and expected future amount of dividend payouts.
        The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is an output
from the binomial-lattice model. The expected life of employee stock options depends on all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. A
binomial-lattice model can be viewed as assuming that employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise multiples, of
which the multiple is based on historical employee exercise behaviors.
        As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is
based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary ,
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.
Accuracy of Fair V alue Estimates
        We developed the assumptions used in the binomial-lattice model, including model inputs and measures of employees' exercise and post-vesting termination
behavior . Our ability to accurately estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability
to accurately forecast model inputs as long as ten years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility , risk-free rate,
dividend yield, and employee termination rates. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, the estimates that
are produced by this model may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller . Unfortunately , it is dif ficult to determine
if this is the case, as markets do not currently exist that permit the active trading of employee stock option and other stock-based instruments.

Stock Option Activities
        Stock option activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 are as follows (amounts in millions, except number of shares, which are in thousands, and per
share amounts):
        The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e. the dif ference between our closing stock price on the last
trading day of the period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the exercise price is below the closing stock price) that would have
been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that date. This amount changes based on the market value of our stock. The
total intrinsic value of options actually exercised was $125 million, $1 17 million, and $104 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively . The total grant date fair value of options vested was $19 million, $19 million, and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively .
        At December 31, 2015, $43 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.53 years.
Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock A wards Activities
        We grant restricted stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock, and restricted stock awards, which are issued and
outstanding upon grant but subject to the risk of forfeiture (collectively referred to as "restricted stock rights"). V esting for restricted stock rights is contingent
upon the holders' continued employment with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). Also,
certain of our performance-vesting restricted stock rights include a range of shares that may be released at vesting which are above or below the tar geted number
of restricted stock rights based on actual performance relative to the grant date performance measure. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested restricted
stock rights will be forfeited. Holders of restricted stock are restricted from selling the shares until they vest. Upon vesting of restricted stock rights, we may
withhold shares otherwise deliverable to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements.

        At December 31, 2015, approximately $39 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock rights and is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.14 years. Of the total unrecognized compensation cost, $17 million was related to performance-vesting restricted
stock rights, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.28 years. The total grant date fair value of vested restricted stock rights was
$93 million, $92 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively .
        The income tax benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock rights was $109 million, $89 million, and $77 million for the years ended

        Certain of our performance-vesting restricted stock rights do not have an accounting grant date as of December 31, 2015, as there is not a mutual
understanding between the Company and the employee of the performance terms. Generally , these performance terms relate to revenue and operating income
performance for future years where the performance goals have not yet been set. As of December 31, 2015, there were 3.4 million performance-vesting restricted
stock rights for which the accounting grant date has not been set.

        The Company's tax rate is af fected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction,
and the jurisdictions with a statutory tax rate less than the U.S. rate of 35%.
        For the year ended December , 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1,121 million, $981 million, and
$1,319 million, respectively , and our income tax expense was $229 million (or a 20% ef fective tax rate), $146 million (or a 15% ef fective tax rate), and
$309 million (or a 23% ef fective tax rate), respectively . Overall, our ef fective tax rate dif fers from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to earnings
taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of the California research and development ("R&D") credits, and recognition of the retroactive
reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, partially of fset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions.
        In connection with the Purchase T ransaction, we assumed certain tax attributes of New VH, which generally consist of New VH's net operating loss ("NOL")
carryforwards of approximately $760 million, which represent a potential future tax benefit of approximately $266 million. The utilization of such NOL
carryforwards will be subject to certain annual limitations and will begin to expire in 2021. The Company also obtained indemnification from V ivendi against
losses attributable to the disallowance of claimed utilization of such NOL carryforwards of up to $200 million in unrealized tax benefits in the aggregate, limited
to taxable years ending on or prior to December 31, 2016. No benefit for these tax attributes or indemnification was recorded upon the close of the Purchase
Transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we utilized $180 million and $148 million, respectively , of the NOL, which resulted in benefits of
$63 million and $52 million, respectively . The benefits for the year ended December 31, 2015, were reduced by $5 million for return to provision adjustments
recorded. As of December 31, 2015, and 2014, a corresponding reserve of $58 million and $52 million, respectively , were established. As of December 31, 2015,
an indemnification asset of $125 million has been recorded in "Other Assets", and, correspondingly , the same amount has been recorded as a reduction to the
consideration paid for the shares repurchased in "T reasury Stock" (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details about the share
repurchase).

        Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax ef fects of temporary dif ferences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows (amounts in millions):
        As of December 31, 2015, we have gross tax credit carryforwards of $40 million and $1 19 million for federal and state purposes, respectively , which begin
to expire in fiscal 2025. The tax credit carryforwards are presented in "Deferred tax assets" net of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of
uncertain tax positions. Through our foreign operations, we have approximately $36 million in NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2015, attributed mainly to
losses in France and Ireland, the majority of which can be carried forward indefinitely .
        We evaluate our deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and tax credits, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. W e assess whether a
valuation allowance should be established or released based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard. Realization of
the U.S. deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of suf ficient taxable income. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to
evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the
U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there are no valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.

        Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $4,084 million at December 31,
2015. Deferred income taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration. Determination of the
unrecognized deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings is not practicable because of the complexity of the hypothetical calculation. In the event of a
distribution of these earnings to the U.S. in the form of a dividend, we may be subject to both foreign withholding taxes and U.S. income taxes net of allowable
foreign tax credits.
        Vivendi Games results for the period January 1, 2008 through July 9, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign state and local income
tax returns filed by V ivendi or its af filiates while V ivendi Games results for the period from July 10, 2008 through December 31, 2008 are included in the
consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local income tax returns filed by Activision Blizzard. V ivendi Games tax year 2008 remains open to
examination by the major taxing authorities. In addition, V ivendi Games' tax return for the 2008 tax year is before the appeals function of the IRS and is under
examination by several state taxing authorities.
        Activision Blizzard's tax years 2008 through 2014 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. The IRS is
currently examining the Company's federal tax returns for the 2008 through 201 1 tax years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transitioned the
review of its transfer pricing methodology from the advanced pricing agreement review process to the IRS examination team. Their review could result in a
different allocation of profits and losses under the Company's transfer pricing agreements. Such allocation could have a positive or negative impact on our
provision for the period in which such a determination is reached and the relevant periods thereafter . The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits
pending.
        As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $552 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $529 million would af fect our ef fective tax rate
if recognized. A reconciliation of total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is as follows (amounts in
millions):
        We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in "Income tax expense". As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately
$41 million and $18 million, respectively , of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and
2013, we recorded $10 million, $5 million, and $2 million, respectively , of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions.

        Based on the current status with the IRS, there is insuf ficient information to identify any significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve
months. However , the Company may recognize a benefit of up to approximately $18 million related to the settlement of tax audits and/or the expiration of statutes
of limitations in the next twelve months.
        Although the final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes, audits, or any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority is uncertain, based on
current information, in the opinion of the Company's management, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse ef fect on the
Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However , any settlement or resolution of the Company's global tax disputes, audits,
or any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material favorable or unfavorable ef fect on our business and results of operations in the
period in which the matters are ultimately resolved.
16. Computation of Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Common Shar e
        The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in millions, except per share data):
        Certain of our unvested restricted stock rights (including certain restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and performance shares) met the definition of
participating securities based on their rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Therefore, we are required to use the two-class method in our computation of
basic and diluted earnings per common share. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, on a weighted-average basis, we had outstanding unvested
restricted stock rights with respect to 8 million and 15 million shares of common stock that are participating in earnings, respectively .

16. Computation of Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Common Shar e (Continued)
        Certain of our employee-related restricted stock rights are contingently issuable upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance measures. These shares are
included in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end of the reporting period. Approximately
3 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 as their respective performance measures
have not been met. Approximately 4 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 as
their respective performance measures have not been met.
        Potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would
be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded. Therefore, options to acquire 1 million, 2 million, and 5 million shares of common stock were
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively , as the ef fect of their
inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

to 2013.
17. Capital T ransactions
Stock Pur chase Agr eement
        On October 1 1, 2013, as described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the Purchase Transaction, repurchasing
approximately 429 million shares of our common stock for a cash payment of $5.83 billion, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement (refer to
Note 1 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financing details of the Purchase T ransaction). The repurchased shares were recorded in "T reasury
Stock" in our consolidated balance sheet.
Repur chase Pr ograms

stock during the two-year period from February 9, 2015 through February 8, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were no repurchases pursuant
to this stock repurchase program.
Dividend
        On February 2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share, payable on May 1 1, 2016, to shareholders of record at the

19. Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Cr edit
        As described in Note 1 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, a portion of our Revolver can be used to issue letters of credit of up to
$50 million, subject to the availability of the Revolver . At December 31, 2015, we did not have any letters of credit issued under the Revolver .
        We maintain two irrevocable standby letters of credit, which are required by one of our inventory manufacturers so that we can qualify for certain payment
terms on our inventory purchases. Our standby letters of credit were for $8 million and 3 million euros ($3 million) at December 31, 2015, and $10 million and
1 million euros ($1 million) at December 31, 2014. For the standby letter of credit denominated in U.S. dollars, under the terms of the arrangements, we are
required to maintain a compensating balance on deposit with a bank, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the available amount of the letter of credit
plus the aggregate amount of any drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder , but not reimbursed. Both letters of credit were undrawn at
December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Commitments
        In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our of fices, for
the development of products and for the rights to intellectual property . Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor , developer or
intellectual property holder , as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the
achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones. Further , these payments to third-party developers and intellectual property
holders typically are deemed to be advances and, as such, are

for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2015 are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in millions):
Legal Pr oceedings
        We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims. SEC regulations govern disclosure of legal proceedings in periodic reports and F ASB ASC T opic
450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. W e record an accrual for a potential
loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is within
a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount
within the range. Moreover , even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible
(i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse impacts on us.
        The outcomes of legal proceedings and other claims are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. There is significant
judgment required in the analysis of these matters, including the probability determination and whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In
making these determinations, we, in consultation with outside counsel, examine the

matters are inherently unpredictable and the timing of development of factors on which reasonable judgments and estimates can be based can be slow . As such,
there can be no assurance that the final outcome of any legal matter will not materially and adversely af fect our business, financial condition, results of
operations, profitability , cash flows or liquidity .
Purchase T ransaction Matters
        In prior periods, the Company reported on litigation related to the Purchase T ransaction. During the period ended June 30, 2015, the cases were resolved and
dismissed with prejudice. As part of the resolution of the claims, we received a settlement payment of $202 million in July 2015 from V ivendi, ASAC, and our
insurers. W e recorded the settlement within "Shareholders' equity" in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
Other Matters
        In addition, we are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including with
respect to intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance
matters, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we
do not expect them to have a material adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity .
20. Related Party T ransactions
Transactions with V ivendi and Its Affiliates
        As part of the Business Combination in 2008, we entered into various transactions and agreements, including cash management services agreements, a tax
sharing agreement and an investor agreement, with V ivendi and its subsidiaries. In connection with the consummation of the Purchase T ransaction, we terminated
the cash management arrangements with V ivendi and amended our investor agreement with V ivendi. W e are also party to a number of agreements with
subsidiaries and other af filiates of V ivendi, including music licensing and distribution arrangements and promotional arrangements, none of which were impacted
by the Purchase T ransaction. None of these services, transactions, and agreements with V ivendi and its af filiates were material, either individually or in the
aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on May 28, 2014,
Vivendi sold 41 million shares, reducing its ownership interest below 10%, and is no longer considered a related party . Subsequent to December 31, 2015,
Vivendi sold their remaining shares of our common stock.
Transactions with ASAC's Affiliates
        Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company and each of Mr . Kotick, the Company's Chief Executive Of ficer, and Mr . Kelly , the Company's
Chairman of the board of directors, entered into a waiver and acknowledgement letters (together , the "W aivers"), which provide, among other things, (i) that the

current and future grants, awards, benefits or entitlements) in connection with or as a consequence of the T ransactions.
        Also pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, on October 1 1, 2013, we, ASAC and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly
entered into the Stockholders Agreement. The Stockholders Agreement contains various agreements among the parties regarding voting rights, transfer rights, and
a standstill agreement, among other things. In connection with the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase T ransaction, the parties to the Stockholders
Agreement amended that agreement on May 28, 2015.
21. Recently Issued Accounting Pr onouncements
Revenue r ecognition
        In May 2014, the F ASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on
this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is
recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be ef fective beginning January 1, 2018
and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-ef fect adjustment as of the date of adoption. W e are evaluating the adoption
method as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Stock-based compensation
        In June 2014, the F ASB issued new guidance related to stock compensation. The new standard requires that a performance tar get that af fects vesting, and
that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance tar get should not be reflected in
estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes
probable that the performance tar get will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has
already been rendered. The new standard is ef fective for
F-49

fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the
earliest annual period presented as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Early adoption is permitted. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this
new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Consolidations
        In February 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to consolidations. The new standard amends certain requirements for determining whether a
variable interest entity must be consolidated. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. W e
are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs
        In April 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new standard requires an entity to
present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be
reported as interest expense. It is ef fective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to
each prior period presented. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Internal-Use Softwar e
        In April 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to internal-use software. The new standard relates to a customer's accounting for fees paid in cloud
computing arrangements. The amendment provides guidance for customers to determine whether such arrangements include software licenses. If a cloud
arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of
other software licenses and account for the non-software element as a service contract. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the
customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early
adoption is permitted. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
Inventory
        In July 2015, the F ASB issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to be
measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The new standard is ef fective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and
should be applied prospectively . Early adoption is permitted. W e are evaluating the impact, if any , of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial
statements.

Business Combinations
        In September 2015, the F ASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measur ement-Period Adjustments , providing new guidance related
to business combinations. The new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment, including the impact on prior periods, made
to provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date as a result of the business combination, be recognized in the reporting period the adjustment is identified.
The standard also requires separate presentation on the face of the income statement, or disclosure in the notes, of the portion of the amount recorded in current
period earnings by line item. Prior to the issuance of the standard, such adjustments to provisional amounts were recognized retrospectively . The new standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the ef fective
date. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements in future periods upon
occurrence of a measurement period adjustment.
Deferr ed Taxes
        In November 2015, the F ASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferr ed Taxes, providing new guidance to simplify the presentation
of deferred taxes. The new standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the
balance sheet. The issuance of the new standard eliminates the requirement to perform the jurisdiction analysis based on the classifications of the underlying
assets and liabilities, and as a result, each jurisdiction will only have one net non-current deferred tax asset or liability . The new standard is ef fective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively . Early adoption is permitted.
        As of December 31, 2015 we early adopted ASU No. 2015-17 and applied retrospectively to all periods presented. As a result, we reclassified $368 million
of deferred tax assets from current "Deferred income taxes, net" resulting in non-current net deferred tax assets and liabilities of $264 million and $10 million,

23. Acquisitions
Major League Gaming
        On December 22, 2015, we acquired the business of Major League Gaming, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $46 million in cash. MLG is a leader in
creating and streaming premium live gaming events, or ganizing professional competitions and running competitive gaming leagues. MLG's business will operate
under our Media Networks operating segment.
        We identified and recorded the assets acquired at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, and allocated the remaining value of $12 million to
goodwill. The goodwill recorded is expected to be tax deductible for tax purposes. The primary intangible asset acquired relates to the developed technology . The
values assigned to the acquired assets were preliminary estimates of fair value available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may be adjusted
as further information becomes available during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of the acquisition. The primary areas of the preliminary
purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized due to information that may become available subsequently include any changes in these fair values which
could potentially result in adjustments to goodwill. The individual tangible and intangible assets acquired in the acquisition were immaterial to the Company's
consolidated financial statements. W e did not assume any significant liabilities as part of the acquisition.
        The following net assets were recognized resulting from the acquisitions:
        Pro forma financial information has not been presented as the acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2015.

24. Subsequent Events
The King Acquisition
        On November 2, 2015, we and King entered into a T ransaction Agreement under the terms of which we would acquire King and King would become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company . On February 23, 2016 we completed the King Acquisition under the terms of the T ransaction Agreement. W e
transferred $5.9 billion in consideration to the existing King shareholders and share-based award holders.
        The Company made this acquisition because it believes that the addition of King's highly-complementary mobile business will position the Company as a
global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console and PC platforms, and positions the company for future growth. The combined company has a
world-class interactive entertainment portfolio of top-performing franchises.
        As the closing of the King Acquisition occurred subsequent to December 31, 2015, our financial results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 do
not contain the results of King.
        The purchase price, including replacement share awards, is made up of the net assets acquired, including tangible assets, trademark, franchises, developed
technology , other intangibles, and goodwill. A portion of the goodwill associated with this purchase is expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
Due to the timing of the close of the King Acquisition, we did not have suf ficient time to complete the valuation of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities,
and therefore, the purchase price allocation and amount of goodwill and the tax deduction cannot be determined at this time. Additionally , supplemental pro
forma information has not been provided for King as due to the timing of the closing of the King Acquisition, compilation of such data is impracticable.
Credit Facilities
        T ranche A Term Loan     In connection with the closing of the King Acquisition, the Company was provided with incremental term loans, in the form of
Tranche A Term Loans, in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.3 billion, of which the proceeds were used to fund the King Acquisition.
        The Tranche A Term Loans are scheduled to mature on October 1 1, 2020 and bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the
highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the LIBOR for an interest period of one
month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (b) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest mar gin. LIBOR is subject to a floor of 0% and the base rate is
subject to an ef fective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest mar gin for T ranche A Term Loans ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings and from
0.50% to 1.25% for base rate borrowings and is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's Consolidated T otal Net Debt Ratio (as defined
in the Credit Agreement).
        The Tranche A Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the stated principal amount of the T ranche A Term Loans, with increases to
1.250% starting on June 30, 2019 and 3.125% starting on June 30, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on the T ranche A Term Loans' scheduled maturity
date of October 1 1, 2020. V oluntary prepayments of the T ranche A Term Loans are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts, without premium or
penalty .

24. Subsequent Events (Continued)
        The Tranche A Term Loans are subject to a financial maintenance covenant requiring the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated T otal Net Debt
Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.00 to 1.00, which will decrease to 3.50 to 1.00 (I) after the sixth full fiscal quarter after the T ranche A Term Loans
are made or (II) if the Collateral Suspension occurs prior to the date falling 18 months after the T ranche A Term Loans are made, on the later of (x) the last day of
the fourth full fiscal quarter after the Tranche A Term Loans are made and (y) the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the Collateral Suspension occurs.
        The Tranche A Term Loans are secured by the same collateral and guaranteed by the same guarantors that secure and guarantee the existing T erm Loans. The
other terms of the Tranche A Term Loans are also generally the same as the terms of the existing T erm Loan.
        Revolving Cr edit Facility     As part of the Amendments, upon the closing of the King Acquisition, the Company's existing revolving credit facility under the
Credit Agreement (as in ef fect prior to the closing of the King Acquisition) in an aggregate principal amount of $250 million was replaced with a new revolving
credit facility under the Credit Agreement in the same aggregate principal amount (the "2015 Revolving Credit Facility").
        Borrowings under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed by the Company and are available for working capital and
other general corporate purposes. Up to $50 million of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for letters of credit.
        The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on October 1 1, 2020. Borrowings under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the
Company's option, under the same terms as the T ranche A Term Loans. Additionally , the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the same financial
maintenance covenant and is secured by the same collateral and guaranteed by the same guarantors that secure and guarantee the T ranche A Term Loans. The
other terms of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility are generally the same as the terms of the Revolver .
Debt Repayments
        On February 2, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding debt during 2016. On February 25, 2016, we
made a voluntary principal repayment of $500 million on our T erm Loan, reducing the aggregate term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, which
includes the $2.3 billion of T ranche A Term Loans, to $3.7 billion. Since this repayment was not a contractual requirement and was not authorized by the Board
of Directors until February 2016, we did not reflect the repayment as a "Current portion of long-term debt" in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2015.

exercised during the Holder’s lifetime only by the Holder or, in the event of the Holder’s legal incapacity to do so, by the Holder’s guardian or legal
representative acting on behalf of the Holder in a fiduciary capacity under court supervision and/or applicable law.
 
(c)           Procedure for Exercise.  The Stock Option may be exercised by the Holder as to all or any of the Shares as to which the Stock
Option has vested (i) by following the procedures for exercise established by the Equity Account Administrator and posted on the Equity Account
Administrator’s website from time to time or (ii) with the Company’s consent, by giving the Company written notice of exercise, in such form as may be
prescribed by the Company from time to time, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased.
 
A-3
 
(d)           Payment of Exercise Price.  To be valid, any exercise of the Stock Option must be accompanied by full payment of the aggregate
Exercise Price of the Shares being purchased.  The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to make such payment, which may
include any of the following:  (i) by bank check or certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, (ii) if securities of the Company of the
same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the
Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to
sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such exercise and to thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an
amount in cash equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Shares being purchased, (iii) by tendering previously owned shares (valued at their Market Value
per Share as of the date of tender), (iv) through the withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise, or (v) any combination of (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv) above or any other manner permitted pursuant to the Plan.
 
(e)           No Fractional Shares.  In no event may the Stock Option be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
(f)            No Adjustment for Dividends or Other Rights.  No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the
record date is prior to the date as of which the issuance or transfer of Shares to the person entitled thereto has been evidenced on the books and records of the
Company pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 3(g) hereof following exercise of the Stock Option.
 
(g)           Issuance and Delivery of Shares.  As soon as practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) after the valid exercise of the Stock
Option, the Company shall (i) effect the issuance or transfer of the Shares purchased upon such exercise, (ii) cause the issuance or transfer of such Shares to
be evidenced on the books and records of the Company, and (iii) cause such Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of
the person entitled to such Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided, however,
that, in the event such Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 15 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate evidencing such Shares
and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
(h)           Partial Exercise.  If the Stock Option shall have been exercised with respect to less than all of the Shares purchasable upon
exercise of the Stock Option, the Company shall make a notation in its books and records to reflect the partial exercise of the Stock Option and the number of
Shares that thereafter remain available for purchase upon exercise of the Stock Option.
 
4.             Termination of Employment.
 
(a)           Cause.  In the event that the Holder’s employment is terminated by any entity in the Company Group for Cause, as of the date of
such termination of employment the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest, if not then fully vested, (ii) no longer be exercisable, whether or not vested, and
(iii) be immediately cancelled.
 
A-4
 
(b)           Death or Disability. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder dies while employed by any entity in
the Company Group or the Holder’s employment with any entity in the Company Group is terminated due to the Holder’s Disability, the Stock Option shall
(i) cease to vest as of the date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability (as determined by the Committee), as the case may be, and
(ii) to the extent vested as of the date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability, as the case may be, remain exercisable in accordance
with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the date of the Holder’s death or termination of employment, as the case may be, and
(B) the Expiration Date, after which the Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable and shall be immediately cancelled.  To the extent not vested as of the
date of the Holder’s death or the first date of the Holder’s Disability, as the case may be, the Stock Option shall be immediately cancelled and shall no longer
be exercisable.
 
(c)           Other.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that the Holder’s employment is terminated for any reason not
addressed by Section 4(a) or 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall (i) cease to vest as of the date of such termination of employment and (ii) to the extent vested
as of the date of such termination of employment, be exercisable in accordance with these Award Terms until the earlier of (A) the 30th day after the date of
such termination of employment (or, if the Holder is prohibited from exercising the Stock Option during some or all of the 30-day period following such
termination date because such exercise would not be in compliance with the Exercise Rules and Regulations, whatever later date may be determined in
accordance with a Committee-approved policy) and (B) the Expiration Date, after which the Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable and shall be
immediately cancelled.  To the extent not vested as of the date of such termination of service, the Stock Option shall be immediately cancelled and shall no
longer be exercisable.
 
5.             Tax Withholding.  The Company shall have the right to require the Holder to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the exercise (in
whole or in part) of the Stock Option, the issuance or transfer of any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option or otherwise in connection with the Award at
the time such Withholding Taxes become due.  The Company shall determine the method or methods the Holder may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes
contemplated by this Section 5, which may include any of the following:  (a) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire transfer
of immediately available funds; (b) if securities of the Company of the same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted on a national securities exchange,
the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of
irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, to the Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent, such other
brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to sell some or all of the Shares being purchased upon such exercise and to
thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of such Withholding Taxes;
(c) by tendering previously owned shares (valued at their Market Value per Share as of the date of tender); (d) through the withholding of Shares otherwise
deliverable upon exercise; or (e) by any combination of (a), (b), (c) or (d) above.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any entity in the
Company Group shall have the right to ensure that all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 are satisfied by (i) withholding from the Holder’s
compensation, (ii) withholding Shares otherwise then deliverable (in which case the Holder will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares
purchased upon exercise of the Stock
 
A-5
 
Option), and (iii) arranging for the sale, on the Holder’s behalf, of Shares otherwise then deliverable.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver any
Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option unless and until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 5 have been satisfied.
 
6.             Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, the Holder is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan,
the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
7.             Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon exercise of the Stock Option such number of
Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon exercise thereof.
 
8.             Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the
generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant
or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the
rights of the Holder taken as a whole without the Holder’s consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may
amend the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 9 hereof)
affecting any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of
the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to
prevent the Award from becoming subject to Section 409A.
 
9.             Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 13 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Holder that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
10.          Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Stock Option may not be exercised, and the Stock
Option and Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Stock Option may not be purchased, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged,
 
A-6
 
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The
Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, the Stock Option or Shares with the SEC,
any state securities commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such compliance.  The Holder
shall make such representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-existence of
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the Stock Option or Shares, to issue or transfer the Stock Option or Shares in
compliance with the provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The Company shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to register the issuance or resale of the Stock Option or Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or
applicable state securities law.
 
11.          Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and only with the Company’s consent, the Holder may transfer all or part of the Stock
Option for estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that any transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in
connection with such transfer; and provided further that the Holder will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these
Award Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 11, the Stock Option shall not be transferable by the Holder other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution.
 
12.          Employment Violation.  The terms of this Section 12 shall apply to the Stock Option if the Holder is or becomes subject to an employment
agreement with any entity in the Company Group.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the termination
and cancellation of the Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, and (b) payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to
such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of payment by the Holder to the Company of the Recapture Amount, the Holder, in his or her
discretion, may tender to the Company the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option during the Look-back Period with respect to such Employment
Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such termination of the Stock Option and payment of the Recapture
Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy available to the Company arising out of or in connection with
such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate the Holder’s employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive
relief and additional monetary damages.
 
13.          Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)           The Holder is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to the Holder in connection
with the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)           The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by the Holder in connection with the
 
A-7
 
Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain Financial Restatements.
 
14.          Section 409A.  As the Exercise Price is equal to the fair market value of a Share on the Date of Grant, payments contemplated with respect
to the Award are intended to be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and
interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (b) if any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the
imposition on the Holder or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of
the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of the Holder, in the manner that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith
determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties; provided, however, that this Section 13 does not create an
obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or
gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by the Holder pursuant to Section 409A.
 
15.          Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Shares to
bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’),
OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
16.          No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be construed to confer upon the
Holder any right to be continued in the employ of any entity in the Company Group or derogate from any right of any entity in the Company Group to retire,
request the resignation of, or discharge the Holder at any time, with or without Cause.
 
17.          No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of the Stock Option shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any right
of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable against
the Company except to the extent set forth, in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
18.          Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
A-8
 
19.          Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)           For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Stock Option or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation
shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of California, and no
other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Stock Option is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)           To the extent that federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the Grant
Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
20.          Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and the Holder and, to the extent applicable, the Holder’s permitted assigns under Section 3(b) hereof and the Holder’s
estate or beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
21.          Notices.
 
(a)           Any notice or other document which the Holder may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other
address as the Company by notice to the Holder may designate in writing from time to time.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
(b)           Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to the Holder pursuant to or in
connection with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier,
addressed to the Holder at the address shown on any employment agreement or offer letter between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect
at the time, or such other address as the Holder by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole
discretion, deliver any such document to the Holder electronically via an e-mail to the Holder at his or her Company-provided email address or through a
notice delivered to such e-mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party
designated by the Company, including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
A-9
 
22.          Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, the terms of the Grant
Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between the Holder and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and the terms of the Plan, the terms of
the Plan shall control.
 
23.          Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Holder’s participation in the Plan,
on the Stock Option and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to facilitate the
administration of the Plan, and to require the Holder to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
24.          Waiver.  The Holder acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by the Holder or any other holder of an equity award from
the Company.

2.             Vesting.  Except as otherwise set forth in these Award Terms, the Restricted Share Units shall vest in accordance with the “Schedule for
Vesting” set forth on the Grant Notice.  Each Restricted Share Unit, upon vesting thereof, shall entitle the holder thereof to receive one Common Share
(subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 10 hereof).
 
3.             Termination of Employment.
 
(a)           Cause.  In the event that Grantee’s employment is terminated by any entity in the Company Group for Cause, as of the date of
such termination of employment all Restricted Share Units shall cease to vest and any outstanding Restricted Share Units and Vested Shares that have yet to
settle pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall immediately be forfeited to the Company without payment of consideration by the Company.
 
(b)           Other.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that Grantee’s employment is terminated for any reason other
than for Cause, as of the date of such termination of employment all Restricted Share Units shall cease to vest and, with the exception of any Vested Shares
that have yet to settle pursuant to Section 8 hereof, shall immediately be forfeited to the Company without payment of consideration by the Company.
 
4.             Tax Withholding.  The Company shall have the right to require Grantee to satisfy any Withholding Taxes resulting from the vesting of any
Restricted Share Units, the issuance or transfer of any Vested Shares or otherwise in connection with the Award at the time such Withholding Taxes become
due.  The Company shall determine the method or methods Grantee may use to satisfy any Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 4, which may
include
 
A-3
 
any of the following:  (a) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds; (b) through the
delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the Company, that the Company withhold Vested Shares otherwise then deliverable having
a value equal to the aggregate amount of the Withholding Taxes (valued in the same manner used in computing the amount of such Withholding Taxes); (c) if
securities of the Company of the same class as the Vested Shares are then traded or quoted on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or
a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a
form acceptable to the Company, to the Equity Account Administrator (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage firm as may be requested by the
Grantee) to sell some or all of the Vested Shares and to thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an amount in cash equal to
the aggregate amount of such Withholding Taxes; or (d) by any combination of (a), (b) and (c) above.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any entity in the Company Group shall have the right to ensure that all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 4 are satisfied by
(i) withholding from Grantee’s compensation, (ii) withholding Vested Shares otherwise then deliverable (in which case Grantee will be deemed to have been
issued the full number of Vested Shares), and (iii) arranging for the sale, on Grantee’s behalf, of Vested Shares otherwise then deliverable.  The Company
shall have no obligation to deliver any Vested Shares unless and until all Withholding Taxes contemplated by this Section 4 have been satisfied.
 
5.             Deemed Agreement.  By accepting the Award, Grantee is deemed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms.
 
6.             Reservation of Shares.  The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance or delivery upon vesting of the Restricted Share Units such
number of Common Shares as shall be required for issuance or delivery upon vesting thereof.
 
7.             Dividend Equivalents.  The holder of the Restricted Share Units shall not be entitled to receive any payment, payment-in-kind or any
equivalent with regard to any cash or other dividends that are declared and paid on Common Shares.
 
8.             Receipt and Delivery.  As soon as administratively practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) after any Restricted Share Units vest, the
Company shall (a) effect the issuance or transfer of the resulting Vested Shares, (b) cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to be evidenced on
the books and records of the Company, and (c) cause such Vested Shares to be delivered to a Company-Sponsored Equity Account in the name of the person
entitled to such Vested Shares (or, with the Company’s consent, such other brokerage account as may be requested by such person); provided, however, that,
in the event such Vested Shares are subject to a legend as set forth in Section 16 hereof, the Company shall instead cause a certificate evidencing such Vested
Shares and bearing such legend to be delivered to the person entitled thereto.
 
9.             Committee Discretion.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the Committee shall have sole discretion to (a) interpret any
provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and the
Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights of the Company
 
A-4
 
under the Award, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, any decision or determination
to be made by the Committee pursuant to these Award Terms, including whether to grant or withhold any consent, shall be made by the Committee in its sole
and absolute discretion, subject only to the terms of the Plan.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award
prospectively or retroactively; however, no such amendment may materially and adversely affect the rights of Grantee taken as a whole without Grantee’s
consent.  Without intending to limit the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Committee may amend the terms of the Award (i) in recognition of unusual
or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in Section 10 hereof) affecting any entity in the Company Group or any of the
Company’s other affiliates or the financial statements of any entity in the Company Group or any of the Company’s other affiliates, (ii) in response to changes
in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and interpretations thereof, or (iii) to prevent the Award from becoming subject to any adverse
consequences under Section 409A.
 
10.          Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee will make or
provide for such adjustments to the Award as are equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Grantee that otherwise would result
from (a) any stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the
Company, (b) any change of control, merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other
distribution of assets, or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of
the foregoing.  Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for the Award such
alternative consideration (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as it may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection
therewith the surrender of the Award.
 
11.          Registration and Listing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or
transfer any Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares, and no Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of or encumbered in any way, unless such transaction is in compliance with all Exercise Rules and Regulations.  The
Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or list, or maintain the registration, qualification or listing of, Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares with
the SEC, any state securities commission or any securities exchange, securities association, market system or quotation system to effect such compliance. 
Grantee shall make such representations and furnish such information as may be appropriate to permit the Company, in light of the then existence or non-
existence of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares, to issue or transfer Restricted
Share Units or Vested Shares in compliance with the provisions of that or any comparable federal securities law and all applicable state securities laws.  The
Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to register the issuance or transfer of Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares or resale of Restricted
Share Units or Vested Shares under the Securities Act or any comparable federal securities law or applicable state securities law.
 
A-5
 
12.          Transferability.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and only with the Company’s consent, Grantee may transfer Restricted Share Units for
estate planning purposes or pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that any transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of
the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms and shall execute an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in connection with such
transfer; and provided, further that Grantee will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms.  Except as
otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 12, the Restricted Share Units shall not be transferable by Grantee other than by will or the laws of descent
and distribution.
 
13.          Employment Violation.  The terms of this Section 13 shall apply to the Restricted Share Units if Grantee is or becomes subject to an
employment agreement with any entity in the Company Group.  In the event of an Employment Violation, the Company shall have the right to require (a) the
forfeiture by Grantee to the Company of any outstanding Restricted Share Units or Vested Shares which have yet to settle pursuant to Section 8 hereof and
(b) payment by Grantee to the Company of the Recapture Amount with respect to such Employment Violation; provided, however, that, in lieu of payment by
Grantee to the Company of the Recapture Amount, Grantee, in his or her discretion, may tender to the Company the Vested Shares acquired during the Look-
back Period with respect to such Employment Violation (without any consideration from the Company in exchange therefor).  Any such forfeiture of
Restricted Share Units and payment of the Recapture Amount, as the case may be, shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy
available to the Company arising out of or in connection with such Employment Violation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate Grantee’s
employment if not already terminated and to seek injunctive relief and additional monetary damages.
 
14.          Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and Company Policies and Procedures.
 
(a)           Grantee is responsible for complying with (i) any federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to Grantee in connection with
the Award and (ii) all Exercise Rules and Regulations.
 
(b)           The Award is subject to the terms and conditions of any policy requiring or permitting the Company to recover any gains realized
by Grantee in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, the Policy on Recoupment of Performance-Based Compensation Related to Certain
Financial Restatements.
 
A-6
 
15.          Section 409A.
 
(a)           Payments contemplated with respect to the Award are intended to comply with Section 409A, and all provisions of the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall guarantee that the Award is not subject
to taxes or penalties under Section 409A and (ii) if any provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms would, in the reasonable, good faith
judgment of the Company, result or likely result in the imposition on Grantee or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, without the consent of Grantee, in the manner
that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties;
provided, however, that this Section 15 does not create an obligation on the part of the Committee or the Company to make any such modification, and in no
event shall the Company be liable for the payment of or gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by Grantee pursuant to
Section 409A.
 
(b)           Neither Grantee nor any of Grantee’s creditors or beneficiaries shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within
the meaning of Section 409A) payable with respect to the Award to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment
or garnishment.  Except as permitted under Section 409A, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) payable to Grantee or for
Grantee’s benefit with respect to the Award may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by Grantee to the Company.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if (i) the Committee determines in good faith that the Restricted Share
Units do not qualify for the “short-term deferral exception” under Section 409A, (ii) Grantee is a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A) and
(iii) a delay in the issuance or transfer of Vested Shares to Grantee or his or her estate or beneficiaries hereunder by reason of Grantee’s “separation from
service” (as defined in Section 409A) with any entity in the Company Group is required to avoid tax penalties under Section 409A but is not already provided
for by this Award, the Company shall cause the issuance or transfer of such Vested Shares to Grantee or Grantee’s estate or beneficiary upon the earlier of
(A) the date that is the first business day following the date that is six months after the date of Grantee’s separation from service or (B) Grantee’s death.
 
A-7
 
16.          Legend.  The Company may, if determined by it based on the advice of counsel to be appropriate, cause any certificate evidencing Vested
Shares to bear a legend substantially as follows:
 
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE ‘ACT’), OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT.”
 
17.          No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be construed to confer upon
Grantee any right to be continued in the employ of any entity in the Company Group or derogate from any right of any entity in the Company Group to retire,
request the resignation of, or discharge Grantee at any time, with or without Cause.
 
18.          No Rights as Stockholder.  No holder of Restricted Share Units shall, by virtue of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, be entitled to any
right of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of any such holder are limited to those expressed, and are not enforceable
against the Company except to the extent set forth in the Plan, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms.
 
19.          Severability.  In the event that one or more of the provisions of these Award Terms shall be invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall continue to be valid and fully enforceable.
 
20.          Venue and Governing Law.
 
(a)           For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant of
the Restricted Share Units or these Award Terms, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such
litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Los Angeles County, California or the federal courts of the United States for the Central District of
California, and no other courts, regardless of where the grant of the Restricted Share Units is made and/or to be performed.
 
(b)           To the extent that federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the Grant
Notice and these Award Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
A-8
 
21.          Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of the Grant Notice and these Award Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, its successors and assigns, and Grantee and, to the extent applicable, Grantee’s permitted assigns under Section 12 hereof and Grantee’s estate or
beneficiaries as determined by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
22.          Notices.
 
(a)           Any notice or other document which Grantee may be required or permitted to deliver to the Company pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to the Company, at its office at 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: Stock Plan Administration, or such other address as the
Company by notice to Grantee may designate in writing from time to time.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
(b)           Any notice or other document which the Company may be required or permitted to deliver to Grantee pursuant to or in connection
with the Grant Notice or these Award Terms shall be in writing, and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier, addressed
to Grantee at the address shown on any employment agreement or offer letter between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, or
such other address as Grantee by notice to the Company may designate in writing from time to time.  The Company may also, in its sole discretion, deliver
any such document to Grantee electronically via an e-mail to Grantee at his or her Company-provided email address or through a notice delivered to such e-
mail address that such document is available on a website established and maintained on behalf of the Company or a third party designated by the Company,
including, without limitation, the Equity Account Administrator.  Notices shall be effective upon delivery.
 
23.          Conflict with Employment Agreement or Plan.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time and the terms of the Grant Notice or these Award Terms, the terms of the Grant
Notice or these Award Terms, as the case may be, shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of any employment agreement or offer letter
between Grantee and any entity in the Company Group in effect at the time, the Grant Notice or these Award Terms and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the
Plan shall control.
 
24.          Imposition of Other Requirements.  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Grantee’s participation in the Plan, on
the Restricted Share Units and on any Common Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to
facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require Grantee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the
foregoing.
 
25.          Waiver.  Grantee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of these Award Terms shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Award Terms, or of any subsequent breach by Grantee or any other grantee of an equity award from the
Company.
