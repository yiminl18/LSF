Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporat
ed in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate officesare located in Seatt
le, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Marketunder the symbol “AMZN.”
As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” 
“our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.General
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion forinvention, commitment 
to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers,sellers, developers, ent
erprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising.        We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the waythe Company evaluates its busin
ess performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segmen
t Information.” The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included inour consolidated financi
al statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.Consumers
We serve consumers through our on
line and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds ofmillions of unique products to b
e sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobileapps, Alexa, and physically visit
ing our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echodevices, and we develop and produce 
media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product pricing and shippingoffers, and to improve our ope
rating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast andreliable fulfil
lment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100million items, acc
ess to unlimited streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.We fulfill custome
r orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrang
ements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, whichare supplemented by co-sour
ced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”Sellers
We offer programs tha
t enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of recordin these transactions. We
 earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.Developers and Enterprises
We serve developers and en
terprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, whichoffers a broad set of globa
l compute, storage, database, and other service offerings.3

Table of ContentsContent Creators
We serve authors and independ
ent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royaltyoption and make their books ava
ilable in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allowauthors, musicians, film
makers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.Competition
Our businesses encompass a large v
ariety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete isevolving rapidly and intense
ly competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current andpotential competito
rs include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the productswe offer and sell to consume
rs and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distributionchannels; (3) web search eng
ines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, oracquiring goods an
d services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including websitedevelopment, advertising, 
fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or forthird parties, whether onl
ine or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-basedinfrastructure and other ser
vices; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. Webelieve that the principal com
petitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additionalcompetitive facto
rs for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability andwillingness to change business pra
ctices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brandrecognition, and greate
r control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursuerestrictive distr
ibution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers withrestrictive ter
ms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and thedevelopment of new business models 
and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliancesthat strengthen their 
competitive positions.Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectualproperty as critica
l to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements withour employees, customers, pa
rtners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. andinternational domain n
ames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain ofour proprietary technology. 
We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.Seasonality
Our business is affected by season
ality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Werecognized 
32% , 34% , and 31% of our annual revenue during th e fourth quarter of 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Fourth quarter 2017 results inc lude revenueattributable to Whol
e Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017.Employees
We employed approximately 
647,500 full-time and part -time employees as of December 31, 2018 . However, employment levels f luctuate due to seasonalfactors affecting ou
r business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils,statutory employee rep
resentation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within theUnited States. We consider our 
employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly forsoftware engineers, comput
er scientists, and other technical staff.Available Information

Risk Factors Please carefully consid
er the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flowscould be materially adversely
 affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolv
ing and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, andomnichannel retail, e-commerce service
s, digital content and electronic devices, web and infrastructure computing services, and transportation and logisticsservices, and across geograph
ies, including cross-border competition. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, morecustomers, and/or great
er brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may securebetter terms from v
endors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition may intensify, 
including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as ourcompetitors enter in
to business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Inaddition, new and enhanced techno
logies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase ourcompetition. The Intern
et facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are rapidly and signi
ficantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure tosupport our retail and serv
ices businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,operations, systems,
 technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growtheffectively, which could d
amage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competi
tiveRisks
We may have limited o
r no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our offerings. These offerings may present new anddifficult technology ch
allenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Inaddition, profitabili
ty, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities torecoup our investments in th
em. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We may not be able to ac
curately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of ourexpenses and investments is f
ixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustain
able, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on thecontinued growth of demand for th
e products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditionsworldwide. A softening of demand, whether 
caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreasedrevenue or growth.
Our sales and operating resul
ts will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following:•
our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;•
our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;•
our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;•
the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;•
changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;6

the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computerintrusions, outages, and simil
ar events; and•
terrorist attacks and armed hostilities.Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are
 significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments,we have relatively li
ttle operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, andmaintain internat
ional operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•
local economic and political conditions;•
government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as tradeprotection measures, in
cluding export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;•
restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, includinguncertainty as a result of
 less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regardingthe physical and digital
 distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;•
business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•
limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•
limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•
shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•
laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;•
lower levels of use of the Internet;•
lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•
lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•
difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;7

Table of Contents•
different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;•
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officialsand other third parties;
•
laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•
geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international physical, 
e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolvingbusiness models. Local compani
es may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, aswell as their more est
ablished local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our internationalgrowth.
The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Ind
ia regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and licenserequirements that may restrict (i) f
oreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internetcontent, and (iii) the s
ale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies tha
t are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technologyservices in China in conjunct
ion with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indiancompanies by foreign enti
ties involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics servicesto third-party selle
rs to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on thewww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we b
elieve these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India areactively considering chan
ges in their foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding theinterpretation of PRC and Indian 
laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, ourChinese and Indian businesses and oper
ations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforcecontractual rela
tionships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing orfuture PRC, Indian or other laws or regu
lations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subjectto fines and other financ
ial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillm
ent Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be HarmedIf we do not adequately predi
ct customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result inexcess or insufficient 
fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. As wecontinue to add fulfill
ment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks becomeincreasingly complex and op
erating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.In addition, a failure 
to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We andour co-sourcers may be unabl
e to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we performinventory fulfillmen
t services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may beunable to optimize our fu
lfillment network.We rely on a limited nu
mber of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiateacceptable terms with these c
ompanies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customerexperience. In addition, ou
r ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclementweather, fire, flood, power loss, 
earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors.Under some of our commerci
al agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory andoperating our fulfill
ment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demandwould result in unexpected costs 
and other harm to our business and reputation.8

Table of ContentsThe Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
We expect a disproportion
ate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amountssuch that we fail to mee
t customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to takesignificant inventory m
arkdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shippingcost due to complimenta
ry upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too manycustomers access our websit
es within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailableor prevent us from effi
ciently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, wemay be unable to adequate
ly staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies andcustomer service co-sourcers
 may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment networkoptimization and invento
ry.We generally have paym
ent terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers.As a result of holiday sales, as o
f December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (otherthan as a result of cash f
lows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payableas of December 31. Our accounts pay
able balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cashequivalents, and marketable
 securities balances.Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strat
egic Alliances, and OtherBusiness Relationships
We provide physical, e-c
ommerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and businessrelationships. Under these ag
reements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers tooffer products or servic
es through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resourcecommitments, which may l
imit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of thesecommercial relationships, w
hich may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware,content, and third-party so
ftware, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercialagreements is parti
ally dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, if the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation wereceive may be lower than
 expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships andstrategic allian
ces on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful inimplementing, maint
aining, or developing these services.As our agreements termin
ate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter intoamendments on less favorab
le terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operatingresults.
Our present and fut
ure e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
impairment of other relationships;•
variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and•
difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and inves
ted in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. Thesetransactions (such as our a
cquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.) create risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
problems retaining key personnel;•
additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;•
the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;9

Table of Contents•
the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result ofany integration of opera
tions;•
the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;•
the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;•
the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, andother administrative systems
 to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;•
for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on theinvestee’s accounting, f
inancial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;•
the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;•
the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;•
potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and•
for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, andregulatory risks associate
d with specific countries.As a result of future acquis
itions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, oramortization expenses 
related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, ifat all. In addition, valu
ations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We coulddetermine that such valuatio
ns have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, 
and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposedto foreign exchange rat
e fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses onthe remeasurement o
f intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We alsohold cash equivalents and/or 
marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollar strengthenscompared to these currencies
, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain H
ighly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect OurBusiness
We depend on our senior manage
ment and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “keyperson” life insurance po
licies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically beenintense, particular
ly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or theinability to hire, tr
ain, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
Because we process, store, and tr
ansmit large amounts of data, including personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other securitybreaches, including brea
ches of our vendors’ or customers’ technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of suchinformation, adversely 
affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, andotherwise harm our business and r
eputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption andauthentication techno
logy, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced pastsecurity breaches, and, a
lthough they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.Although we have developed systems and pro
cesses that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including10

Table of Contentssystems and processes designed to 
reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security.We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occas
ional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficientlyfulfilling orders or prov
iding services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable tocontinually add software and h
ardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, itcould cause system inter
ruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.Our computer and communica
tions systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,earthquakes, acts of war or 
terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events couldcause system interrupt
ion, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which couldmake our product and servic
e offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not besufficient. In addition, we 
may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and beexpensive to remedy.
We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed tosignificant inventory r
isks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles andpricing, defective m
erchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,and other factors. We end
eavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand forproducts, however, can change signi
ficantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling ormanufacturing a new product, 
it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecastdemand. The acquisition of c
ertain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry abroad selection and signif
icant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities orduring the relevant sel
ling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intell
ectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third PartiesWe regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical toour success, and we rely on trade
mark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,customers, and others to prot
ect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products andservices are made av
ailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore,regulations governing domain n
ames may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiringdomain names that are s
imilar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.We may not be able to discov
er or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights alsomay take actions that dimini
sh the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure ofsignificant financi
al and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or preventthird parties from in
fringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquireequivalent or superior t
echnology or other intellectual property rights.Other parties also may c
laim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legalproceedings regarding al
leged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in theexpenditure of signific
ant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations.We may need to obtain li
censes from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to usor at all. In addition, we m
ay not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual propertywe do not own. These risks have been ampli
fied by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.11

Table of ContentsOur digital content offeri
ngs depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rightsmanagement technology th
at we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to includetheir content in our serv
ice.We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highl
y VolatileWe have a rapidly evolving bus
iness model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risksdescribed elsewhere in th
is Item 1A, as well as:•
changes in interest rates;•
conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;•
quarterly variations in operating results;•
fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;•
changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;•
changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•
changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•
transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.Volatility in our stock pri
ce could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees orgrant larger stock awards 
than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to gene
ral business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, andomnichannel retail, 
electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may covertaxation, privacy, data p
rotection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste,energy consumption, environmen
tal regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade andprotectionist measur
es, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our servicesor access to our facil
ities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services,product labeling, and the co
mmercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel,data protection, and per
sonal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, and artificial intelligence technologies and services.Jurisdictions may regula
te consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations, laws, and decisionsinterpreting or applying 
those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doingbusiness.
We Could Be Subject to Additional Tax Liabilities and Coll
ection ObligationsWe are subject to a va
riety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognizeadditional tax expense and b
e subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,administrative pra
ctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accountingrules in various jurisdic
tions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions areconsidering or have adopted l
aws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and theremote selling of goods and se
rvices. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remotesellers, or other requi
rements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countrieshave proposed or enacted tax
es on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected byadditional taxes of this n
ature imposed on us or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure toprovide information about ou
r customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also maynot have sufficient noti
ce to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply by the effective date.12

Table of ContentsOur tax expense and liabili
ties may also be affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into newbusinesses and geographies, inte
rcompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able torealize relat
ed tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in ourdeferred tax assets and 
liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinarycourse of our business, there a
re many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known as theU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requir
es complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law,significant judgments to b
e made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis ofinformation not previously 
relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret orissue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act wil
l be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments toamounts that we have previously 
recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made.We are also current
ly subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us.Developments in an audit, inves
tigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods forwhich that development occu
rs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from theseproceedings to determin
e the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, andany other tax controversi
es could be materially different from our historical tax accruals.Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppl
iers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,manufacturing, and any re
lated ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guaranteeavailability of me
rchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stopselling or licensing me
rchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplierbankruptcies due to poor econom
ic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers ina timely and effic
ient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code ofstandards and responsibilit
ies, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit ourgrowth, and negatively affe
ct our operating results.We May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Rela
ted Procurement RegulationsOur contracts with U.S., as well as stat
e, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirementsrelating to their fo
rmation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and anyviolations could result in v
arious civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments,forfeiture of profi
ts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination bythe government at any ti
me, without cause.We May Be Subject to Product Liability Cla
ims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or ManufactureSome of the products we sell or m
anufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, orenvironmental or proper
ty damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our services and stores that mayincrease our exposure to produ
ct liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liabilityinsurance, we cannot
 be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us oneconomically reasonab
le terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks
We accept payments using
 a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debitfrom a customer’s bank a
ccount, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to ourcustomers, we may bec
ome subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processesthat could result in signi
ficant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods,13

Table of Contentsincluding credit and debi
t cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely onthird parties to provide 
certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronicchecks, and promotional fin
ancing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. Wealso offer co-branded credit
 card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card associationoperating rules, including d
ata security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted tomake it difficult o
r impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached, compromised, orotherwise unable to detec
t or prevent fraudulent activity, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose ourability to accept c
redit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and ourbusiness and operating results 
could be adversely affected.In addition, we provide regula
ted services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to thirdparties, and because we provid
e services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements forlicensing, regulatory insp
ection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining orprocessing data, and authent
ication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, moneylaundering, internation
al money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws orregulations, we could be subjec
t to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.We Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sell
ersThe law relating to the l
iability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies could require changes in the way thisbusiness is conducted. Under our sell
er programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers neverreceive the products they
 ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions. We also may be unable to prevent sellers inour stores or through other stor
es from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating theproprietary rights of oth
ers, or otherwise violating our policies. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in thesesituations, and as our third-p
arty seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, to the extentany of this occurs, it could ha
rm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward
-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Allstatements other than s
tatements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position,made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ar
e forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions toidentify forward-lookin
g statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results coulddiffer materia
lly for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customerspending, world events, the rate o
f growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunitiesand the timing of those inves
tments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, theextent to which we owe income or oth
er taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion,the outcomes of legal pro
ceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degreeto which we enter into, maint
ain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks offulfillment throughput 
and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well asother risks and uncertai
nties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A ofPart I, “Risk Factors.”
Overview
Our
primary
source
of
revenue
is
the
sale

f
a
wide
range
of
products
and
services
to
customers
. The products offered through our s tores includemerchandise and content we h
ave purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally,we recognize gross revenue f
rom items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers asservice sales. We seek 
to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer otherservices such as compute, sto
rage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, and advertising.Our
financial
focus
is
on
long-term,
sustainab
le
growth
in
free
cash
flows
1
.
Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income andefficiently manag
ing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operatingincome primarily r
esult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make inlonger-term strat
egic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including loweringprices, improving availabilit
y, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expandingproduct information, imp
roving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.We
seek
to
reduce
our
variabl
e
costs
per
unit
and
work
to
leverage
our
fixed
costs.
Our variable costs include p roduct and content costs, payment processingand related transac
tion costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and aportion of our marketing cos
ts. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to ouronline stores, web services, e
lectronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities. Variable costs generallychange directly with sal
es volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and otherfactors. To decrease our v
ariable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discountsfrom suppliers, and reduce d
efects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________

om consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affectedby numerous factors, including ou
r product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability andselection of product off
erings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.We also expect some var
iability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of salesby third-party sellers, 
the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of paymentterms with suppliers.

We utilize restr icted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because webelieve this compensat
ion model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested andunvested stock awards outstanding, withou
t regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million and 507million

. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens y
ear-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses willbe higher than if curren
cies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, ourconsolidated net sales and op
erating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond theU.S. economy through our growing internation
al businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operatingresults and growth rates befo
re and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasu
rement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreigncurrency exchange rat
es. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidatedtrends and comparisons.

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Judgments
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates andassumptions that affec
t the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidatedfinancial statem
ents and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal ofthe company’s financia
l condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result ofthe need to make estimates 
of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgmentsaddressed below. We also have oth
er key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understandingour results. For additional in
formation, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and AccountingPolicies.” Although we believe th
at our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual resultsmay differ signific
antly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptionsabout future disposition of inv
entory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in thefuture. As a measure of sensi
tivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018 , we would have recorded an addition al costof sales of approximate
ly $190 million.In addition, we enter
 into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecastedcustomer demand. If we redu
ce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income
Taxes
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles,and interpretations in v
arious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, andsignificant judgment is 
required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinarycourse of business for which the ul
timate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in ourbusiness operations, acquisit
ions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,including earnings being lower 
than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we havehigher statutory rates, 
losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes inforeign currency exchang
e rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,administrative pra
ctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accountingrules in various jurisdic
tions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as theU.S. tax reform legislation 
commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws inresponse to the U.S. Tax Act that could r
esult in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how th
e U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were notpreviously required by U.S. tax law, signi
ficant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations,and the preparation and an
alysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-settingbodies will continue to inte
rpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued,we may make adjustments to 
amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which theadjustments are made.
We are also current
ly subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.Developments in an audit, inves
tigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods forwhich that development occu
rs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from theseproceedings to determin
e the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, andany other tax controversi
es could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.20

Cash flow information, which ref

ry Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions): 
  
 Year Ended December 31,  
2016  2017  2018 Cash provided by (used in):
     Operating activities
$ 17,203  $18,365  $30,723 Investing activities
(9,516 )  (27,084 )  (12,369 ) Financing activities
(3,716 )  9,928  (7,686 ) Our principal sources of liqu
idity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fairvalue, were $ 
26.0 billion , $31.0 billion , and $41.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Amounts held in foreign curren cies were $9.1 billion , $11.1 billion 
, and $13.8 billion , as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , and were primarily Euros, Bri tish Pounds, and Japanese Yen.Cash 
provided by (used in) operating activities was $17.2 billion , $18.4 billion , and $30.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash 
received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make forproducts and services, employ
ee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-termobligations. Cash received f
rom our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buyfrom us, our receivables 
from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the compar able prior years, isprimarily due to the in
crease in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) 
operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, includingseasonality, inventory man
agement and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchangerates.
Cash 
provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received fromproperty and equipment vendors, 
cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturitiesof marketable secur
ities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(9.5) billion , $(27.1) billion , and $(12.4) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , with the variability caused pr
imarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales ofmarketable securi
ties. Cash capital expenditures were $ 6.7 billion , $ 10.1 billion , and $11.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , which primarily refl ect additionalcapacity to support our ful
fillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority ofwhich is to support AWS), during all thr
ee years. In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and otherinvestment activity of 
$116 million , $14.0 billion , and $2.2 billion . Cash 
provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.7) billion , $9.9 billion , and $(7.7) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal re
payments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other, which were $4.3 billion 
, $6.3 billion , and $8.5 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Property and equipment acqui red under capital leases was $5.7 billion , $9.6 billion , and $10.6 billion 
in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , with the increase reflecting investm ents in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technologyinfrastructure for AWS, which 
investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-termdebt and other. Proceeds from 
long-term debt and other were $618 million , $16.2 billion , and $768 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . During 2017, cash inflows from financing activ
ities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through2057. The proceeds from notes issued 
in August 2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market,to repay notes due in 2017, and for gen
eral corporate purposes.21

Table of ContentsIn April 2018, we established a com
mercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecuredcommercial paper up 
to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individua l maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The re wereno borrowings outstanding under the Comme
rcial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 . We had no borrowings outstanding under our uns
ecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $594 million of borrowings outstanding under our 
$620 million secured revolving credi t facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statements and SupplementaryData — Note 5 — Debt” for additiona
l information. In 
2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion . Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject toU.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also rep
eals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of ourforeign subsidiary earnings, 
as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incursignificant, additiona
l costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of December 31, 2018 , cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities held by foreignsubsidiaries was $12.0 billion.
We have tax benefits relating
 to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce ourU.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced 
and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualifiedproperty, primarily equ
ipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $412 million , $957 million , and $1.2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . As of December 31, 2018 
, our federal net opera ting loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset
 future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilizeour federal net opera
ting losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on afinancial reporting b
asis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed aninitial recovery a
mount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subjectto adjustment pending conclus
ion of all appeals.Our liquidity is als
o affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certainjurisdictions, debt, and standby 
and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to ourcustomers, some jurisdic
tions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cashequivalents from “Cash and c
ash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets.As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2018 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.3 billion and $426 million . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements 
and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments,as well as our pledged assets. Addit
ionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments,were 
$13.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 . These purchase obligations and op en purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through thecontractual provisions.
We believe that cash 
flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowingarrangements, will be suf
ficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs andcash flows are subject to subst
antial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debtsecurities, obtain cr
edit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, orotherwise restructure ou
r debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.The sale of additional equ
ity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider theacquisition of, or investm
ent in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidityrequirements or cause us 
to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines orfinancing instruments wil
l be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.22

Table of ContentsResults of Operations
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Marketfrom the date of acquis
ition in August 2017. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item8 of Part II, “Financial Sta
tements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.”Net
Sales
Net sales include product and s
ervice sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media contentwhere we record revenue gross. Serv
ice sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees,AWS sales, Amazon Prime membersh
ip fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):

North America sales 
increased 33% in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the compara ble prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increasedunit sales, including sales by

increased 23% and 21% in 2017 , and 2018 , compared to the compar able prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflectsincreased unit sales, in

and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The 
increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the compar able prior years, is primarily due to increasedunit sales, including sales by

Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video andmusic, packaging supplies, sort
ation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are thetransportation servic
e provider.The 
increase in cost of sales in absolute do llars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the compar able prior years, is primarily due to increased product andshipping costs resulting from 
increased sales.Shipping costs to receive produc
ts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.Shipping costs, which include sortat
ion and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $16.2 billion , $21.7 billion , and $27.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We expect our cost of shipping 
to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shippingrates, we use more expensive sh
ipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving highersales volumes, optimizing ou
r fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offeringlow prices to our customers is 
fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment ar
e primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internaltechnology requirements 
and external sales to AWS customers.25

Table of ContentsFulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily c
onsist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer servicecenters, and physical stor
es and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs areprimarily classif
ied as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing andrelated transact
ion costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment networkand physical store expansion, th
e extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affectcustomer service cont
acts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, becausepayment processing and fulf
illment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and paymentprocessing and related t
ransaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costsas a percent of net sales.
The 
increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the compar able prior years, is primarily due to costs from expanding ourfulfillment network, which 
includes physical stores, and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels.We seek to expand our fulfi
llment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes fromsales of our own products as well as sa
les by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Marketing
We direct customers 
to our stores primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customerreferrals, social 
and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changesin rates. To the extent th
ere is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to seea corresponding change in our m
arketing costs.The 
increase in marketing costs in absolu te dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the compara ble prior years, is primarily due to payroll and relatedexpenses for personnel engaged 
in marketing and selling activities, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.While costs associated wi
th Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effectiveworldwide marketing tools, and in
tend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology
and
Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructurecosts. Infrastructure 
costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWSand other Amazon businesses. Collec
tively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest effi
ciently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our processefficiency through rap
id technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spendingprojects often support a va
riety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expectspending in technology and content 
to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segmentsbased on usage. The 
increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the compar able prior years, is primarily due to anincrease in spending on techno
logy infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existingproducts and services and ini
tiatives to introduce new products and service offerings.General

The

Taxes
Our effective tax ra
te is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix ofjurisdictions to which they r
elate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments,audit-related deve
lopments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses),changes in statutes, regul
ations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,competition, and other l
aws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.Additionally, our effect
ive tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our ef
fective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act s
ignificantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,lowering the statutory corpo
rate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries, introducing new t
ax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option toclaim acceler
ated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated theeffects of the U.S. Tax Act and re
corded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for theimpact of the U.S. Tax Act of approxi
mately $789 million. This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilitiesresulting from the per
manent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on theaccumulated earnings o
f our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accountingimplications of the U.S. Tax Act.
We recorded a provision fo
r income taxes of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Our provision for income taxes in 2017was lower than in 2016 primarily du
e to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offsetby an increase in the propor
tion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. We have recorded valuationallowances against the de
ferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit.We regularly assess whethe
r it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. Inperforming this assessmen
t with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. InQ2 2017, we recognized an estimat
ed charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefitof the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was pa
rtially offset by the reduction to the27

ate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit, and an increase in excess tax benefitsfrom stock-based compensa
tion.We have tax benefits relating
 to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce ourU.S. taxable income. As of 
December 31, 2018 , our federal net opera ting loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion 
of federal tax credits potentiall y available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research anddevelopment credit.

2016 , 2017 , and 2018 were our equity-method inves tment gains (losses) during the years and impairments recorded in 2016.Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measur
es, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our me
asures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet thedefinition of non-GAAP financial m
easures.We provide multiple m
easures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property andequipment with cash and through c
apital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidatedstatements of cash flows to 
add restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —Description of Business and Accounting Poli
cies.”Free

Guidance
We provided guidance on 
January 31, 2019 , in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflectAmazon.com’s expectations 
as of January 31, 2019 , and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materiallyaffected by many fac
tors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate ofgrowth of the Internet, onlin
e commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2019 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $60 billion, or to grow between 10% and 18% compared with first quarter 2018. This guidanceanticipates an unfavor
able impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates.•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in first quarter 2018.•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.30

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market ri
sk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.Information relat
ing to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Resul
ts of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk fo
r changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried atamortized cost and flu
ctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at afixed rate, will gener
ally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing ratesof interest. All of o
ur cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value onour consolidated balance sh
eets. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixedincome securities. Fixed 
income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal ifforced to sell securi
ties that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides in

and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $25.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 . Foreign Exchange Risk
During 
2018 , net sales from our Inte rnational segment accounted for 28% of our consolidated revenues. Ne t sales and related expenses generated from ourinternationally-fo
cused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in thefunctional currenci
es of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of ourintercompany balances 
associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, asforeign exchange rates v
ary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on theremeasurement of intercompany 
balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect theprior year, Internat
ional segment net sales increased by $1.3 billion in comparison with the prior y ear.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance offoreign funds as of 
December 31, 2018 , of $13.8 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of$690 million, $1.4 billion, and $2.8 bil
lion. All cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fairvalue are recorded in “Acc
umulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fairvalues are included in “M
arketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as ofDecember 31, 2018 
, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $145 million, $305 million, and $685 million,recorded to “Other incom
e (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Man
agement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect ofForeign Exchange Rates” for addi
tional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.32

Table of ContentsInvestment Risk
As of 
December 31, 2018 , our recorded value in equi ty and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $942 million. Our equity andequity warrant investmen
ts in publicly traded companies represent $518 million of our investments as of December 31, 2018 , and are recorded at f air value, whichis subject to market price 
volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessmentindicates that an imp
airment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment tofair value. Our assessment 
includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly availabledata. The current global
 economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readilyavailable market d
ata. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.33

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS A
ND ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,developers, enterprises, 
and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offerprograms that enable se
llers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and appdevelopers, and others to publish 
and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of globalcompute, storage, databas
e, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising.We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amoun
ts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cashequivalents on our consolidat
ed statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance.Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have avariable interest 
and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities(collectively, the 
“Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market,Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) h
ave been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, revenu
es and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates areused for, but not limited to, 
income taxes, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiturerates, vendor funding, and invento
ry valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is 
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh
ares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a netloss, stock awards are excluded 
from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.The following table shows the cal
culation of diluted shares (in millions):

Table of ContentsRevenue
Revenue is measured based on the 
amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, andrebates. Revenue also exclud
es any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multipleperformance obligations, t
he transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determinestand-alone selling pri
ces based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.A description of our principa
l revenue generating activities is as follows:Retail
sales
- We offer consumer produ cts through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to thecustomer, which generally o
ccurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Third-party
seller
services
- We offer programs th at enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller ofrecord in these transa
ctions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services arerendered, which generally o
ccurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Subscription
services
- Our subscription sales includ e fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digitalvideo, e-books, digital music, 
and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits thatrepresent a single stand
-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements isrecognized over the subscr
iption period.AWS
- Our AWS arrangements include g lobal sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-aloneselling prices and is pri
marily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacitydelivered on-demand. Cert
ain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognizedratably. Sales commissions we p
ay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.Other
- Other revenue primar ily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks orimpressions.
Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce 
revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in“Accrued expenses and other” 
and were $567 million , $468 million , and $623 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Additions to the allowance were 
$1.5 billion , $1.8 billion , and $2.3 billion and deductions from the al lowance were $1.5 billion , $1.9 billion , and $2.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Included in “Inventories
” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $411 million , $406 million , and $519 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 
2018 , for the rights to recove r products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video andmusic, packaging supplies, sort
ation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are thetransportation servic
e provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale ofproducts to our customers. Paymen
t processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” onour consolidated statem
ents of operations.Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with ou
r vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generallyconsider these amounts re
ceived from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and arerecorded as a reduction o
f the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimumpurchase thresholds. We eva
luate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can bereasonably estimated, we 
record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.42

Table of ContentsFulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,customer service cen
ters, and physical stores, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, andpreparing customer orde
rs for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain sellertransactions; responding to 
inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also includeamounts paid to third part
ies that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.Marketing
Marketing costs primar
ily consist of targeted online advertising, payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, andtelevision advertising. We
 pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertisingarrangements with cer
tain of our vendors, and other third parties.Advertising and other promotion
al costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $5.0 billion , $6.3 billion , and $8.2 billion in 2016 
, 2017 , and 2018 . Prepaid advertising costs wer e not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructurecosts. Infrastructure 
costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWSand other Amazon businesses. Collec
tively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.Technology and content costs ar
e generally expensed as incurred.General and Administrative
General and administra
tive expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation expense andrent; professional fe
es and litigation costs; and other general corporate costs for corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources,among others.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all sto
ck awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair valueof restricted stock uni
ts is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense overthe service period, net 
of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,and to the extent actual re
sults or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the periodestimates are revised. We con
sider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level.Other Operating Expense, Net
Other operating expen
se, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, andexpenses related to leg
al settlements.Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $21 million , $247 million , and $(206) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 
and equity warrant valuat ion gains (losses) of $67 million , $109 million , and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 and equity securities ga ins of $1 million 
, $18 million , and $145 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 43

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
Income tax expense includ
es U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S.Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxat
ion on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings,as well as our capital in ou
r foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs uponrepatriation of such a
mounts.Deferred income tax balances
 reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and arestated at enacted tax rates ex
pected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets are eval
uated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We considermany factors when assessing the 
likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.We utilize a two-step 
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax positionfor recognition by deter
mining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution ofrelated appeals or l
itigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized uponultimate settle
ment. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments andwhich may not accurately 
forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as th
e price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. To i
ncrease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used tomeasure fair value:
Level 1 — 
Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 — 
Valuations based on observable inpu ts other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilitiesin active markets, quoted
 prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable 
market data.Level 3 — 
Valuations based on unobservable inpu ts reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by othermarket participan
ts. These valuations require significant judgment.For our cash, cash equivalents, or 
marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices inactive markets for identical asset
s or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or basedon quoted market prices of s
imilar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cashequivalents, or marketable 
securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As part of entering into com
mercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As ofDecember 31, 2017 
and 2018 , these warrants had a fai r value of $441 million and $440 million , and are recorded within “Oth er assets” on our consolidatedbalance sheets. The rel
ated gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $67 million , $109 million , and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . These assets are prima
rily classified as Level 2 assets.Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly 
liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.We provide Fulfillment by Am
azon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,regardless of whether ful
fillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.44

Table of ContentsWe also purchase electronic 
device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for ourproducts. During the normal cours
e of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements withcontract manufacturers and s
uppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreementsconsists of firm, non-canc
ellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incuradditional costs. We also h
ave firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts rece
ivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As ofDecember 31, 2017 
and 2018 , customer receivabl es, net, were $6.4 billion and $9.4 billion , vendor receivables, net, we re $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion , and seller receivables, net, were 
$692 million and $710 million . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which providesfunding to sellers prima
rily to procure inventory.We estimate losses on r
eceivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired andwritten-off when it is probab
le that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtfulaccounts was 
$237 million , $348 million , and $495 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Additions to the allowance were $451 million , $626million 
, and $878 million , and deductions to the allowanc e were $403 million , $515 million , and $731 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Software Development Costs
We incur software develop
ment costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Softwaredevelopment costs capit
alized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed asincurred.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are s
tated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as areduction in our costs. Property 
includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit, finance, and capital leasearrangements. Equipment 
includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis ov
er the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining lif e of the underlying building, three years for our servers, 
five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment) . Depreciation expense isclassified within the co
rresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations
We categorize leases at their incepti
on as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and otherincentives provided by the l
andlord. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer thecommencement date of required 
payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leaseholdimprovements are capitalized at co
st and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in theconstruction of structur
al improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, weassess whether these arrang
ements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilitiesare accounted for as f
inance leases.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Suchassets are depreciated over t
he lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.As disclosed in “Accounting Pronouncemen
ts Not Yet Adopted,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019.45

Table of ContentsGoodwill
We evaluate goodwill for 
impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not berecoverable. In test
ing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of areporting unit is less than 
its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-stepimpairment test. We test goo
dwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of thereporting units. If the f
air value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, asecond step is performe
d to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimatethe fair value of the 
reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operatingexpenses, based primarily on 
expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.We completed the requ
ired annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2018 , and determined that goodwil l is no timpaired as the fai
r value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test.See “Note 4 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired 
Intangible Assets.”Other Assets
Included in “Other as
sets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization;video and music conte
nt, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer thanone year, the majority o
f which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; and equity warrant assets.Video and Music Content
We obtain video and music con
tent for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions, which include both fixed andvariable payment schedules
. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is availablefor streaming, we recogni
ze an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are made and weamortize the asset 
to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges from one to fiveyears. If we are unable to 
reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also developoriginal content. Capita
lized production costs associated with our original content are limited by the amount of revenue we expect to earn, which results in aportion being expensed as incur
red. These capitalized costs are amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customerstreams in the first month
s after availability.Investments
We generally invest our 
excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Suchinvestments are included i
n “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securitiesare classified as av
ailable-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”Equity investments are a
ccounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but notcontrol, over an investee. Equ
ity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses asreported by equity-method 
investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity -
 method investment activity, netof tax” on our consolidated st
atements of operations.Equity investments without re
adily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for atcost with adjustments for obse
rvable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.Equity investments that
 have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fairvalue with changes recogniz
ed in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statement of operations.We periodically evaluate whet
her declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity method investments, we alsoevaluate whether decl
ines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative andquantitative facto
rs regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recoveryoccurs. Additionally, we
46

Table of Contentsassess whether we have plans to sel
l the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis.Factors considered incl
ude: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investeesecurities; credit quality of 
debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of thedecline in value; and our s
trategy and intentions for holding the investment.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwi
ll, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of theassets might not be recove
rable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset, a significant ch
ange in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount ofan asset or group of assets may no
t be recoverable.For long-lived assets used in oper
ations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted,probability-weighted futu
re cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-livedassets are considered he
ld for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for salein its immediate cond
ition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value lesscosts to sell. Assets held for sa
le were not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued e
xpenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations,payroll and related exp
enses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2018 , our liabilities for payr oll related expenses were $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion and our liabilities fo r unredeemed gift cardswere 
$3.0 billion and $2.8 billion . We reduce the liabi lity for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to beredeemed is recogniz
ed based on customer usage patterns.Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is record
ed when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.Unearned revenue primar
ily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2017 was $6.1 billion 
, of which $5.3 billion was recognized as revenue dur ing the year ended December 31, 2018 , including adjustments re lated to the new revenuerecognition guidance. Inc
luded in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2017 
and 2018 . Additionally, we have perform
ance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that havenot yet been recognized in ou
r financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $19.3 billion 
as of December 31, 2018 . The weighted average rem aining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenuerecognition is largely d
riven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.Foreign Currency
We have internationa
lly-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, aredenominated in local fun
ctional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the localcurrency. Assets and liabil
ities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translatedat average rates pr
evailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component ofstockholders’ equity, and in th
e “Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and lossesincluding intercompany t
ransactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense),net” on our consolidated sta
tements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of$62 million 
, $202 million , and $(186) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 47

Table of ContentsAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guidanceand requiring more deta
iled disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flowsarising from contrac
ts with customers. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospectiveapproach and increased r
etained earnings by approximately $650 million . The adjustment primar ily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which arenow recognized over the expec
ted customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. Wechanged the recognition and 
classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratablyover the membership per
iod as service sales. Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocatedamong product sales and servi
ce sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified as revenuerather than a reduct
ion in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have notbeen adjusted and continue to b
e reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy.The impact of applying this ASU for th
e year ended December 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease  in product sales and an increase in service salesdriven by the reclassificatio
n of Prime membership fees of approximately $3.8 billion . Service sales also incr eased by approximately $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 
due to the reclassification of certain advertising services.In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates cert
ain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.Under this ASU, certain equity invest
ments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no materialimpact to our consolidate
d financial statements.In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income taxconsequences of an interco
mpany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income taxeffects will continue 
to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250 million 
to retained earnings and d eferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the present
ation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The newguidance requires that 
restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on aretrospective basis with 
the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 2016

Table of ContentsAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities foroperating leases with te
rms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within theconsolidated statemen
ts of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASUis effective for r
eporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 with an immaterialcumulative adjustmen
t to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. This adoption approach will result in a balance sheet presentationthat will not be comparab
le to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU will result in the recognition of operating lease assets andliabilities of approximately 
$21 billion , which includes the reclass ification of finance leases to operating leases of approximately $1.2 billion , and the derecognition of build-to
-suit lease assets and liabilities when we do not control the building during the construction period of approximately $1.5 billion . Note 2 — CASH

l leases of $3.8 billion , $5.4 billion , and $7.3 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Gross assets recorded under cap ital leases were $26.4 billion 
and $36.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accumulated amortiz ation associated with capital leases was $13.4 billion and $19.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 
and 2018 . We capitalize construction in 
progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner,for accounting purposes, during th
e construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do notqualify for sales recogn
ition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This isprincipally due to our signi
ficant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or therelated leases’ t
erms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-termconstruction obligations a
re considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as “Accrued expenses andother.” Gross assets remain

In 2016, we determined that we pro
cessed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by theIran Threat Reduction and Syri
a Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, othermedia, apparel, home and k
itchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Ourreview is ongoing and we have voluntar
ily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United StatesDepartment of Commerce
’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result inthe imposition of penalt

Table of ContentsWe are subject to cl
aims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions inwhich we already collect 
and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significantadditional tax liabi
lities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period fromJanuary 2016 to March 2016, including in
terest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by ourthird-party sellers. 
We believe the assessment is without merit. If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similarnature, we could be subject to s
ignificant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from tim
e to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:In November 2007, an Austrian copyright 
collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.àr.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logist
ik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germanyseeking to collect a t
ariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed theGerman case pending a fina
l decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales ofproducts to which the tarif
f potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana’s claim and in September 2010 commenced anappeal in the Commerci
al Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, theAustrian Supreme Court refer
red the case to the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of thetariff where cert
ain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian SupremeCourt referred the cas
e back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditionsset by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercia
l Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissedAustro-Mechana’s claims. 
In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the HigherCommercial Court of Vienna con
firmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s appeal. InFebruary 2016, Austro-Mechana appea
led that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and referred 
the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been filed making similarallegations. In Decembe
r 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte (“ZPU”), filed a complaint against AmazonEU S.à r.l., Amazon Media EU S.à r.l., Amazon Servic
es Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, andAmazon Eurasia Holdings S.à r.l. in the Dis
trict Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website tocustomers located in Ger
many. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l. in the Court ofFirst Instance of Brussels, Belgiu
m, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. InNovember 2013, the Belgian court ru
led in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for adetermination of dam
ages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.Beginning in August 2013, a number of compla
ints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed tocompensate hourly workers for 
time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, In
c. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., ano

ashington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Kentu
cky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in theUnited States District Court fo
r the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and formeremployees under the Fair Labo
r Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California,Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Wash
ington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. Thecomplaints seek an unspeci
fied amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that 
time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage andhour statute. In February 2015, the 
courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. InMarch 2016, the United States Distr
ict Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealedthe district court’s 
judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of58

e district court’s decision. In June 2017, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldanacases with prejudice. We d

In 
2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion . We have tax benefits r elating to excess stock-based compensation deductions 
and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds,were 
$412 million , $957 million , and $1.2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act s
ignificantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,lowering the statutory corpo
rate tax rate from 35% to 21% , eliminating certain deductio ns, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries, introducing new t
ax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option toclaim acceler
ated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated theeffects of the U.S. Tax Act and re
corded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for theimpact of the U.S. Tax Act of approxi
mately $789 million . This amount wa s primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilitiesresulting from the per
manent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% , after taking into ac count the mandatory one-time tax on theaccumulated earnings o
f our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accountingimplications of the U.S. Tax Act.

The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.(2)
Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and beginning in 2017, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For 2017 and 2018, our taxprovision includes 
$1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of excess tax benefits f rom stock-based compensation.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-timefavorable effect o
f the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-relateddevelopments.
We regularly assess whethe
r it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. Inperforming this assessmen
t with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. InQ2 2017, we recognized an estimat
ed charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation a llowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefitof the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was pa
rtially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion offoreign losses for which we may not 
realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.Certain foreign subsidiary 
earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation ofthose earnings. We intend to 
invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of theU.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incu
r significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.63

As of 
December 31, 2018 , our federal, foreign, and s tate net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $627 million , $7.8billion 
, and $919 million . The federal, foreign, and s tate net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal RevenueCode and applicable foreign 
and state tax law. If not utilized, a portion of the federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in2029 
, 2019 , and 2019 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , our tax credit carry forwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.7 billion . If not utilized, a portion of th
e tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . As of December 31, 2018 , our federal capital loss  carryforwards for income taxpurposes was approximately 
$261 million . If not utilized, a port ion of the capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . Tax Contingencies
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our taxpositions and determining our p
rovision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which theultimate tax determination is u
ncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxeswill be due. These reserves a
re established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fullysupportable. We adjust thes
e reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes theimpact of reserve prov
isions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.64

As of December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $3.4 billion of accrued tax contingen cies, of which $1.7 billion , if fully recognized, would de crease oureffective tax rate.
As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we had accrued intere st and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $107 million and $127 million 
. Interest and penalti es, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 was $9 million , $40million 
, and $20 million . We are under examina
tion, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2005 and thereafter. These examinations may lead 
to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination aswell as subsequent periods. As previously d
isclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the2005 and 2006 calendar years re
lating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount thatwould result in additional f
ederal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On Mar ch 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding theissues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejec
ted the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for thetransactions undertaken wi
th our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. In September 2017, the IRS appealed the decision tothe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circui
t. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appealor if the IRS were to successful
ly assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject tosignificant additiona
l tax liabilities.In October 2014, the European Commission op
ened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard tothe corporate income 
tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that d
eterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision theEuropean Commission announced an est
imated recovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, for the pe riod May 2006 through June 2014, andordered Luxembourg tax author
ities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount,consistent with the European Comm
ission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. InDecember 2017, Luxembourg appeal
ed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to bewithout merit and will cont
inue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictionsincluding China, Germany, India, Jap
an, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom.  We are under, or may be subj ect to, audit or examination and additionalassessments by the rele
vant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter. We expect the total 
amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2019 . In addition, changes in stat e, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our taxcontingencies. The timing o
f the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issuesraised by the taxing author
ities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additionalassessments by various tax autho
rities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements couldresult in changes to our cont
ingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2018 . The actual amount of any ch ange could vary significantlydepending on the ultimate 
timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an eva
luation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of ourprincipal executive o
fficer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined inRule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of 
December 31, 2018 . Based on this  evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,as of 
December 31, 2018 , our disclosure controls and pro cedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us inthe reports that we fil
e or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules andforms and to provide
 reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officerand principal financial officer,
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act.Management has assessed the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on criteria est ablished in InternalControl — Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment,management concluded th
at, as of December 31, 2018 , our internal control ove r financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Ernst & Young has independently assessed 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our int
ernal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reaso nablylikely to materially affect, our i
nternal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and proc
edures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving theirobjectives as specifi
ed above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reportingwill prevent or detect 
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assu
rance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to erroror fraud will not occur or th
at all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.70

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amazon.com, 
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control —Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,Amazon.com, Inc. (the
 Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidatedbalance sheets of the Company 
as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolid ated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’equity, and cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes and ou r report dated January 31, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over 
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of f
inancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

,  a  Vest  Date),  you  may  elect  to  satisfy  your  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  delivering  to  the  Company  an  amount  that  the  Company  determines  issufficient
 to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, or such other means as the Company may establish orpermit. If you
 have made an election to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items by wire transfer or other means and, as determined by the Company, have notadequately
 funded the obligation for Tax-Related Items within five business days before a Vest Date for this Award or any other award of restricted stock unitsgranted to you under the Plan, the Comp

Right to Retain Shares or Cash. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver any Shares or the proceeds from the sale of Shares to you until
 the obligation for any Tax-Related Items due in connection with the Award has been satisfied. To the extent permitted by law, the Company has the rightto
 retain, without notice, from Shares issuable under the Award, Shares having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. Further, the Company or theEmployer has the right to retain, without notice, from salary or other amounts pa
yable to you, cash sufficient to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. If your obligation forTax-Related Items is sa

 Award, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. You agree to pay to the Companyor the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Compa
ny or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation inthe Plan that cannot be sat
isfied by the means described in this Section 9.10.

 to  the  Shares  subject  to  the  Award.  The  Company  intends  to  maintain  this  registration  but  has  no  obligation  to  do  so.  If  the  registration  ceases  to  beeffective,

 available. Such exemptions from registration are very limited and might be unavailable. You agree that any resale by you of the Shares issued pursuant to theAward
 shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the provisions of theSecurities
 Act,  the  Exchange  Act  and  the  respective  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  and  any  other  law,  rule  or  regulation  including,  withoutlimitation,
 applicable securities law and exchange control regulations for your country of residence, as all may be amended from time to time. The Company shallnot
