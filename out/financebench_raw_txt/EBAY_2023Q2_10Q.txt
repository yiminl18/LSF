NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 — The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader that connects people and builds communities to create economic opportunity for all. Our technology
empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, providing everyone the opportunity to grow and thrive.
Founded in 1995 in San Jose, California, eBay is one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique
selection.
When we refer to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” or “eBay” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we mean the current Delaware
corporation (eBay Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies,
income taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, investments including level 3 investments in Gmarket Global LLC (“Gmarket”),
warrants and the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the financial statements of eBay Inc., our wholly and majority-owned
subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIE”) where we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidation
requirement for VIEs. Generally, investments in entities where we hold at least a 20% ownership interest and have the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, including those in which the fair value option
has been elected.
For equity method investments, our share of the investees’ results of operations is included in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant,
net and investment balances are included in long-term investments. For equity investments under the fair value option, the change in fair value of
the investment is included in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net and investment balances are included in long-term investments,
other than our equity interest in Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) which is included in the short-term assets section on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet. Investments in entities where we hold less than a 20% ownership interest are generally accounted for as equity investments to be
measured at fair value or, under an election, at cost if it does not have readily determinable fair value, in which case the carrying value would be
adjusted upon the occurrence of an observable price change in an orderly transaction for identical or similar instruments or impairment.
Upon the transfer of our Classifieds business to Adevinta in 2021, shares in Adevinta were included as part of total consideration received
under the definitive agreement. The equity interest in Adevinta is accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, upon completion of the sale
of 80.01% of the outstanding equity interests of eBay Korea LLC (“eBay Korea”) to Emart Inc. (“Emart”) in 2021, we retained 19.99% of the
outstanding equity interests of the new entity, Gmarket, which is accounted for under the fair value option. Subsequent changes in fair value for
these equity investments are included in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our consolidated statement of income.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have
evaluated all subsequent events through the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. In the opinion of management,
these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for
the fair statement of the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for these interim periods.
Significant Accounting Policies
There were no significant changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in “Note 1 — The Company and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for our policy related to revenue recognition
to reflect the expansion of promoted listing services offered to sellers beginning in the second quarter of 2023, as noted below.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when we transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequently
remitted to governmental authorities.
Our net revenues primarily include final value fees and promoted listing fees from sellers on our platforms. Our net revenues also include
store subscription and other fees often from large enterprise sellers as well revenues from the sale of advertisements and revenue sharing
arrangements. Our net revenues are reduced by incentives, including discounts, coupons and rewards, provided to our customers.
We identified one performance obligation to sellers on our Marketplace platform, which is to connect buyers and sellers on our secure and
trusted Marketplace platforms, including payment processing activities. Final value fees are recognized when an item is sold on a Marketplace
platform, satisfying this performance obligation. Services may also be provided to sellers to promote their listings through on-site or off-site
sponsored ads that are a distinct performance obligation for which revenue is recognized when (or over the period) these services are performed.
Store subscription and other nonstandard listing contracts may contain multiple performance obligations, including discounts on future
services. Determining whether performance obligations should be accounted for separately or combined may require significant judgment. The
transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). In instances where SSP is not directly
observable, we generally estimate selling prices based on when they are sold to customers of a similar nature and geography. These estimates are
generally based on pricing strategies, market factors, strategic objectives and observable inputs. Store subscription revenues are recognized over
the subscription period, and discounts offered through store subscription or nonstandard listing contracts are recognized when the options are
exercised or when the options expire.
Further, to drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, discounts on
items sold, coupons and rewards. Evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer may require significant judgment.
Promotions and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later of when revenue is
recognized or when we pay or promise to pay the incentive. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace platforms, to whom we
have no performance obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, we may provide credits to customers when we refund
certain fees. Credits are accounted for as variable consideration at contract inception when estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized
when a performance obligation is satisfied to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur and updated as
additional information becomes available.

Table of Contents
eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Advertising revenue is derived principally from the sale of online advertisements which are based on “impressions” (i.e., the number of times
that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) or “clicks” (which are generated each time users on our platforms click
through our advertisements to an advertiser’s designated website) delivered to advertisers. We use the output method and apply the practical
expedient to recognize advertising revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. For contracts with target advertising commitments
with rebates, estimated payout is accounted for as a variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not
occur.
Revenues related to revenue sharing arrangements are recognized based on whether we are the principal and are responsible for fulfilling
the promise to provide the specified services or whether we are an agent arranging for those services to be provided by our partners. Determining
whether we are a principal or agent in these contracts may require significant judgment. If we are the principal, we recognize revenue in the gross
amount of consideration received from the customer, whereas if we are an agent, we recognize revenue net of the consideration due to our partners
at a point in time when the services are provided. Our most significant revenue share arrangements are with shipping service providers. We are
primarily acting as an agent in these contracts and revenues are recognized at a point in time when we have satisfied our promise of connecting the
shipping service provider to our customer.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance to clarify the fair value measurement guidance for equity
securities subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security. Further, the guidance introduces new disclosure
requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value. The standard will be effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of
this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 — Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options and equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The
calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive shares of common stock.
The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated (in millions, except per

Acquisition of TCGplayer
In 2022, we completed the acquisition of TCGplayer, a trusted marketplace for collectible card game enthusiasts. In the first quarter of 2023,
we recorded measurement period adjustments related to the revised valuation of the intangible assets acquired. The following table presents the
revised allocation of the aggregate purchase consideration (in millions):
TCGplayer
Goodwill $ 148 
Purchased intangible assets 109 
Deferred taxes (18)
Total $ 239 
The goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of TCGplayer. We generally do not
expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition. Separate operating
results and pro forma results of operations for the acquisition above have not been presented as the effect of this acquisition is not material to our
financial results.

We consider cash to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. Restricted cash is held in interest bearing accounts for
letters of credit related to our global sabbatical program and for certain amounts related to other compensation arrangements held in escrow. Our
fixed-income investments consist of predominantly investment grade corporate debt securities and government and agency securities. The
corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on their credit ratings from the
major rating agencies.
The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As interest
rates increase, those securities purchased at a lower yield show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. The unrealized losses are primarily due to
changes in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative
and quantitative criteria. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value with changes reflected in other
comprehensive income. Where there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire impairment is
recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security. From time to time, we sell available-for-sale
debt securities in an unrealized loss position and recognize an immaterial loss.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We regularly review investment securities for credit impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In making this assessment, we
consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse
conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash
flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows
expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through
interest and other, net for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not
been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. We did not recognize any credit-related
impairment through an allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2023.
Investment securities in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months had an estimated fair value of $1.6 billion and unrealized losses of
$2 million as of June 30, 2023, and an estimated fair value of $2.8 billion and unrealized losses of $32 million as of December 31, 2022. Investment
securities in a continuous loss position for greater than 12 months had an estimated fair value of $1.3 billion and unrealized losses of $77 million as

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Upon completion of the transfer of our Classifieds business to Adevinta in 2021, we received an equity investment of 44% in Adevinta valued
at $10.8 billion at the close of the transfer. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of approximately 135 million of our voting shares in
Adevinta to Permira, inclusive of the option exercised by Permira to purchase additional voting shares, for total cash consideration of approximately
$2.3 billion which reduced our ownership in Adevinta to 33%. We have a contractual requirement to retain at least 25% of the total number of issued
and outstanding equity securities of Adevinta until October 14, 2023, subject to certain exceptions specified in the agreement. As of December 31,
2022 and June 30, 2023, our equity investment in Adevinta is reported in the short-term assets section on the condensed consolidated balance
sheet since our contractual requirement ends within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
At the initial recognition of the equity investment, we elected the fair value option where subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings. The investment is classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation can be obtained from real time quotes in active
markets. The fair value of the equity investment is measured based on Adevinta’s closing stock price and prevailing foreign exchange rate at each
balance sheet date and the changes in fair value are reflected in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in the condensed consolidated
statement of income. We believe the fair value option election creates more transparency of the current value in the equity investment in Adevinta.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, unrealized losses of $210 million and $36 million, respectively, were recorded in gain
(loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated statement of income related to the change in fair value of the
investment compared to $829 million and $2,472 million of unrealized losses recorded during the same periods in 2022. The fair value of the
investment was $2,656 million and $2,692 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation can be
obtained from real time quotes in active markets. Subsequent changes in fair value are reflected in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant,
net in the condensed consolidated statement of income.
The fair value of the equity investment in KakaoBank Corp. (“KakaoBank”) is measured based on closing stock price and prevailing foreign
exchange rate at each balance sheet date. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, unrealized losses of $4 million and $7 million,
respectively, were recorded in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated statement of income related to the
change in fair value of the investment compared to $105 million and $196 million of unrealized losses recorded during the same periods in 2022.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we sold a portion of our shares in KakaoBank for $242 million and $287 million, respectively,
and recorded realized losses on the change in fair value of shares sold of $67 million and $75 million, respectively, in gain (loss) on equity
investments and warrant, net. The fair value of the investment was $97 million and $104 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively, and is reported within short-term investments in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
We entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that vests in a series of four tranches, at a
specified price per share upon meeting processing volume milestone targets on a calendar year basis. When a relevant milestone is reached, the
warrant becomes exercisable with respect to the corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025.
We met the processing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant and in the third quarter of 2022, we sold the remainder of our
shares in Adyen. Refer to “Note 7 — Derivative Instruments” for more information about the warrant.

Equity investments under the fair value option
We account for equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the fair
value option or under the equity method. Our equity investment in Gmarket and certain other immaterial equity investments are accounted for under
the fair value option.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of 80.01% of the outstanding equity interests of eBay Korea to Emart. Upon completion
of the sale, we retained 19.99% of the outstanding equity interest of the new entity, Gmarket, over whom we are able to exercise significant
influence based on the terms of the securities purchase agreement, including through our board representation. Our equity investment in Gmarket
was valued at $728 million as of the transaction close date. At the initial recognition of this equity investment, we elected the fair value option where
subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in the condensed consolidated statement of
income. We believe the fair value option election creates more transparency of the current value in the equity investment in Gmarket. Our retained
investment in Gmarket is subject to a two year right held by Emart to purchase the remaining interest at or near the closing price of the sale.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, unrealized losses of $29 million and $40 million, respectively, were recorded in gain (loss)
on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated statement of income related to the change in fair value of the investment
compared to $77 million and $259 million of unrealized losses recorded during the same periods in 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, the fair value of the investment was $391 million and $431 million, respectively, and is reported within long-term investments in our
condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The investment is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management’s estimate of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the equity investment. Certain other immaterial equity investments aggregating to $40 million and $30 million as of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical
expedient, and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to “Note 8 — Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for more
information.
Other equity method investments
We account for equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the fair
value option or under the equity method. For equity investments accounted for under the equity method, our consolidated results of operations
include, as a component of interest and other, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments. For equity investments accounted
for under the fair value option, the change in fair value is included in our consolidated results of operations as a component of gain (loss) on equity
investments and warrant, net.

Note 7 — Derivative Instruments
Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate and
interest rate movements. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.
We use foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities, including intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one month to one year in duration but
with maturities up to 24 months. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows
are not adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign
exchange contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges on a quarterly basis.
In 2022, we entered into derivative instruments to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuance using
forward-starting interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps effectively fixed the benchmark interest rate and had the economic effect of hedging
the variability of forecasted interest payments for up to ten years on an anticipated debt issuance. Similar to other cash flow hedges, we recorded
changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) until the anticipated debt issuance. As
described in “Note 9 — Debt,” in 2022, we issued $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes, which consisted of notes maturing in 2025, 2027 and 2032.
As a result, we terminated the interest rate swaps and the gain associated with the termination of approximately $25 million is amortized to interest
expense over the term of our notes due in November 2032.
Cash Flow Hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI
and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted hedged transaction affects earnings. Derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the
initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative
instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings. As of June 30, 2023, we have estimated that approximately $16 million of net derivative
losses related to our foreign exchange cash flow hedges and $8 million of net derivative gains related to our interest rate cash flow hedges included
in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. We classify cash flows related to our cash flow hedges as operating activities in
our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.
Non-Designated Hedges
Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary
assets or liabilities, including intercompany balances and equity investments denominated in non-functional currencies. The gains and losses on
our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in interest and other, net, which are offset by the foreign currency gains and
losses on the related assets and liabilities that are also recorded in interest and other, net. We classify cash flows related to our non-designated
hedging instruments in the same line item as the cash flows of the related assets or liabilities, which is generally within operating activities in our
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash flows related to the settlement of non-designated hedging instruments related to equity
investments are classified within investing activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

Warrant
We entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions,
entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrant
has a term of seven years and vests in a series of four tranches, at a specified price per share (fixed for the first two tranches) upon meeting
processing volume milestone targets on a calendar year basis. When or if a relevant milestone is reached, the warrant becomes exercisable with
respect to the corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025. The maximum number of tranches
that can vest in one calendar year is two.
 
The warrant is accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. We report the warrant at fair value within other
assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and changes in the fair value of the warrant are recognized in gain (loss) on equity
investments and warrant, net in our condensed consolidated statement of income. The day-one value attributable to the other side of the warrant,
which was recorded as a deferred credit, is reported within other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is amortized over the
life of the commercial arrangement. See “Note 8 — Fair Value Measurements” for information about the fair value measurement of the warrant.

present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, the
potential effect of rights of set-off associated with the foreign exchange contracts would be an offset to both assets and liabilities by $26 million,
resulting in net derivative assets of $43 million and net derivative liabilities of $4 million. As of June 30, 2023, there was no potential effect of rights
of set-off associated with the interest rate contracts as there were no asset positions.

Notional Amounts of Derivative Contracts
Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as
the basis on which the value of foreign exchange payments under these contracts are determined. The following table presents the notional

Credit Risk
Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to
mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss
with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. To further limit credit risk, we also enter into
collateral security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fair
value of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgrade
by either party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral related to our foreign exchange derivative transactions.

Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1), less active markets (Level 2) and little or
no market activity (Level 3). Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving
identical assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments
in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations typically reflect management’s estimate of
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We did not have any transfers of financial instruments between
valuation levels during the six months ended June 30, 2023.
Other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value
because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
Fair value measurement of derivative instruments
The majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs
where applicable, such as equity prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency rates. Our warrant, which is accounted for as a
derivative instrument, is valued using a Black-Scholes model. Key assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates, Adyen’s
common stock price, equity volatility and common stock outstanding, exercise price, and details specific to the warrant. The value is also probability
adjusted for management’s assumptions with respect to vesting of the remaining three tranches which are each subject to meeting processing
volume milestone targets. These assumptions and the probability of

Fair value measurement of equity investments
Certain equity investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including our equity investment in Adevinta, equity investments
with readily determinable fair values and equity investments under the fair value option.
Our equity investment in Adevinta is accounted for under the fair value option and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the
fair value is measured based on Adevinta’s closing stock price and prevailing foreign exchange rate at each balance sheet date. Our equity
investments with readily determinable fair values are also classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation can be obtained from
real time quotes in active markets.
Our equity investment in Gmarket is accounted for under the fair value option and is subject to a two year right held by Emart from the date of
disposal to purchase the remaining interest at or near the closing price of the sale.

Senior Notes
In January 2023, we redeemed the $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the floating rate and 2.750% senior notes due 2023. Total cash
consideration paid was $1.2 billion, as the redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid
interest on the principal amount.
In 2022, we redeemed the $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2.600% and 3.800% senior notes due 2022. Total cash consideration
paid was $1.4 billion, as the redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the
principal amount.
In 2022, we issued senior notes of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount, which consisted of $425 million of 5.900% fixed rate notes due
2025, $300 million of 5.950% fixed rate notes due to 2027 and $425 million of 6.300% fixed rate notes due 2032.
We may redeem some or all of the fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, generally at a
make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest.(1)

If a change of control triggering event (as defined in the applicable senior notes) occurs with respect to the 3.450% fixed rate notes due 2024,
the 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025, the 5.900% fixed rate notes due 2025, the 1.400% fixed rate notes due 2026, the 3.600% fixed rate notes
due 2027, the 5.950% fixed rate notes due 2027, the 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030, the 2.600% fixed rate notes due 2031, the 6.300% fixed
rate notes due 2032, the 4.000% fixed rate notes due 2042, or the 3.650% fixed rate notes due 2051, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer
to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued includes customary covenants that, among other things and subject to
exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions
with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default with customary grace periods in certain circumstances, including
payment defaults and bankruptcy-related defaults.
To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, during the second quarter of 2020, we entered into interest rate swap
agreements that effectively converted $400 million of our LIBOR-based floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. During the first quarter of 2023 we
terminated the interest rate swap agreements upon redemption of the floating rate senior notes due 2023. During 2022, we entered into derivative
instruments to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuance using forward-starting interest rate swaps. As
described above, in 2022 we issued $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes, which consisted of notes maturing in 2025, 2027 and 2032. As a result,
we terminated the interest rate swaps and the gain associated with the termination of approximately $25 million is amortized to interest expense
over the term of our notes due in November 2032.
The effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of
any original issue discount and premium on these senior notes. Interest on these senior notes is payable either quarterly or semiannually. Interest
expense associated with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, was approximately $64 million and $55 million during
the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $131 million and $115 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and
2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of these senior notes, using Level 2 inputs, was
approximately $6.9 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively.
Commercial Paper
We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity
of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.

Credit Agreement
In March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year credit facility. We may also, subject to
the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1 billion. Funds borrowed under the
credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
As of June 30, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have an up to
$1.5 billion commercial paper program and are required to maintain available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repay
commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due, in an aggregate
amount of $1.5 billion. As of June 30, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under our commercial paper program; therefore, $2 billion of borrowing
capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. The credit agreement
includes a covenant limiting our consolidated leverage ratio to no more than 4.0:1.0, subject to, upon the occurrence of a qualified material
acquisition, if so elected by us, a step-up to 4.5:1.0 for the four fiscal quarters completed following such qualified material acquisition. The credit
agreement includes customary events of default, with corresponding grace periods in certain circumstances, including payment defaults, cross-
defaults and bankruptcy-related defaults. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including
restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. The credit agreement
also contains customary representations and warranties.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants in our outstanding debt instruments during the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Contract Balances
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Accounts receivable represents amounts invoiced and
revenue recognized prior to invoicing when we have satisfied our performance obligation and have the unconditional right to payment. The
allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience,
the age of the accounts receivable balances, current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other factors that may affect
our customers’ ability to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits was $43 million and $42 million as of June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, we reported an allowance for doubtful accounts of $18 million reflecting an increase of
$2 million, net of write-offs of $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we reported an allowance for doubtful
accounts of $16 million.
Deferred revenue consists of fees received related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period. Due to the generally short-
term duration of contracts, the majority of the performance obligations are satisfied in the following reporting period. The amount of revenue
recognized for the six month period ended June 30, 2023 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was $31
million. The amount of revenue recognized for the six month period ended June 30, 2022 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the
beginning of the period was $37 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect
on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. This arrangement allows for cash
withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate
Cash Deposits”). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The
net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest
expense or income under the arrangement. As of June 30, 2023, we had a total of $175 million in aggregate cash deposits and $8 million in
aggregate cash withdrawals held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.
Litigation and Other Legal Matters
 
Overview
We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an
indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the
estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in
our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the
low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of
losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot
estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the
materiality of a proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-
monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a
material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Overview, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or
range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.
Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the six months ended
June 30, 2023. We have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings
(i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and
regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a
reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reporting
period could be material. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

General Matters
Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We
are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we could be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our
business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against us
and/or against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased
exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the
past been forced to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our business
(both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations) and become subject to laws in jurisdictions
where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. We
believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectual property
claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing
business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms.
From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our
users (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,
rules, policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such practices,
prices, rules, policies or agreements. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as the political and
regulatory landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and
services that we offer and our geographical operations) and our products and services have increased in complexity. Any claims or regulatory
actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages for
certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement,
require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of
significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business.
From time to time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies, typically for potential
misconduct by sellers on the Company’s Marketplace platforms. More recently, the Company has received subpoenas or requests for information
from government agencies related to potential liability of the Company for products sold by sellers on the Marketplace platforms. The Company
generally responds to government subpoenas and requests in the ordinary course of business and in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner.
These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company.
In this regard, the Company has responded to inquiries from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) regarding products sold on the
Marketplace platforms alleged to violate certain laws and regulations, including regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and,
separately, regulations of the Drug Enforcement Agency. The inquiries relate to whether and to what extent the Company should be liable for the
sale of regulated or illicit products manufactured and sold by others who listed such products on Marketplace platforms in a manner that evaded
and/or was designed to evade detection by the Company. With respect to the inquiries regarding EPA regulations, the EPA, DOJ and the Company
have begun discussions relating to allegations of noncompliance arising under the Clean Air Act, among other alleged violations, which discussions
include a potential settlement. If the Company is found to be liable for such activities on the Marketplace, it likely will be subject to monetary
damages, changes in our business practices, or other remedies that could have a material adverse impact on our business.
The Company is also responding to inquiries from the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts regarding potential criminal liability of
the Company arising from the stalking and harassment in 2019 of the editor and publisher of Ecommercebytes, a website that publishes
ecommerce news and information. Six former Company employees and one former contractor have pleaded guilty to crimes arising from the
conduct. The Company has
36
Table of Contents
eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
begun discussions with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which discussions include a potential settlement. We expect any such settlement may include
fines, other payments, and non-monetary remedies, such as additional remediation, compliance and reporting requirements. Although the Company
has concluded that losses in the U.S. Attorney matter are probable, we are unable at this time to estimate the losses that may be incurred because
the matter is still under investigation and involves open questions relevant to the Company’s potential liability for conduct of its former employees.
The editor and publisher also have a pending civil action against the Company, which seeks unspecified damages arising from the above-described
conduct.
In connection with the government matters and civil action described above, the Company to date has accrued for probable losses of
approximately $64 million in the aggregate. Given the uncertainties involved, the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in additional
losses that may be material to our financial results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed
and the level of our net income or loss for that period.
Indemnification Provisions
We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship
of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,
which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our
indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These
agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become
subject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which
we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under
these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to
the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide
indemnification for intellectual property infringement. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification
provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To
date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either
individually or collectively.

Note 12 — Stockholders’ Equity
Stock Repurchase Program
Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,
subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our
outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block
trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as
management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be
limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors,
including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of
our cash.
The following table summarizes stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs for the period indicated (in millions, except
per share amounts):

Note 14 — Income Taxes
We are subject to both direct and indirect taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are under examination by
certain tax authorities for the 2010 to 2021 tax years. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may
ultimately result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for tax
years after 2009 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and California), Germany, India, Israel, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
 
Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross
unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination
and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized
tax benefits.
We have recognized the tax consequences of all foreign unremitted earnings and management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest
the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of the balance sheet date. We have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis
differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated to unremitted earnings. These basis differences will be indefinitely
reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis difference is not practicable.
We have recognized the tax consequences of all foreign unremitted earnings and management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest

$292 million and $526 million, respectively, of our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was included in other liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheet. We have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that
are unrelated to unremitted earnings. These basis differences will be indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes

OVERVIEW
 
Business
eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace platforms. Founded in 1995 in San Jose, California, eBay is one of
the world’s largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Collectively, we connect millions of buyers and
sellers around the world, empowering people and creating opportunity. Our technologies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and a
breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime and anywhere. In 2023,
we are focused on our strategic playbook — to understand the customer and their needs; build experiences they will love, at scale; and tell our
story in new and different ways.
In 2022, and extending into the second quarter of 2023, we experienced reduced traffic in most markets resulting from geopolitical events,
inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility and lower consumer confidence. These factors negatively impacted discretionary consumer
spending, are uncertain in duration and we expect them to continue throughout 2023.

Presentation
In addition to the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP
measures in reviewing our financial results. The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed
below are non-GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Accordingly, the FX-Neutral information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
information provided below in “Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance,” which includes reconciliations of FX-Neutral financial measures to
the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign
currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.
Quarter Highlights
Net revenues increased 5% to $2,540 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily
due to the investment in focus categories and higher take rate as a result of the expansion of promoted listings, international shipping and payment
services. The increase in net revenues was partially offset by a reduction in traffic in most markets resulting from geopolitical events, inflationary
pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility and lower consumer confidence during the three months ended June 30, 2023. FX-Neutral net revenues
(as defined above) increased 6% during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Operating margin decreased
to 20.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 21.7% for the same period in 2022.
We generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $605 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $577
million in the same period in 2022.
We recorded unrealized losses of $214 million in aggregate in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed
consolidated statement of income during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $1,221 million of realized and unrealized losses
recorded during the same period in 2022.
During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we paid $250 million cash for the purchase of common stock and paid $133 million in cash
dividends.
In July 2023, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock to be paid on September 15, 2023 to stockholders of
record as of September 1, 2023.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We have one reportable segment to reflect the way management and our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) review and assess
performance of the business. Our reportable segment is Marketplace, which includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized
counterparts and the eBay suite of mobile apps. The accounting policies of our segment are the same as those described in “Note 1 — The
Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Net Revenues
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, we present revenues generated from our Marketplace GMV and from non-GMV based businesses as
“Net revenues” in order to more closely align our presentation of net revenues with how our business is operated. We formerly presented such
amounts as “Net transaction revenues” and “Marketing services and other (MS&O) revenues,” and those line items for such prior periods have been
conformed to current period presentation. Consolidated net revenues are unchanged.
Net revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, fees to promote listings, payment service fees, listing fees, and store
subscription fees from sellers on our platforms. Our net revenues also include revenues from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharing
arrangements and shipping fees. Our net revenues are reduced by incentives, including discounts, coupons and rewards, provided to our
customers.
The following table presents net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

Net revenues $ 2,540 $ 2,422 5 %$ 5,050 $ 4,905 3 %
Seasonality
We expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to trend with general consumer buying patterns and expect that these trends will
continue. As we introduce and scale new products throughout the year, we expect net revenues to fluctuate. In addition, macroeconomic conditions,
including the impact of COVID-19, disrupted seasonal patterns in net revenues, particularly in the first quarter of 2021. The following table presents
our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of these net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

Revenues are attributed to U.S. and international geographies primarily based upon the country in which the seller, platform that displays
advertising, other service provider or customer, as the case may be, is located. The following table presents net revenues by geography for the
periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound
and euro. Year-over-year appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar may have a material impact to our financial results, and we have seen
elevated foreign currency volatility that we expect to continue throughout 2023. Through our hedging programs, we actively monitor foreign
currency volatility and attempt to mitigate the risk. As shown in the table above, we generate approximately half of our net revenues internationally.
Because of these factors, we are subject to the risks related to doing business in foreign countries as discussed in “Part I - Item 1A: Risk Factors” of
the 2022 Form 10-K.
Net revenues included $14 million and $43 million of hedging gains during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to
$9 million and $15 million of hedging gains during the same periods in 2022. Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had an
unfavorable impact of $9 million and $54 million on net revenues during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to an unfavorable
impact of $95 million and $153 million on net revenues during the same periods in 2022. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements
during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar against the British pound while the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during the six months ended June 30, 2023
compared to the same periods in 2022 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and euro.
Key Operating Metrics
Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net revenues.
GMV consists of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our platforms during the applicable period inclusive of
shipping fees and taxes. Despite GMV’s divergence from revenue, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the
overall volume of paid transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period.
Take rate is defined as net revenues divided by GMV and represents net revenues as a percentage of overall volume on our
platforms. We believe that take rate provides a useful measure of our ability to monetize volume through marketplace services on
our platforms in a given period. We use take rate to identify key revenue drivers on our marketplace.

during the same periods in 2022.
(2) Take rate is defined as net revenues divided by GMV, as discussed above.
Net revenues increased primarily due to the investment in focus categories and higher take rate as a result of the expansion of promoted
listings, international shipping and payment services. The increase in net revenues was partially offset by a reduction in traffic in most markets
resulting from geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility and lower consumer confidence, which negatively impacted
discretionary consumer spending during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.
Net revenues increased despite lower GMV during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the
benefit of a higher take rate during the same periods, as discussed above. We expect the divergence between net revenues and GMV to continue
throughout the year. Despite GMV’s divergence from net revenues, we still believe the metric provides a useful measure of overall volume of paid
transactions that flow through the platform in a given period.
Cost of Net Revenues
Cost of net revenues represents costs associated with customer support, site operations and payment processing. Significant components of
these costs primarily consist of employee compensation including stock-based compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of
equipment and amortization expense, bank transaction fees, credit card interchange and assessment fees, authentication costs, shipping costs and
digital services tax. The following table presents cost of net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

Cost of net revenues, net of immaterial hedging activities, increased during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same

the expansion of authentication services.
Cost of net revenues, net of immaterial hedging activities, increased during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same

expansion of authentication services, and a $12 million increase in customer support costs, partially offset by a $11 million decrease in payment
processing costs incurred and a $15 million favorable impact of foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.(1)

Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of $11 million and $41 million on operating expenses during
the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to a favorable impact of $53 million and $81 million during the same periods
in 2022. Hedging activity within operating expenses was immaterial during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), employee
compensation including stock-based compensation, certain user coupons and rewards, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on
equipment. Online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display
advertising. Offline advertising primarily includes brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.
Sales and marketing expenses were flat during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 with a
$15 million increase in employee related costs offset by an $8 million decrease in professional service fees and a $6 million favorable impact of
foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was
primarily due to a $41 million increase in employee related costs and a $37 million increase in advertising and marketing program costs (both online
and offline), partially offset by a $16 million decrease in professional service fees and a $25 million favorable impact of foreign currency movements
relative to the U.S. dollar.
Product Development
 
Product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation including stock-based compensation, contractor costs, facilities
costs and depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major platform and other product
development efforts, including the development and maintenance of our technology platform. Our top technology priorities include the
implementation of our strategic plan including payment intermediation capabilities, improved seller tools and buyer experiences.
The increase in product development expenses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022
was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs as we continue to innovate and modernize the shopping experience across our
platforms powered by intelligent computing at scale.
49
Table of Contents
Capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $28 million and $58 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to $30 million and $62 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. These costs are primarily reflected as a
cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
General and Administrative
 
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation including stock-based compensation, contractor costs,
facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums
and other professional service fees. Our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially
from period to period.
The increase in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022
was primarily due to an $11 million increase in employee related costs and a $10 million increase in professional service fees.
The increase in general and administrative expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was
primarily due to $41 million of restructuring costs that did not occur in the same period in 2022, a $28 million increase in employee related costs and
a $20 million increase in professional service fees.
Provision for Transaction Losses
Provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, losses from our
managed payments services, fraud and bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. We expect our provision for
transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.
The decrease in provision for transaction losses during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was
primarily due to $13 million lower bad debt expense.

Gain (Loss) on Equity Investments and Warrant, Net
Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net primarily consists of gains and losses related to our various types of equity investments,
including our equity investments in Adevinta, KakaoBank and Gmarket, and gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received
from Adyen. The following table presents gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net for the periods indicated (in millions, except

** Not meaningful
The change in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the
same periods in 2022 was primarily driven by the change in the fair value of our equity investments in Adevinta, Gmarket and KakaoBank and the
fair value of warrant.
Interest and Other, Net
 
Interest and other, net primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as foreign exchange
transaction gains and losses, gain/loss on acquisitions or disposals and interest expense, consisting of interest charges on any amounts borrowed
and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial
paper, if any. The following table presents interest and other, net for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):
 Three Months Ended

Total interest and other , net $ (19) $ (31) (39)%$ (45) $ (81) (44)%
Percentage of net revenues (1)% (1)% (1)% (2)%
Interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on corporate debt and government and agency securities in a higher interest rate
environment. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2023.
Interest expense increased primarily due to higher rates offset by lower average notional on outstanding debt during 2023. In 2023, we repaid
two tranches of senior notes at substantially lower interest rates than the senior
51
Table of Contents
notes that were issued during the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result, we expect continued upward pressure on interest expense throughout 2023.
Income Tax Provision
The following table presents provision (benefit) for income taxes for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):
 Three Months Ended

Income tax provision (benefit) $ 113 $ (191) $ 274 $ (501)
Effective tax rate 39.7 % 26.3 % 27.0 %  21.1 %
The increase in our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was primarily
due to an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions relative to total income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes in 2023, offset by
the 2022 deduction related to the closure of our marketplace in Turkey.
We are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have been
reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although there are inherent uncertainties in these examinations.
Due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments. However, we expect
several tax examinations to close within the next twelve months. See “Note 14 — Income Taxes” to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next twelve months.
Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we
use FX-Neutral net revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing our
financial results. We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-
over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts,
excluding hedging activity.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be
different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of
operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with
the corresponding GAAP measures.
These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for
the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the
foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we have
historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in our
financial reporting.

Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 402 $ 366 
 
Continuing Operating Activities
Our operating cash flows arise primarily from cash received from our customers on our platforms offset by cash payments for sales and
marketing, employee compensation and payment processing expenses.
Cash provided by continuing operating activities of $1,446 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to cash provided by
continuing operating activities of $1,206 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to working capital movements and
changes in non-cash items during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.
Continuing Investing Activities
Cash provided by continuing investing activities of $424 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to proceeds
of $8,382 million from the maturities and sales of investments, partially offset by cash paid for investments of $7,687 million and property and
equipment of $245 million.
The largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our
investments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.
Continuing Financing Activities
Cash used in continuing financing activities of $1,458 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to debt
repayments of $1,150 million related to the redemption of our floating rate and 2.750% senior notes due 2023, cash paid to repurchase $492 million
of common stock, and $267 million paid in cash dividends, partially offset by net funds receivable and payable activity of $562 million driven by
changes in payment processors.
The negative effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar against other currencies during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term
non-equity investments from continuing operations, in an aggregate amount of $5.3 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. We had an additional $380
million and $69 million, respectively, of cash proceeds, related to marketplace activity and held on behalf of customers, which we recorded
separately on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts and funds receivable. We believe these assets together with cash
expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to
capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our material cash requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.
54
Table of Contents
However, geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility and global economic uncertainty have caused material
disruptions in both U.S. and international financial markets and economies and are uncertain in duration. The impact of these events has increased,
and may continue to increase, our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. The future impact of these events cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure that we will have access
to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience other liquidity issues going forward.
Senior Notes
In January 2023, we redeemed the $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the floating rate and 2.750% senior notes due 2023. Total cash
consideration paid was $1.2 billion, as the redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid
interest on the principal amount.
As of June 30, 2023, we had fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion, with none payable within 12
months. The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, capital
expenditures, share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions.
Commercial Paper
We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity
of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of June 30, 2023, there were no commercial
paper notes outstanding.
Credit Agreement
In March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year credit facility. We may also, subject to
the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1 billion. Funds borrowed under the
credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2023, no
borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement.
Credit Ratings
As of June 30, 2023, we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term
rated A-2, with a stable outlook) and Moody’s Investor Service (long-term rated Baa1, short-term rated P-2, with a stable outlook). We disclose
these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs
depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as described above, will likely
increase our borrowing costs.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the six months ended June 30, 2023. For
additional details related to our debt, please see “Note 9 — Debt” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Income Taxes
As of June 30, 2023, our assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments included
assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $2.4 billion. As we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we will be required to
pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs.
We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.
During the first quarter of 2023, the IRS provided tax relief for the California winter storms, as a result, we have deferred our 2023 quarterly
federal cash tax payments until the fourth quarter of 2023.

Income Taxes” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Stock Repurchases
Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,
subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our
outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be funded from our working capital or other financing
alternatives.
We expect to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock, subject to market conditions and other
uncertainties. However, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number
of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and
management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. 
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately $500 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase
programs. As of June 30, 2023, a total of approximately $2.3 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock
repurchase programs. See “Note 12 — Stockholders’ Equity” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more
information about our stock repurchase programs.
Dividends
The Company paid a total of $133 million and $121 million in cash dividends during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, and $267 million and $250 million in cash dividends during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In July 2023,
our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock to be paid on September 15, 2023 to stockholders of record as
of September 1, 2023.
Other Capital Resource Requirements
We actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of
principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various
counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. To date, we have not
experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no
assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial
markets, including, without limitation, as a result of the impact of geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, lower consumer spending and foreign
exchange rate volatility. At any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with
third party financial institutions.
We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. As of June 30, 2023, we had a total of $175
million in aggregate cash deposits and $8 million in aggregate cash withdrawals held within the financial institution under the cash pooling
arrangement. See “Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for
more information about our cash pooling arrangement.
We have entered into various indemnification agreements and, in the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification
provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential
loss under these various indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification
provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively. See “Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies” to the condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our indemnification provisions.

Item 3:    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. In addition, adverse economic conditions and events
(including volatility or distress in the equity and/or debt or credit markets) may impact regional and global financial markets. These events and
conditions could cause us to write down our assets or investments. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from adverse economic
conditions and events or changes in interest rates.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly
increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our cash equivalents, customer accounts and short-term and long-term investments in a
variety of asset types, including bank deposits, government bonds and corporate debt securities. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 29% of our
total cash and investments was held in cash and cash equivalents and customer accounts. As such, changes in interest rates will impact interest
income. As discussed below, the fair market values of our fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may
suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.
 
As of June 30, 2023, the balance of our corporate debt and government bond securities was $3.0 billion, which represented approximately
34% of our total cash and investments. Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of
interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general,
fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities
generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest
rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment income may fall
short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. A
hypothetical 1% (100 basis point) point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of $20
million and $22 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Further changes in interest rates will impact interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bear interest at
floating rates, and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and,
accordingly, will impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, see “Note 9 — Debt” to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this report.
Equity Price Risk
Equity investments
In 2021, we completed the transfer of our Classifieds business to Adevinta. Upon completion of the transfer we received an equity interest in
Adevinta. The equity investment is accounted for under the fair value option and changes in Adevinta’s stock price and equity volatility may have a
significant impact on the value of our equity investment in Adevinta. As of June 30, 2023, a one dollar change in Adevinta’s common stock, holding
other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the investment by approximately $404 million.
The fair value of our equity investment in KakaoBank is measured based on closing stock price and prevailing foreign exchange rate at each
balance sheet date. Valuation of equity investments with readily determinable fair values can be obtained from real time quotes in active markets.
Changes in KakaoBank’s stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of our equity investment in KakaoBank. As of
June 30, 2023, a one dollar change in KakaoBank’s common stock, holding other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the
investment by approximately $5 million.
Our remaining equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. Our consolidated results of operations include, as a
component of gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for under
the equity method of accounting, or the change in fair value of the equity method investments accounted for under the fair value option. Equity
investments without readily determinable fair values are accounted for at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable
57
Table of Contents
price changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. Such changes in the basis of the
equity investment are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net. Equity investments under the fair value option are measured
at fair value based on a quarterly valuation analysis and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects
management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment. Subsequent changes in fair value are
recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net.
As of June 30, 2023, our equity investments totaled $3.3 billion, which represented approximately 37% of our total cash and investments, and
primarily related to our equity investment in Adevinta.
For additional details related to these investments, please see “Note 6 — Investments” to our condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this report.
Warrant
We entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions,
entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. As
discussed above, in 2021 we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant, and we exercised the option to
purchase shares of Adyen. The remaining tranches of the warrant are accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives
and Hedging. Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of the warrant. As of
June 30, 2023, a one dollar change in Adyen’s common stock, holding other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the
warrant by approximately $0.2 million. For additional details related to the warrant, please see “Note 7 — Derivative Instruments” to our condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the
British pound and euro, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various
foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of
intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow and results of operations that are exposed to
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency
fluctuations and related hedging activities.
We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these
exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the
purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts is
at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see “Note 7
— Derivative Instruments” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.
We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.
Most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss
is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same
period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative’s gain
or loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible for
cash flow hedge accounting.
58
Table of Contents
The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and foreign exchange
contracts not designated for hedge accounting and the before-tax effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange
rates that existed as of June 30, 2023. The sensitivity for foreign currency contracts is based on a 20% adverse change in foreign exchange rates,
against relevant functional currencies.
 Fair Value
Asset/(Liability) Fair Value Sensitivity
(In millions)
Foreign exchange contracts - Cash flow hedges $ 32 $ (103)
Foreign exchange contracts - Not designated for hedge accounting $ 7 $ (117)
Since our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes in
the value of the underlying exposure.
We also use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements
on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other, net, which are
offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts.
We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in
exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on
income before income taxes of approximately $11 million as of June 30, 2023 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange
forwards in place as of June 30, 2023.

(1)Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other
factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase
programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at
times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. These stock repurchase programs have
no expiration from the date of authorization.
During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately $250 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of June 30, 2023, a total
of approximately $2.3 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs.
We expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, our stock
repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors,
including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. 
(2)Excludes broker commissions and excise tax accruals.
Item 3:    Defaults Upon Senior Securities
Not applicable.
Item 4:    Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable.
Item 5:    Other Information
On May 12, 2023, Eddie Garcia, our Senior Vice President, Chief Product Officer, adopted a written trading plan intended to satisfy the
affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (a “10b5-1 Plan”), which is designed to be in effect until May 10, 2024,
subject to customary exceptions. His 10b5-1 Plan calls for the sale of a percentage of shares that he could receive upon the future vesting of
certain outstanding equity awards, net of any shares withheld by us to satisfy applicable taxes. The number of shares to be withheld, and thus the
exact number of shares to be sold pursuant to Mr. Garcia’s 10b5-1 Plan, can only be determined upon the occurrence of the future vesting events.
For purposes of this disclosure, without subtracting any shares to be withheld upon future vesting events, the aggregate number of shares to be
sold pursuant to Mr. Garcia’s 10b5-1 Plan is 18,476.
On May 16, 2023, Cornelius Boone, our Senior Vice President, Chief People Officer, adopted a 10b5-1 Plan, which is designed to be in effect
until December 29, 2023, subject to customary exceptions. His 10b5-1 Plan calls for the sale of a percentage of shares that he could receive upon
the future vesting of certain outstanding equity awards, net of any shares withheld by us to satisfy applicable taxes. The number of shares to be
withheld, and thus the exact number of shares to be sold pursuant to Mr. Boone’s 10b5-1 Plan, can only be determined upon the occurrence of the
future vesting events. For purposes of this disclosure, without subtracting any shares to be withheld upon future vesting events, the aggregate
number of shares to be sold pursuant to Mr. Boone’s 10b5-1 Plan is 15,682.(2) (1)

1.06    Interest Rates; LIBOR Benchmark  Notification  The interest rate on a Loan denominated in
U.S. Dollars or any Foreign Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the
future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators  have signaled the need to use alternative
benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate
benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable Laws, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis
on which they are calculated  may change. The London interbank of fered rate is intended to represent the rate
at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank
market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would
no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark
Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator , the “ IBA”) for purposes
of the IBA  setting the London interbank of fered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the
London interbank of fered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate
reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on LIBOR Loans. In light of this eventuality , public
and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to
be used in place of the London interbank of fered rate. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event
or an Early Opt-In Election , Section 3.03(b)  provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of
interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower , pursuant to Section 3.03(b) , of any
change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans is based. However , the
Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for , and shall not have any liability with
respect to, the administration, submission , performance  or any other matter related to the London interbank
offered rate or the  other rates in the definition of “LIBO Rate” or “EURIBO Rate” any inter est rate used in
this Agreement  or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof ,
(including,  without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate  implemented pursuant
to Section 3.03(b) , whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in
Election, and (ii) the implementation of  any Benchmark  Replacement  Conforming Changes pursuant to
Section 3.03(b) ), including, without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such
alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or
economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or the EURIBO Rate existing inter est rate being r eplaced  or have
the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank of fered any existing inter est rate prior to its
discontinuance or unavailability . The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates and/or  other  related entities
may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any inter est rate used in this Agreement or
any alternative, successor  or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement ) and/or  any
relevant adjustments ther eto, in each case, in a manner  adverse to the Borr ower . The Administrative
Agent may select information sour ces or  services in its r easonable discr etion to ascertain any inter est
rate used in this Agreement, any component ther eof, or  rates r eferenced in the definition ther eof, in
each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borr ower ,
37[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
any Lender  or any other  Person for damages of any kind, including direct or indir ect, special,
punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether  in tort, contract or
otherwise and whether  at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such  rate (or
component ther eof) pr ovided by any such information sour ce or  service.
1.07    Divisions  For all purposes under this Agreement, in connection with any division or plan of
division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a dif ferent jurisdiction’ s laws): (a) if any asset,
right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a dif ferent
Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person,
and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been or ganized
and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its capital stock or similar equity interests at
such time.

multiple of the Borrowing Multiple for such currency in excess thereof, or if the remaining amount available
under the Commitments shall be less than the Dollar Amount of the Borrowing Minimum for such currency ,

(iii)    Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due
interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
(c)    Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder
42[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after
the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law .
2.07    Fees.
(a)    Commitment Fee . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each
Lender , a commitment fee (the “ Commitment Fee ”) equal to the Applicable Rate times  the actual daily
amount by which the Commitment of such Lender exceeds such Lender ’s Outstanding Amount. The
Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period , including at any time during which
one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on
the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December , commencing with the first such date
to occur after the Closing Date , and ending on the last day of the Availability Period . The Commitment Fee
shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter ,
the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period
during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in ef fect.
(b)    Other Fees . (i) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts
and on the dates set forth in any fee agreements with the Administrative Agent and to perform any other
obligations contained therein.
(ii)    The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed
upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.
(c)    Fees Generally . All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in U.S. Dollars, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of Commitment Fees,
to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
2.08    
 Computation of Interest and Fees . All computations of interest for ABR Loans , when the
ABR is determined by reference to the Prime Rate , and for  Daily Simple SONIA  Loans  shall be made on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day). All computations of interest for  Borrowings denominated in Pounds Sterling
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365  days, and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but  excluding the last day). All other computations of fees and interest shall
be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day) (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-
day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on
a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is repaid, provided  that any
Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a) , bear interest for
one day . Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error . Any change in the interest rate on a Loan
resulting from a change in the ABR shall become ef fective as of the opening of business on the day on which
such change becomes ef fective. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower or the
applicable
43[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
Designated Borrower , as applicable, and the relevant Lenders of the ef fective date and the amount of each
such change in interest rate.
2.09    Evidence of Debt . The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more
accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of
business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be
conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower or a
Designated Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing
so shall not, however , limit or otherwise af fect the obligation of any of the Borrower and the Designated
Borrowers hereunder to pay any amounts owing by them with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any
conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall
control in the absence of manifest error . Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative
Agent, each of the Borrower and the Designated Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender
(through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender ’s Loans in addition to such
accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if
applicable), currency , amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
2.10    Payments Generally; Administrative Agent ’s Clawback .
(a)    General . All payments to be made by the Borrower or a Designated Borrower shall be made
without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setof f. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all payments by each of the Borrower and the Designated Borrowers hereunder
shall be made to the Administrative Agent , for the account of the Lenders to which such payment is owed, at
the Administrative Agent’ s Office and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. Local Time on
the date specified herein; provided  that payments pursuant to Sections 2.07(b)(i) , 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 11.04
shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its applicable share of each payment received for the accounts of the Lenders in like funds as
received by wire transfer to such Lender ’s Lending Of fice (and if at any time insuf ficient funds are received
by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due
hereunder , such funds as are received shall be applied towards payment of the amounts then due hereunder
ratably among the parties entitled thereto, in accordance with the amounts then due to such parties ). All
payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. Local Time shall be deemed received on the
next Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by
the Borrower or a Designated Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day , payment shall
be made on the next following Business Day , except as otherwise set forth in the definition of “Interest
Period” or “Maturity Date”, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as
the case may be. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan , and all other payments
hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in U.S. Dollars . Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Borrowing in any Foreign Currency ,
currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such Foreign Currency
with the result that such Foreign
44[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
Currency no longer exists or the Borrower or the applicable Designated Borrower , as the case may be, is not
able to make paym ent to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Foreign Currency ,
then all payments to be made by the Borrower or such Designated Borrower hereunder in such Foreign
Currency shall instead be made when due in a currency that replaced such Foreign Currency or, if no such
replacement currenc y exists, in U.S. Dolla rs in an amount equal  to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of
repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower or such
Designated Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
(b)    Funding by Lenders ; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender ’s share of such Borrowing , the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section
2.02 and may , in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower or the applicable
Designated Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of
the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent , then the applicable Lender and the
Borrower or the applicable Designated Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower or such Designated
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent , at (i) in the case of a payment to
be made by such Lender , the rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules and conventions on interbank compensation (or , if such payment is in U.S. Dollars, if greater ,
the NYFRB Rate), plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily char ged by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the
Borrower or such Designated Borrower , the interest rate applicable to the applicable Loan or , if such
payment is in U.S. Dollars, ABR Loans . If the Borrower or such Designated Borrower and such Lender shall
pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower or such Designated Borrower the amount of such interest paid
by it for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent ,
then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender ’s Loan included in such Borrowing . Any payment by
the Borrower or a Designated Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower or such
Designated Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the
Administrative Agent . A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender , the Borrower or any Designated
Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this clause (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error .
(c)    Payments by Borrower or any Designated Borrower ; Presumptions by  Administrative Agent .
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower or the applicable Designated
Borrower , as applicable, prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower or such Designated Borrower will not make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Designated Borrower has made
such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may , in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to
the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower or such Designated Borrower has not in fact
45[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in immediately available funds with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date
of payment to the Administrative Agen t, at the rate determi ned by the Administrative Agen t in accorda nce
with bank ing indust ry rules and conve ntions on interbank compensation (or, if such payment is in U.S.
Dollars, if greater , the NYFRB Rate) , plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily
charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. Any payment by any Lender
pursuant to this clause (c) shall be without prejudice to any claim such Lender or the Administrative Agen t
may have against the Borrower or the applicable Designated Borrower , as applicable, for having failed to
make such payment to the Administrative Agent . A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender , the
Borrower or any Designated Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this clause (c) shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error .
(d)    Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative
Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article
II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower or the applicable Designated Borrower , as
applicable, by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowings set forth in
Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall
return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender ) to such Lender within one Business Day ,
without interest.
(e)    Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not
joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan , to make any payment under Section 11.04(c)  or 11.05 or
to purchase any participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its
corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to so make its Loan , to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section
11.04(c)  or 11.05.
(f)    Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has
obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner .
2.11    Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setof f or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans
made by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such
Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase (for
cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall
be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans, provided  that:
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
recovery , without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall not be constru ed to apply to (x)
any payment made by the Borrower or any Designated Borrower
46[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as in
effect from time to time), including payments pursuant to Sections 2.12  and 3.02, or
(y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which
the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply). Each of the Borrower and the Designated Borrowers
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
Lender acquiring a participation pursuan t to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower
and such Designated Borrower rights of setof f and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower or such Designated Borrower in the amount of such
participation.
2.12    Extension of Maturity Date .
(a)    Requests for Extension . The Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall
promptly notify the Lenders ) not earlier than 90 days and not later than 30 day s prior to any anniversary of
the Closing Date (each a “ Relevant Anniversary Date ”), but on not more than two occasions during the term
of this Agreement, request that each Lender consent to the extension of the Maturity Date for an additional
year from the Maturity Date then in ef fect hereunder (the “ Existing Maturity Date ”).
(b)    Lender Elections to Extend . Each Lender , acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by
notice to the Administrative Agent given not later than 20 days after receipt of the Borrower ’s request
pursuant to Section 2.12(a)  (the “ Extension Lender Response Date ”), advise the Administrative Agent
whether or not such Lender agrees to the requested extension; provided  that any Lender that does not so
advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Extension Lender Response Date shall be deemed to have
advised the Administrative Agent that it has declined to agree to the requested extension (each Lender that
agrees to the requested extension being referred as an “ Extending Lender ”, and each Lender that does not or
is deemed not to agree to the requested extension being referred to as a “ Non-Extending Lender ”). The
election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.
(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of
each Lender ’s determination (or deemed determination) under this Section 2.12  promptly after the Extension
Lender Response Date.
(d)    Additional Commitment Lenders . The Borrower shall have the right on or before the Existing
Maturity Date to replace each Non-Extending Lender with, and add as “ Lenders ” under this Agreement in
place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an “ Additional  Commitment Lender ”) as provided in
Section 11.13, each of which Additional Commitment Lenders shall have entered into an Assignment and
Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall undertake all or a portion of the
Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a
Lender , the Commitment so undertaken shall be in addition to such Lender ’s original Commitment
hereunder).
47[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
(e)    Minimum Extension Requirement . If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders
that have agreed so to extend their Maturity Date and the additional Commitments of the Additional
Commitment Lenders shall be more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect
immediately prior to the Relevant Anniversary Date , then, ef fective as of the Relevant Anniversary Date , the
Maturity Date applicable to each Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender (but not any
Non-Extending Lender) shall be extended to the first anniversary of the Existing Maturity Date (except that,
if such date is not a Business Day , such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the immediately preceding
Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a “ Lender ” for all purposes
of this Agreement .
(f)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions . As a condition precedent to the ef fectiveness of any
extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.12 , the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent a certificate dated as of the effective date of such extension signed by a Responsible Of ficer (i)
certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such extension
and (ii) certifying that, before and after giving ef fect to such extension, (A) the representations and
warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents that are qualified by materiality shall be
true and correct on and as of the date of such extension and after giving ef fect thereto, and such
representations and warranties that are not qualified by materiality shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the effective date of such extension , except, in each case, to the extent that such
representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date ( provided  that such materiality qualifier shall not be
applicable to any representation or warranty that already is qualified or modified by materiality in the text
thereof), and except that for purposes of this Section 2.12(f) , the representations and warranties contained in
clauses (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall, after the first delivery of financial statements pursuant to clauses (a)
and (b), respectively , of Section 6.01 , be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements so delivered ,
and (B) no Event of Default exists.
(g)    Non-Extending Lenders . On the Maturity Date applicable to each Non-Extending Lender that
has not been replaced as provided in Section 2.12(d) , the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender shall
terminate and each of the Borrower and the Designated Borrowers shall repay all Loans of such Non-
Extending Lender outstanding to it on such date, together with accrued interest thereon and all Commitment
Fees accrued hereunder for the account of such Non-Extending Lender .
(h)    Permitted Amendments; Conflicting Provisions . In connection with ef fecting the extension
requested pursuant to this Section 2.12 , the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may , without the consent
of any Lender other than the Extending Lenders and the applicable Additional Commitment Lenders, ef fect
such amendments to this Agreement as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent, to give ef fect to the provisions of this Section 2.12 . This Section 2.12  shall supersede
any provisions in Section 2.1 1 or 11.01 to the contrary .
48[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
2.13    Increase in Commitments .
(a)    Request for Increase . Provided there exists no Default , upon notice to the Administrative Agent
(which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower may from time to time request an increase in the
Commitments by an aggregate amount (for all such requests) not exceeding US$1,000,000,000; provided
that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of US$50,000,000 and (ii) the
Borrower may make a maximum of five such requests. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in
consultation with the Administrative Agent ) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is
requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than 10 Business Days from the date of delivery of
such notice to the Lenders ).
(b)    Lender Elections to Increase . Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such
time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to,
greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding
within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment .
(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders . The Administrative Agent shall
notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders ’ responses to each request made hereunder . To achieve
the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to
become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent and its counsel.
(d)    Increase Ef fective Date and Allocations . If the Commitments are increased in accordance with
this Section 2.13 , the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the ef fective date (the
“Increase Ef fective Date ”) and the final allocation of such increase among the Lenders . The Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the
Increase Ef fective Date .
(e)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase . As a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate dated as of the Increase Ef fective Date signed by a
Responsible Of ficer (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or
consenting to such increase and (ii) certifying that, before and after giving ef fect to such increase, (A) the
representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents that are qualified by
materiality shall be true and correct on and as of the Increase Ef fective Date , and such representations and
warranties that are not qualified by materiality shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of
the Increase Ef fective Date , except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to
an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date
(provided  that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representation or warranty that already
is qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), and except that for purposes of this Section
2.13(e) , the representations and warranties contained in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall, after the
first delivery of financial statements pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively , of Section 6.01 , be deemed
to refer to the most recent financial statements so delivered , and (B) no Event of Default exists. The
Borrower
49[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
and the Designated Borrowers shall prepay any Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay
any additional amounts required pursua nt to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding
Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percenta ges arising from any nonra table increase in the
Commitments under this Section 2.13 .
(f)    Conflicting Provisions . This Section 2.13  shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.11 or
11.01 to the contrary .
2.14    Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary , if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender , then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is
a Defaulting Lender:
(a)    Commitment Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such
Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.07(a) ; and
(b)    the Commitment and Outstanding Amounts of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether the Required Lenders or other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action
hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section
11.01); provided  that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or
all Lenders af fected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 1 1.01, require the consent of such
Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower agree that a Defaulting Lender has
adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender , then on such date such
Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall
determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided  that no adjustments will
be made retroactively with respect to Commitment Fees that did not accrue for the account of such Lender
while it was a Defaulting Lender , and all amendments, waivers and other modifications effected without its
consent in accordance with the provision s of Section 11.01 and this Section 2.14 during such period shall be
binding on it.
2.15    Determination of Dollar Amounts . The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar
Amount of each Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency:
(a)    as of the date of the commencement of the initial Interest Period therefor and as of the date of
the commencement of each subsequent Interest Period therefor; and
(b)    during the continuation of an Event of Default , on any other Business Day elected by the
Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Required Lenders .
Each day upon or as of which the Administrative Agent determines Dollar Amounts as described in the
preceding clauses (a) and (b) is herein described as a “Computation Date ” with respect to each Borrowing
for which a Dollar Amount is determined on or as of such day .
50[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
2.16    Judgment Currency . If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to
convert a sum due from the Borrower or a Designated Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be
payable herein (the “ specified currency ”) into another currency , the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent
that they may ef fectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which the Administrative
Agent could, in accordance with normal banking procedures applicable to arm’ s length transactions,
purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent’ s main New York City
office on the Business Day immediately preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given.
The obligations of the Borrower or the applicable Designated Borrower in respect of any sum due to any
Credit Party hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency ,
be dischar ged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Credit Party of any sum
adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Credit Party may in accordance with normal, reasonable
banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency . If the amount of the specified
currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Credit Party in the specified currency , the
Borrower or the applicable Designated Borrower , as applicable, agrees, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Credit
Party against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum
originally due to any Credit Party in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as
a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.1 1, such
Credit Party agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower or such Designated Borrower .
2.17    Appointment of Borrower as Agent . Each of the Designated Borrowers hereby
(a)    appoints the Borrower to act as its agent for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, including the giving and receipt of notices (including any Committed Loan Notice) and the
execution and delivery of all document s, instruments and certificates contemplated hereby or by any other
Loan Document, including any amendm ent, wavier or other modification to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, and (b) agrees that (i) the Borrower may execute such notices, documents, instruments and
certificates on behalf of such Designated Borrower as the Borrower deems appropriate in its sole discretion
and such Designated Borrower shall be obligated by all of the terms of any such notice document, instrument
or certificate executed on its behalf, (ii) any notice or communication delivered by the Administrative Agent
or a Lender to the Borrower shall be deemed delivered to each Designated Borrower and (iii) the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may accept, and be permitted to rely on, any notice, document,
instrument, certificate executed by the Borrower on behalf of any of the Designated Borrowers.
ARTICLE III. TAXES , YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
3.01    Taxes.
(a)    Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrower or a Designated Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and

that if the Borrower or such Designated Borrower shall be required by applicable Law to deduct or withhold
any Indemnified Taxes
51[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
(including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under

(c)    Indemnification by the Borrower or any Designated Borrower . The Borrower or the applicable
Designated Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender , within 30 days after
demand therefor , for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on amounts payable by the
Borrower or a Designated Borrower under any Loan Document or any Other Taxes (including Indemnified

[[6066768]]

Lenders, and, except for such consent rights, the Borrower and the Designate d Borrowers shall not have
rights as third-party  beneficiaries of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the
term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the
Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law, and instead such term is used as a matter of market
custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
9.02    Rights as a Lender . The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though
it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly

Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity . Such Person and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such
Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.

except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expres sly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders  as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan
Documents), provided  that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
opinion or the opini on of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to
any Loan Documen t or applicable Law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in
violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or
termination of property of a Defaulting  Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and (c) shall not,
except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall
not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is
communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any
capacity . The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the
consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary , or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary , under the
circumstances as provided in Sections 8.02 and 11.01) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross  negligence or
willful misconduct, with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until notice (stating that it is a “notice of default”) describing such
Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower , a Designated Borrower or a Lender . The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have
80[[5253476]]

with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (B) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or thereu nder or in connection herewith or therewith, (C) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the
occurrence of any Default, (D) the sufficiency , validity , enforceability , effectiveness or genuineness of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrumen t or document or (E) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivere d to the Administrative Agent or satisfaction of any condition that
expressly refers to the matters describ ed therein being acceptable or satisfa ctory to the Administrative
Agent.
9.04    Reliance by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon,
and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement,
instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website
posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise
authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in
the Loan Documents for being the signatory , sender or authenticator thereof). The Administrative Agent also
may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the
proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents
for being the maker thereof), and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance
with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of
a Lender , the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of
such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action
taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
9.05    Delegation of Duties . The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and
exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more
sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related
Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of
any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-
appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
selection of such sub-agents.
9.06    Resignation of Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice
of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower . Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the
Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a)  or
81[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]

guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the
Obligations of any Designated Borrower or any collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of of fset
with respect thereto at any time or from
87[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]

the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof; provided ,
further , that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments
from members of an Assignee Group to a single assignee (or to an assignee and members of its

under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower , the Designated Borrowers, the

Commitments, Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register ”); provided  that
no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Partic ipant Register to any Person
(including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’ s interest in any
obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that
such obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error , and such Lender shall treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all
purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary . For the avoidance of doubt, the
Administrative Agen t (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register
(e)    Limitations upon Participant Rights . A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01  or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with the Borrower ’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01  unless the Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and
97[[5253476]]

such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower and any Designated Borrower , to comply with
Section 3.01(e)  as though it were a Lender .

jurisdiction over it or any of its Affiliates (including any self-regulatory authority , such as the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) in any legal, judicial or administrative proceeding or in
accordance with a judicial or other governmental order , subpoena, interrogatory , discovery request,
investigative demand or other legal process or as required by applicable law or regulation (in which case the

Borrower the opportunity to seek confidential treatment of the information prior to such disclosure, to the
extent permitted by law), (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder , (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 1 1.07, to (i) any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this

For purpos es of this Section 11.07, “Information ” means all information received from the Borrower
or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrow er or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than
(i) any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary and (ii) information pertaining to this Agreement
routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the
lending industry , provided  that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiar y
after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential or should,
98[[5253476]]
[[6066768]]
because of its nature, reasonably be understood to be confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.07 shall be considered to have complied with
its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of
such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

include MNPI, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of MNPI and
(c) it will handle MNPI in accordance with applicable Law , including Federal and state securities Laws.

currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender to
or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Designated Borrower against any and all of the
obligations of the Borrower or any Designated Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document to such Lender , irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower
or any Designated Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or of fice of such
Lender dif ferent from the branch or of fice holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The
rights of each Lender under this Section 1 1.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setof f) that such Lender may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and, if applicable,
such Designated Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setof f and application,
provided  that the failure to give such notice shall not af fect the validity of such setof f and application.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setof f, (a) all
amounts so set of f shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such
Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent

to the extent lawful, the interest and Char ges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were
not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 1 1.09 shall be cumulated and the interest and Char ges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum
Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together

with interest thereon at the NYFRB Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender .
11.10    Counterparts; Integration; Ef fectiveness; Electronic Execution . (a) This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by dif ferent parties hereto in dif ferent counterparts), each of which shall

subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written,

import in or relating to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and the transactions contem plated hereby shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures,
deliveries or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect,

this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be af fected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties
shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with
valid provisions the economic ef fect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
11.13
