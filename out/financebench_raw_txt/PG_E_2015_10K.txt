ITEM
1.
BUSINESS  
PG&E Corporation, incorporated in Cal
ifornia in 1995, is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utilityoperating in northern and c
entral California.  The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905.  PG&E Corporation became the holding company of the Utility and itssubsidiaries in 1997.  The Utility g
enerates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’soperating revenues, incom
e, and total assets can be found below in Item 6. Selected Financ ial Data. 
The principal executiv
e offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O.   Box 770000, San Francisco, California   94177.  PG&ECorporation’s telephone numbe
r is (415) 973-1000 and the Utility’s telephone number is (415)   973-7000. 
At December 31, 2015, PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility had approximately 23,000 regular employees, approximately 20 of which were employees of the PG&ECorporation 
.  Of the Utility’s regular employees, approximately 13,500 are covered by collec tive bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor unions:  theInternational Brotherhood o
f Electrical Workers (“IBEW”); the Engineers and Scientists of California (“ESC”); and the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU” ).   TheSEIU collective bargaining 
agreement will expire on July 31, 201 6 . The two agreements with IBEW will expire on December   31, 201 6 .   The agreement with ESC, originallyscheduled to expire on Decemb
er 31, 2015, automatically renewed for a period of one year pending the negotiation of a new agreement with the union.  In January 2016, theUtility and ESC reached a tent
ative new agreement, subject to ratification by members of ESC.   If ratified, the new agreement with ESC will be retroactive to January 1, 2016and will expire on December 31, 
2019 .  
This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K fo
r PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Annual Reports on Form   10-K,Quarterly Reports on Form 
  10-Q, Current Reports on Form   8-K, and proxy statements, are available free of charge on both PG&E Corporation's website, www.pgecorp.com
 , and the Utility's website, 
www.pge.com
 , as promptly as practic able after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC .  The information contain ed on these websites is not part ofthis or any other report th
at PG&E Corporation and the Utility files with, or furnishes to, the SEC. 
In April 2015, the CPUC issued decisions in the thr
ee investigations that had been brought against the Utility relating to (1) the Utility’s safety record-keeping for itsnatural gas transmission sys
tem, (2) the Utility’s operation of its natural gas transmission pipeline system in or near locations of higher population density, and (3) the Utility’spipeline installat
ion, integrity management, record-keeping and other operational practices, and other events or courses of conduct, that could have led to or contributed to thepipeline accident th
at occurred in San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010 (the “San Bruno accident”).  A decision was issued in each investigative proceeding to determinethe violations that the Ut
ility committed.  The CPUC also approved a fourth decision (the “Penalty Decision”) to impose penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion .  For moreinformation 
about the Penalty Decision see Item 1.A. Risk Factors and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. below.   The Utility also faces criminal charges in 
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under theNatural Gas Pipeline Safety Act 
and that the Utility obstructed the N TSB ’s investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident.  T he trial currently is scheduled to begin onMarch 22, 2016.  F 
or more information about the criminal pro ceeding, s ee “Enforcement and Li tigation Matters” in MD&A , Item 1.A. Risk Factors, and Note 13 of the Notesto the Consolidated Financial St
atements in Item 8. below .  
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward
-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  For a discussion of the significantrisks that could affec
t the outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition and results of operations, see “Item1A. Risk Factors” and the section ent
itled “Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in MD&A. 
Regulatory
Environment

  
The Utility's business is subject 
to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.  At the state level, the Utility is regulatedprimarily by the CPUC.  At the federa
l level, the Utility is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements of other federal,state and local regul
atory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and health. This section and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms” section below summarize some of themore significant laws, r
egulations, and regulatory proc eedings affecting the Ut ility. 
7

 PG&E Corporation is a “public util
ity holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversight by theFERC.  PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries are 
exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than the obligation to provide accessto their books and records to th
e FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes. 
The
California
Public
Utilities
Commission
 
The CPUC consists of five members appoint
ed by the Governor of California and confirmed by the California State Senate for staggered six-year terms.  The CPUC hasjurisdiction over the r
ates and terms and conditions of service for the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution operations, electricity generation, and natural gastransmission and storage se
rvices.  The CPUC also has jurisdiction over the Utility's issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalfof the Utility's electricity a
nd natural gas retail customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities usedin providing electric and
 natural gas utility service.
The CPUC enforces state laws and regula
tions that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utility gasand electric facilities. 
  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $50,000 per day, per violation, for violations that occurred after January 1, 2012.  (The statutory maximumpenalty for violations th
at occurred before January 1, 2012 is $20,000 per violation.)  The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality ofthe circumstances, in
cluding such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the good faith of theentity charged in att
empting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to thesize of the entity cha
rged.   
As discussed above, i 
n April 2015, the CPUC concluded its three investigati ve enforcement actions against the Utility by imposing penalties totaling $1.6 bi llion. (For more information about 
the Penalty Decision , see Item 1.A. Risk Factors and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. below.) The CPUC is also conducting investigative
 enforcement proceedings relating to the Utility’s natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping practices and the Utility’s potential violations of theCPUC’s ex parte communication rul
es.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in MD&A for more information.) Further, in August 2015, the CPUC began an investigation into whether the organiza
tional culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability andachieve safety goals and s
tandards. (For more information, see “ Regulatory Matters ” in MD&A.) 
The CPUC has adopted separate gas and ele
ctric safety enforcement programs that authorize the SED to issue citations and impos e fines for violations of certainregulations. 
  Under both the gas and electric programs, the SED is required to impose the maximum statutory p enalty o f $50,000 for each separate violation and has the discretion to impose dai
ly fines for continuing violations.  During 2016, the CPUC is expected to develop and imp lement improvements and refinements to the electric and gassafety citation progr
ams, including steps to reconcile the differences between the two programs. 
The California 
State Legislature also dire cts the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to increasing renewable energy resources, thedevelopment and widespread dep
loyment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the development of energy storagetechnologies and facilities,
 and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  T he CPUC is responsible for approving funding and administration ofstate-mandated publi
c purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs.  The CPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Utility’s accounting,performance and compliance 
with regulatory guidelines .  
T 
he CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial conditionsthat require PG&E Corporation’s Boa
rd of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility'sobligation to serve or to ope
rate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in MD&A and Item 1A. RiskFactors.)

 The
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
and
the
Californ
ia
Independent
System
Operator 
The FERC has jurisdiction over the Util
ity's electricity transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectricgeneration facili
ties, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s transmission systems with othe r electricsystems and generation fa
cilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesale electricity sales.  The FERC also is charged with adopting and 
enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliability of the nation’s electricity transmission grid, including standards to prote ct the nation’sbulk power system against potent
ial disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC has authority to impose fines of up to $1 million per day for violation ofcertain federal s
tatutes and regulations. 
The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmiss
ion organization for the Utility’s service territory.  The CAISO controls the operation of the electricity transmission system in Cali
fornia and provides open access transmission service on a non - discriminatory basis.  The CAISO also is responsible for planning transmissionsystem additions, ensuring the 
maintenance of adequate reserves of generation capacity, and ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system is maintained. 
The
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
 
The NRC oversees the licensing, constru
ction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at DiabloCanyon and the Utility’s reti
red nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay.  (See “Electric ity Resources” below.)  NRC regulations require extensive monitoring and review ofthe safety, radiologic
al, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or to force ashutdown of a nuclear plant, or both.  NRC safe
ty and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capital expenditures at Diablo Canyon, and substantialcapital expenditures 
could be required in the future.   For more information about Di ablo Canyon, see “Regulatory Matters – Diablo Canyon” in MD&A and Item 1.A RiskFactors below.)
 
Other
Regulation

The CEC 
is the state's primary energy policy and planning agency.  The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.  TheCEC also is responsible for forec
asts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans.
The CARB is the state agency charged with s
etting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits.  The CARB also is responsible for adopting and enforcingregulations to implem
ent state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California.  (See “Environmental Regulation — Air Quality and Climate Change” below.) 
In addition, the Utility obt
ains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities, electricitytransmission lines, natur
al gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities.  The Utility also periodically obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses inconnection with distribution o
f electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for the operation of the Utility's business and toconduct certain related operatio
ns.  The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties that permit the Utility to install, operate, and maintain theUtility's electric and natural
 gas facilities in the public streets and highway s.  In exchange for the right to use public streets and highway s, the Utility pays annual fe es to thecities and counties.  I
n most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term, with no expiration date. 
Ratemaking
Mechanisms
 
The Utility’s rates for electricit
y and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service including areturn on invested capit
al (“cost-of-service ratemaking”).  Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount that the Utility willbe authorized to collect from
 its customers (“revenue requirements”).  The Utility’s revenue requ irements consist primarily of a base amount set to enabl e the Utility to recover its reasonable operat
ing expenses ( e.g., maintenance, adminis tration and general expenses) and capital costs ( e.g., depreciation, tax, and f inancing expenses).  In addition, theCPUC authorizes the Utility to coll
ect revenues to recover costs that it is allowed to “pass-through” to customers (referred to as “Uti lity Revenues and Costs that did not ImpactEarnings” in MD&A) 
, including its costs to procur e electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel, to administer public purpose and customer programs, and to decommission itsnuclear facilities.
 
9

 The Utility’s rate of r
eturn on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings.  The authorized rate of return on all other assets is set in theCPUC’s cost of capital proceeding.  Othe
r than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” from itssales volume.  Regulatory bal
ancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, ensure that the Utility will fully collect its authorized base revenue requirements.  TheUtility’s earnings prim
arily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impact ed Earnings” in MD&A) within its authorized base 
revenue requirements. 
Both gas and electric ra
tes vary depending on seasons mostly due to the influence of weather.  Gas service rates generally increase during the winter months (Octoberthrough March) to account fo
r the gas peak due to heating while electricity rates increase during summer (June – September) because of higher summer costs, driven by airconditioning loads.
 
During 2015, the CPUC continued to implement st
ate law requirements to reform residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of service,reduce cross-subsidizat
ion among customer rate classes, implement new rules and rates for net energy metering (which currently allow ce rtain self-generating customers toreceive bill cred
its for surplus power at the full retail rate) , and allow customers to have gr eater control over their energy use.  (See “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” inMD&A for additional informa
tion on specific CPUC proceedings . ) 
From time to time, the CPUC may use in
centive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues.  For exa mple, theUtility has earned incen
tives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.  (See “Results of Operations” in MD&A.)   These mechanisms can also createfinancial risk. 
  For a discussion of the re-opened proceeding to review incentive revenues awarded for the 2006-2008 energy efficiency cycle, see “Rehearing of CPUCDecisions Approving Energy Efficien
cy Incentive Awards” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. below. 
Base
Revenues

General
Rate
Cases

The GRC is the primary proceeding in whi
ch the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers torecover the Utility’s anticipate
d costs, including return on rate base, related to its electricity distribution, natural gas distribution , and Utility owned electricity generationoperations.  The CPUC generally conducts a 
GRC every three years.  The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year (or “test year”) of the GRC periodand 
typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases (known as “attrition rate adjustments”) in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period. Attrition rate adjustments are
 generally provided for cost increases related to increases in invested capital and inflation .  Parties in the Utility's GRC include the ORA andTURN, who generally represent the over
all interests of residential customers, as well as a myriad of other intervenors who represent residential and other customer interests. 
For more information about 
the Utility’s current GRC proceeding, see “ Regulatory Matters −2017 General Rate Case” in MD&A.
Natural
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Cases
 
The CPUC determines the Utility’s au
thorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.  In its 2015 GT&S rate case, 
the Utility has request ed that the CPUC approve a total annual revenu e requirement of $1.2 63 billion for the Utility’s anticipated costs of prov iding natural gastransmission and storage se
rvices for 2 015.  The Utility also requested revenue increases of $83 million in 2016 and $142 million in 2017. See “ Regulatory Matters – 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage 
Rate Case” in MD&A for additional information.

 Cost
of
Capital
Proceedings
 
The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of 
capital proceeding to authorize the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric and naturalgas distribution, and natura
l gas transmission and storage rate base.  The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital structure through 2017, consisting of 52% common equity,47% long-term debt, and 1% pr
eferred stock.  The CPUC also set the authorized ROE at 10.40%.  The CPUC also adopted an adjustment mechanism to allow the Utility’s capitalstructure and ROE to be adjusted i
f the utility bond index changes by certain thresholds on an annual basis.  During 2015, the adjustment mechanism was not triggered so theUtility’s authorized ROE will r
emain at 10.40% for 2016.  On February 12, 2016, a proposed decision was issued, th at, if approved by the CPUC, will preclude the Utility fromusing the mechanism befor
e its next cost of capital application.   As a result, if the proposed decision is approved, the Utility’s capital structure and ROE will not be adjusted for2017. 
  The CPUC will review the Utility’s capital st ructure and ROE for 2018 in the Utility’s next cost of cap ital proceeding.  The Utility is required to file its 2018 cost ofcapital applicat
ion by April 20, 2017 .

Rate
Cases

The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirement s , including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in ratesin the TO rate case.  The Util
ity generally files a TO rate case every year.  The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenuerequirement, subject 
to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision.  These FERC-approved rates are included : 1) by the CPUC in the Utility's retail electric rates and arecollected from retail electric customers 
; and 2) by the CAISO in its Transmission Access Cha rges to wholesale customers .  (See “ Regulatory Matters – FERC TO Rate Cases” in MD&A.)  The Utility also recove
rs a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts withwholesale transmission custo
mers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations.  These wholesale customers are charged individualized rates based on theterms of their contracts.

California investor-ow
ned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electricity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus appli cable reserve margins, that arenot satisfied from their o
wn generation facilities and existing electricity contracts.  The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources,including electricity procured
 from third parties or the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources are the least expensive (i.e., using the principlesof “least-cost dispat
ch”).  In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their procurement plans based on long-term demand forecasts.  T he CPUC hasapproved the 
Utility’s procurement plan covering 2012 through 202 4 . 
California law allows ele
ctric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved electricity procurement plans without further after-the-factreasonableness review 
by the CPUC .  The CPUC may disallow c osts associated with elec tricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approved plan or if the 
CPUC determines that the utility failed to fo llow the principles of least-cost dispatch.  
The Utility recovers its 
electricity procurement costs annually primarily through the en ergy resource recovery account .  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolida tedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.) Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility ’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments, GHGemissions costs, and generat
ion fuel expense, and approves a forecasted r evenue requirement.  The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s ret ail electricity rates more frequently if theforecasted aggregate over-collectio
ns or under-collections in the energy resource recovery account exceed 5% of its prior year electricity procurement and utility-ownedgeneration revenues.  The CPUC performs 
an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resource recovery account. 
The CPUC has approved various power purchase agre
ements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approvedprocurement plan, 
to meet mandatory renewable energy targets , and to comply with resource adequacy requi rements.  For additional informat ion, s ee “Electric Utility Operations – Electrici

 Natural
Gas
Procurement
and
Transportation
Costs
 
The Utility sets the 
natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecastedcosts of natural gas, core p
ipeline capacity and storage costs.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost of derivativeinstruments through its re
tail gas rates that are subject to limits as set forth in its  core procurement incentive mechanism, described below .  The Utility reflects the differencebetween actual natura
l gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing accounts, with under-collections and over-collections takeninto account in subsequent month
ly rate change s.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retailelectricity rates.
 
The 
core procurement incentive mechanism protects the Utility again st after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs.  Under the core procurement incentive mechanism 
, the Utility’s natural g as purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weighted average ofpublished monthly and daily natu
ral gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas.  Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to102% of the commodity benchm
ark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates.  One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark are recoverablein customers’ rates, and 
the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark. The Utility retains the 
remaining amount of savings as incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs.  While this mechanism remains inplace, changes in the 
price of natural gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income. 
The Utility incurs transpor
tation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers.  These providers transportnatural gas from the poin
ts at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States) to the points atwhich the Utility's natural g
as transportation system begins.   These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, and terms of service for theprovision of natural gas tr
ansportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines.  The FERC approves the United States tariffs that shippers , including the Utility, 
pay for pipeline service , and the applicable Canadi an tariffs are approved by the Alberta Utilities Commission and the National Energy Board.  The transportation coststhe Utility incurs under th
ese agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurement costs or as a cost of electricity. 
Costs
Associated
with
Public
Purpose
and
Customer
Programs

The CPUC authorizes the Utility to re
cover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utility customers.  
These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.   Additionally, the CPUC hasauthorized the Utility 
to provide a discount rate for low-income customers, known as California Alternate Rates for Energy (“CARE”), which is subsidized by the Utility’s othercustomers.

Nuclear
Decommissioning
Costs

The Utility's nuclear power f
acilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the saferemoval of nuclear facilities from 
service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the property forunrestricted use.  
Nuclear decommissioning cos ts are collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventualdecommissioning of each nuc
lear unit.  The Utility files an appl ication with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’s updated estimated decommissioning costs and 
any rate change necessa ry to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission the Utility’s nuclear plants. 
Electric
Utility
Opera
tions
The Utility generates e
lectricity and provides electricity transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California toresidential, commercial, industrial
, and agricultural customers.  The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) to most customersin its service terr
itory.  Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation resources, such as rooftopsolar installations.
 
12

 As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, 
the Utility filed its proposed electric distribution resources plan for approval by the CPUC. The Utility’s plan identifiesoptimal locations on its 
electric distribution system for deployment of distributed energy resources.  The Utility’s proposal is designed to allow energy technologies to beinterconnected with ea
ch other and integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  The Utility envisions afuture electric g
rid, titled the Grid of Things™, that would allow customers to choose new advanced energy supply technologies and services to meet their needs consistent withsafe, reliable and a
ffordable electric service.  The CPUC also is considering the Utility’s request for approval of the phased deployment of an electric vehicle charginginfrastructure in r
esponse to the CPUC’s December 2014 decision adopting a policy to expand the California utilities’ role in developing an EV charging infrastructure to supportCalifornia’s clima
te goals.  (For more information, see “ Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in MD&A.) 
Electricity

The Utility is required
 to maintain generating capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning andoperating reserves, delivera
ble to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service.  The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule all of theelectricity resources within it
s portfolio in the most cost-effective way .

 Renewable
Energy
Resources
.  California law established a “renewabl e portfolio standard” (referred to as “RPS”) that requires load-serving en tities, such as the Utility,to gradually increase 
the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their customers .  I n October 2015, the California Governor signed SB 350 , the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 
which, effective January 1, 2016, increases the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving entities, including the Utility, totheir customers from 33
% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030compliance period and in 
each compliance period thereafter.  SB 350 establishes increasing interim renewable energy targets for the periods between 2020 and 2030 but also provides 
compliance flexibility and waiver mechanisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to futurecompliance periods.  The Uti
lity will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets which the Utility expects will continue to berecoverable from cus
tomers as “pass-through” costs. The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets.  The CPUC has stated its intent to propose a decision in late 2016 imp
lementing SB 350’s provisions requiring higher RPS targets and other changes made by the statute to the RPS rules.   
Renewable generation resour
ces, for purposes of the RPS requirements , include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW or less),wind, solar, and geothermal en
ergy.  During 2015, 29.5 % of the Utility’s energy deliveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPS target of 23.3%. Approximately 2 
5 % of the renewable energy delivered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties.   Additional renewable resources were provided byQFs (3. 
0 %), the Utility’s small hydroelectric facilities (0. 7 %), and the Utility’s solar facilities (0. 4 %). 
The total 2015 renewable del

Storage.

As required by California law, th e CPUC has established initial energy storage procurement targets to be achieved by each load-serving entity, such asthe Utility.  The Utility mus
t hold Requests for Offers (RFOs) to meet bi ennial targets and procure 580 MW of energy storage which must be operational by the end of 2024. The Utility’s 2014-2015 energy stor
age procurement target was 80.5 MW.  The Utility in itiated its RFO on December 1, 2014 to obtain at least 74 MW o f transmission and distribution 
connected energy storage, s igned contracts for 75 MW, and submitted those contracts for CPUC approval on the CP UC’s December 1, 2015 deadline.  The Utility met its remaining 6.5 MW 
customer-connected target by funding energy storage under the CPUC-mandated Self Generation Incentive Program. On January 1, 2016, the Utilityreported its complian
ce with its 2014-2015 obligations to the CPUC.  The Utility must file its 2016-2017 plan for procuring 120 MW of energy storage, consisting of 105 MW oftransmission and distribut
ion energy storage and 15 MW of custo mer-connected storage, by March 1, 2016.  A CPUC decision on the Utility’s plan is expected before theDecember 1, 2016 deadline for 
the Utility to issue its second energy storage RFO.  The Utility continues to participate in the CPUC proceeding to refine California’s energystorage program, which is consid
ering potentially higher targets and expanded energy storage use cases.

Electricity
Transmission

  
At December 
  31, 201 5 , the Utility owned approximately 18, 4 00 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500kV.  The Utility also opera 
ted 91 electric tr ansmission substations with a capacity of approximately 63,400 MVA.  The Utility’s electric transmission system is interconnectedwith electric power syste
ms in the Western Electricity Coordinating Co uncil, which includes many weste rn states, Alberta and British Columbia, and parts of Mexico. 
In 2013, the Utility, MidAmeric
an Transmission, LLC, and Citizens Energy Corporation were selected by the CAISO to jointly develop a new 230-kV transmission lineto address the growing power demand in Fr
esno, Madera and Kings counties area.  The 70-mile line will connect the Utility-owned and -operated Gates and Gregg substations. The new line will help reduce 
the number and duration of power outages, improve voltage in the area, support economic development, and bolster efforts to integrate clean,renewable energy onto the gr
id.  The transmission line is expected to commence operations by 2022, and could come online earlier. 
Throughout 201 
5 , the Utility upgraded several critical substations and re-conductored a number of transmission lines to improve maintenance and system flexibility,reliability and saf
ety.  The Utility expects to undertake various additional transmission projects over the next several years to upgrade and expand the capacity of its transmissionsystem to accommodate sys
tem load growth, secure access to renewable generation resources, replace aging or obsolete equipment and improve system reliability.  The Utilityalso has taken steps to improv
e the physical security of its transmission substations and equipment. 
15

 Electricity
Distribution
 
The Utility's electri
city distribution network consists of a pproximately 142,000 circui t miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground andapproximately 80% are ov
erhead), 58 transmission switching substations, and 603 distribution substations, with a capacity of approximately 31,400 MVA.  The Utility’sdistribution network inter
connects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-voltage transmissio n voltages to lower voltages, r
anging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers. 
These distribution substations s
erve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network.  Emanating from each substation are primary and secondarydistribution lines connec
ted to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users.  In some cases, the Utility sellselectricity from its distribution
 facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.  In 2015 the Utility commenced op erations in a new electricdistribution control center 
facilit y in Rocklin , California, and expects to complete an additional facility in Concord, California, in 2016.  These control centers form a key part ofthe Utility’s efforts to create
 a smarter, more resilient grid. 
In 2015, the Utility continued to d
eploy its Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration circuit technology which involves the rapid operation of s mart s witchesto reduce the duration of 
customer outages.   Another 83 circuits were outfitted with this equipment, bringing the total deployment to 700 of the Utility ’s 3200 distribution circuits. 
  The Utility also installed o r replaced 20 distribut ion substation transformer banks to improve reliability and provide capacity to accommodate growing demand.   TheUtility pl

 Natural
Gas
Utility
Operations

  
The Utility provides
 natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,industrial, large commercial, an
d natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.   Core customers canpurchase natural gas procu
rement service (i.e. ,
 natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party ga s procurement service providers (referred to as coretransport agents). 
  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gas delivery, metering and billing services tocustomers. 
    When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combined service as “bundled” natural gas service.   Currently,more th 
an 91% o f core customers, representing n early 80% of the annual core marke t demand, receive bundled natural gas service from the Utility. 
The Utility does not provide procu
rement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers.  The Utility offers backbonegas transmission, gas delive
ry (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-core customers.   Access to the Utility'sbackbone gas transmission syste
m is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.   The Utility also delivers gas to off-system customers (i.e 
., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers. 
Natural
Gas
Supplies
 
The Utility can receiv
e natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and thesouthwestern United States.  The Util
ity also is supplied by natural gas fields in California.  The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customers directly from producersand marketers in both Canada 
and the United States.  The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gas purchase contracts have fluctuatedgenerally based on marke
t conditions.  During 201 5 , the Utility purchased appr oximately 307,100 MMcf o f natural gas (net of th e sale of excess supply of gas).  Substantiallyall this natural gas was pur
chased under contracts with a term of one year or less.  The Utility’s largest individual supplier represented approximately 17 % of the total natural gasvolume the Utility purchas
ed during 201 5 . 
Natural
Gas
System
Assets
 
The Utility owns and operates an in
tegrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California.  AtDecember 31, 201 
5 , the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 42, 800 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6, 7 00 miles of backbone and local transmissionpipelines, and various storag
e facilities.  The Utility owns and operates eigh t natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system and one small station on itslocal transmission syste
m that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines.  The Utility’s backbone trans mission system, composed primarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401,is used to transport gas from 
the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, and California gas fields to the Utility’s local transmissionand distribution systems.
 
The Utility has firm tr
ansportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA GasTransmission, 
  Ltd. and TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines   Ltd., B.C. System.  These companies’ pipeline systems connect at the border to the pipeline system owned by GasTransmission Northwest, LLC, which provides natu
ral gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system on the Oregon-California border near M
alin, Oregon.  The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline, LLC to transport this gas from the U.S Rocky Mountains to theinterconnection point with 
the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin, Oregon, at the California border, and firm transportation agreements withTranswestern Pipeline Company, LLC and El Paso Natu
ral Gas Company to transport this natural gas from supply points in the U.S. Southwest to interconnection points with theUtility's natural gas tr
ansportation system in the area of California near Topock, Arizona.  The Utility also has a transportation agreement with Kern River Gas TransmissionCompany to transport gas from th
e U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas system in the area of Daggett, California.  For moreinformation regarding 
the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The Utility owns and operates thr
ee underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to the Utility’stransmission system. 
  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for storage and laterwithdrawal. 
  In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system. 
17

 During 201 
5 , the Utility conducted an annual system-wide review of its transmission pipeline class location designations .  The Utility also continued work to install 217 
automatic and remote control shut-off valves on its gas transmission system , as specified in the eleventh of twelve sa fety recommendations made by the NTSB following itsinvestigation of the San Bruno ac
cident.  As of December 31, 2015, the Utility had installed 235 automatic and remote control shut-off valves , and the NTSB closed that recommendation 
.  The final safety recommendation, considered open and acceptable by the NTSB, involves hydrostatic testing nearly 1,000 miles of the Utility’s gastransmission system. 
  The Utility has completed the majority of this task and currently plans to complete the task for the remaining approximately 100 of pipelines (involving primarily short pipeline se
gments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmission pipelines) during 2018.   Also, as part of theUtility’s distribution in
tegrity management program, the Utility completed approximately 23,500 sewer inspections during 2015 to identify and correct conflicts between gas andwaste water facilities.

Competition

Competition
in
the
Electricit
y
Industry 
California law allows
 qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather thanfrom the utilities up to certai
n annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility.   T his arrangement is known as “direct access.”     In addition, Californialaw permits cities, countie
s, and certain other public agencies that have qualified to become a “community choice aggregator” (or “CCA”) to generate and/or purchase electricityfor their local res
idents and businesses.   By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents who do not affirmatively elect to continue to receive electricity from autility.
 
18

 The Utility continues to provid
e transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtainmetering and billing se
rvices from their energy service provider.  The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services from theUtility.  In addition to col
lecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect charges to recover thegeneration-relat
ed costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. The Utility remains the electricityprovider of last r 
esort for these customers.  
In some circumstances, gov
ernmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute to provide retailelectric service, may seek to ac
quire the Utility’s distribution facilities, either under a consensual transaction or via eminent domain. 
The Utility is also impac
ted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage.  The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarilysolar installations) and t
he use of customer net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing. 
The Utility also competes 
for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its service territorythrough a competitive bidd
ing process managed by the CAISO. 
Competition
in
the
Natural
Gas
Industry
 
The Utility primarily 
competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis oftransportation rates, access
 to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services.  The Utility also competes for storage serviceswith other third-party sto
rage providers, primarily in northern California.
Environmental
Regulation

The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health ofthe Utility's personnel and th
e public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and radioactive substances; thedischarge of pollutants in
to the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of carbon dio xide (CO ­ 2 ) and other GHG emissions; the transportation, handling, storage anddisposal of spent nuclear fu
el; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penalties for viola tion of these laws andrequirements can be sev
ere and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions.  These laws and requirements also may require the Utility, under certaincircumstances, to int
errupt or curtail operations.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)  Generally, the Utility recovers most of the costs of complying wi th environmental laws andregulations in the Utili
ty's rates, subject to reasonableness review.  Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subjectto a special ratem
aking mechanism described in Note 1 3 : Contingencies—Environmental Remediation Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.
 
Hazardous
Waste
Compliance
and
Remediation

The Utility's facilit
ies are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act o
f 1980 as amended.  The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted by the EPA, the federal agency responsible for implementing thefederal environment
al laws.  The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted by the State of California and various state and local agencies. These federal and stat
e laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1) owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companiesthat disposed of, or arranged 
for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in some cases, their corporate successors.  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act 
, these persons (known as “potentially responsible parties”) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardoussubstances, paying for the har
m caused to natural resources, and paying for the costs of required health studies. 
19

 The Utility has a comprehens
ive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  Under federal and Californ ia laws, the Utility maybe responsible for remed
iation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site.  The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen by the CaliforniaDepartment of Toxic Substances Cont
rol, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.  The Utility has incurredsignificant environmen
tal remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gas compressorstations are located, 
and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances.  Groundwater at the Utility’s Hinkley and Topocknatural gas compressor st
ations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices.  The Utility is responsible for remediating this groundwatercontamination and for ab
ating the effects of the contamination on the environment. 
For more information ab
out environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Air
Quality
and
Climate
Change
 
The Utility's electri
city generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws, including thefederal Clean Air Act, as wel
l as state and local statutes.  These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone,CO 
2 , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), mono-nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions. 
In December 2009, the EPA concluded tha
t GHG emissions contribute to climate change and issued a finding that GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollutionthat endangers public hea
lth and welfare.   In May 2014, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (a conf ederation of the research arms of thirteen federal departments andagencies) 
released its third National  Climate Assessment, which stated that the global climate is changing and that impacts related to climate change are already evident in manysectors and are expect
ed to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond. 
Federal
Regulation
.  At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.  Although there have been several legislativeattempts to address cl
imate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted.  In theabsence of federal l
egislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions. 
In August 2015, the EPA published final regula
tions under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act to control CO 2 emissions from new fo ssil fuel-fired power pl ants. While these regulat
ions do not affect the Utility’s existing power plants, the regulations impose emission limitations on fossil fuel-fired power plants constructed after January 8,2014 and will affect the des
ign, construction, operation and cost of such power plants.  
I 
n August 2015 , the EPA also published final regulations under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to control CO 2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired powerplants 
.  These regulations are des igned to reduce power plant CO 2 em issions on a national basis by as much as 32 % by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.  States must submitfinal plans to comply with th
e se regulations by September 2016, but may request an extension to file such plans until September 2018. It is uncertain whether and how thesefederal regulations wi
ll ultimately impact California, since existing state regulation currently requires, among other things, the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to1990 levels by 2020. 
  Following publication of the EPA’s regulations , in October 2015 West Virginia and severa l other states and parties challenged the EPA’s section 111(d)regulations in the United Sta
tes Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and petitioned the Court to stay the regulations pending review of the appeal on the merits. The D.C. Circuit denied the request 
for stay but in February 2016, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay of the section 111(d) regulations pending review of the appealby the D.C. Circuit.  The Supreme Court’s dec
ision may affect the nature, extent and timing of implementat ion of these regulations.  As described below, the Utility exp ects allcosts and revenues associat
ed with the state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers. 
20

 State
Regulation.

California ’s AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, p rovides for the gradual reduction of s tate-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by2020.  The CARB has approved various regulations 
to achieve the 2020 targe t , including GHG emissions reporting and a s tate-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program thatsets gradually declining 
limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of the economy.  The cap - and-trade program’s firs
t compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electricity generation and large industrial sectors.  The next compliance period, whichbegan on January 1, 2015, expanded to includ
e the natural gas and transportation sectors, effectively covering all the economy’s major sectors until 2020.  The Utility’scompliance obligation 
as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than naturalgas delivery customers th
at are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance obligation.  During each year of the program, the CARB issues emissionallowances (i.e., the righ
ts to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year.  Emitters can obtain allowances fro m the CARB at quarterly auctions orfrom third parties or 
exchanges.  Emitters may also satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductionsachieved by third parti
es (such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers) that occur outside of the emitters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such asreforestation or biom
ass projects.  During 2016, CARB and the California Legislatur e are likely to consider proposals to achieve additional GHG reductions beyond the 2020target established in AB 32.  
The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers.  The California RPSprogram that requires 
the utilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG emissions in California.
Climate
Change
Mitigation
and
Adaptation
Stra
tegies.
During 201 5 , the Utility continued its programs to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the Utility’soperations (including custo
mer energy usage) on the environment and to plan for the actions that it will need to take to adapt to the likely impacts of climate change on theUtility’s future operation
s.  The Utility regularly reviews the most relevant scientific literature on climate change such as sea level rise, temperature changes, rainfall and runoffpatterns, and wildfire r
isk, to help the Utility identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary adaptation strategies.  The Utility maintains e mergencyresponse plans and procedures to 
address a range of near-term risks, including extreme storms, heat waves and wildfires and uses its risk-assessment process to prioritizeinfrastructure investments for
 longer-term risks associated with climate change. The Utility also engages with l eaders from business, government, academia, and non-profitorganizations to share in
formation and plan for the future. 
With respect to electric operation
s, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demand due tomore extreme, persis
tent, and frequent hot weather.  The Utility believes its str ategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficien cy and demand response programs,infrastructure imp
rovements, and the use of rene wable energy and energy storag e are effective strategies for adaptin g to the expected increase in demand for electricity.  The Utility is making su
bstantial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather and related emergencies.   The Utility’svegetation management activities al
so reduce the risk of wildfire impacts on electric and gas facilities.  Over the long-term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and inundation 
potential at coastal and lo w elevation facilities due to sea level rise combined with high tides, storm runoff and storm surges. 
Climate scientists a
lso predict that climate change will result in significant reductions in snowpack in parts of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  This could, in turn, affectthe Utility’s hydroelec
tric generation.  To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and is also adopting strategies such asmaintaining higher winte
r carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and collaborating on resea rch and new modeling tools.  
With respect to natur
al gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane into theatmosphere.  The Utility has 
taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reduce the pressure andvolume of natural gas within p
ipelines prior to venting.   In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in metha ne emissions by implementing improvements in leakdetection and repair, up
grades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipeline materials.

 Emissions
Data

PG&E Corporation and the Utility tr
ack and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas.  The Utility reports its GHGemissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a vo
luntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The Climate Registry, a non-pro 
fit organization.  The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2014 totaled more than 58 milli on metric tonnes of CO ­ 2equivalent 
, nearly two-thirds of which came fro m customer natural gas use.  The following t able shows the 201 4 GHG emissions data the Utility reported to the CARB underAB 32 
. PG&E Corporation and the Utility publish additional GHG emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

Since the Utility purchases a portion of its electricity from the wholesale market, the Utility is not able to track some of its delivered electricity back to a specific generator.  Therefore, there is someunavoidable uncertainty in the Utility’s emissions rate.

Water
Quality
 
On May 19, 2014, the EPA issued final regulations 
to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electricpower plants, suc
h as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.   Various industryand environmental groups have 
challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  California’s once-through coolingpolicy discussed below is consider
ed to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations.  Therefore, California’s implementation process for the state policy will likelycontinue without any signific
ant change. 
22

 At the state level, 
  in 2010 the California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or othersignificant measures to red
uce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.   As required by the policy the California WaterBoard 
appointed a committe e to evaluate the feasibility and cost of using alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon.   The committee’s consultantsubmitted its final r
eport to the California Water Board in September 2014 and the board is not expected to issue a final decision regarding Diablo Canyon’s compliance with thestate policy 
before January 2017 .  If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible,the Utility may be forc
ed to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge.   Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incursignificant costs to comp
ly with alternative compliances measures or to make payments to support various environmental mitigation projects. The Utility would seek to recoversuch costs in rates.  The Utili
ty’s Diablo Canyon operations must be in compliance with the California Water Board’s policy by December 31, 2024. 
The final requiremen
ts of the federal and state cooling water policies could affect future negotiations between the Central Coast Board and the Utility regarding thestatus of the 2003 settlem
ent agreement.  (See “Diablo Canyon Power Plant” in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.) 
Nuclear
Fuel
Disposal
 
Under the Nuclear Waste Poli
cy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts under whichthe DOE would be required to dispose of the u
tilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the utilities’ customers. The DOE has been unable to meet its 
contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and theretired nuclear f
acility at Humboldt Bay.  As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at HumboldtBay until the DOE fulfills its con
tractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel.  The Utility and other nuclear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs thatthey incurred to constr
uct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. 
In September 2012, the U.S. Department o
f Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that awarded the Utility $266 million for spent fuel storage costsincurred through December 31, 2010.  Th
e settlement agreement also provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requests for reimbursement of its ongoingspent fuel storage costs.  In 
2015 , the Utility was awarded an addi tional $ 21 million for costs incurred between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014 .  The claim for the period June1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 
is under review by the DOE.  These proceeds are being r efunded to customers through rates.  The settlement agreement, as amended, does notaddress costs incurred for sp
ent fuel storage beyond 2016 and such costs could be subject to future litigation.  Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when andwhether the DOE will meet its con
tractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.23

 ITEM
1A.
RISK
FACTORS

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial results can be affected by many factors , including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policiesdescribed in MD&A, 
that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical resu lts or from anticipated future financial results .   T he followingdiscussion of key 
risk factors should be conside red in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financia
l statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K .  Any of these factors , in whole or in part, 
could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s bus iness, results of operations , financial condition, a nd stock price.

may
be
materially
affected
by
the
outcome
of
the
federal
criminal
prosecution
of
the
Utility.

As discussed in MD&A, the 
Utility is facing federal criminal  charges alleging that the Utility knowingly and willful ly violated minimum safety standards under theNatural Gas Pipeline Safety Act 
and alleging t hat the Utility illeg ally obstructed the NTSB’s investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident that occurred on September 9, 2010 
.  The maximum statutory f ine for each felony count is $500,000, for potential total fines of $ 6.5 million.  The federal prosecutor also seeks to impose an alternative fine 
which could total approximately $ 562 m illion , b ased on allegations that the Utility derived gross gains of approximately $281 million .  The trial currently is scheduled to begin 
on March 22 , 2016. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
have not recorded any charg es for potential criminal fines in their consolidated f inancial statements at Decemb er 31, 2015.  If theUtility is convicted and a 
fine is imposed, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will record charges when requ ired in accordance with GAAP.  The Utility also could incurmaterial costs, not r
ecoverable through rates, to implement remedial measures that may be imposed by the court, such as a requirement th at the Utility’s natural gas ope rationsbe supervised by a third-par
ty monitor . The Utility could also be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs. 
If the Utility incurr
ed material fines or costs following a conviction, PG&E Corporation may need to issue common stock to raise funds to contribute to the Utility tomaintain the requir
ed equity component of the Utility’s authorized capital structure as the Utility incur charges and costs.  These issuances would be incremental to PG&ECorporation’s current for
ecast of common stock issuances and could materially dilute PG&E Corporation’s EPS.  The trial and any negative publicity associated with it, as wellas the Utility’s convict
ion and the imposition of a material fine, if incurred, also could affect the Utility’s and PG&E Corporation’s credit ratings or outlooks and make it moredifficult for PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility to access the capital markets. 
The trial and the Utili
ty’s conviction could harm the Utility’s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies andmake it more diffi
cult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management.  Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regula tory proceedings; 
for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges .   
In addition, the Utility’s 
conviction could result in increased regulatory or legislative pressure to require the separation of the Utility’s electric and natural gasbusinesses, restructure th
e corporate relationship between PG&E Corporation and the Utility, or undergo some other fundamental corporate restructuring.  As discussed underthe heading “Regulatory Mat
ters” in MD&A, the SED will evaluate PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s organizational struc ture in the CPUC’s pending investigation toexamine the Utility’s s
afety culture.

If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or pena lties or suffer negative consequ ences describedabove in the immediately prece

e of fut u re rat e making and regul a to ry proceeding s; for example, by enabling parties to  challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege aresomehow related to the 
Utility’s violations. 24

 The SED also could impose materi
al fines on the Utility based on the Utility’s self-reports submitted in accordance with the SED’s safety citation program and theUtility’s efforts to id
entify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way.   The Penalty Decision r equires the SED to review the Util ity’s gastransmission operations (
including t he Utility’s compliance with the remedies ordered by the Penalty Decision) and to perform annual audits of the Utility’s record-keepingpractices 
for a minimum of ten ye ars. T he SED could impose f ines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverable costs, or both, based on the outcome of the se future 
audits . In addition, although PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not currently face the possibility of fines or penalties in the first phase of the CPUC’s pendinginvestigation into the Uti
lity’s safety culture since it has been categorized as rate setting, it is uncertain how the next phase will be categorized.  (See the discussion under theheading “Regulatory Matte
rs” in MD&A.) 
The Utility could be subject 
to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to complian ce with federal, state or local laws,regulations or orders tha
t could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding r enewable energy and resource adequacy requirements;customer billing; customer 
service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices;and federal electric reliability standar
ds .  The SED could impose fines on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citationprograms.  
The amount of such fines, penal ties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.

The Utility’s ability to 
recover its natural gas transmission and storage costs and earn its authorized ROE could be materially affected by the amo unt of revenues theCPUC ultimately authorizes the Ut
ility to collect in the 2015 GT&S rate case proceeding and future GT&S rate cases.  (See “R egulatory Matters ” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The Utility 
continues to incur material unr ecoverable costs to meet the Penalty Decision’s requirement to fund safety-related projects and programs to be identified by the CPUC inthe 
2015 GT&S rate case.  Depending on how the CPUC designates pipe line safety-related projects and programs the Utility is required to fund, and how the Utility’sassociated costs are coun
ted toward meeting the $850 million maximum disallowance imposed by the Penalty Decision , the ultimate amount of unrecoverable pipeline-relatedcosts the Utility incurs m
ay be higher than current forecasts.  In addition, the Penalty Decision requires the Utility to implement various remedial measures which the CPUCestimated would cost $50 mil
lion.  Actual costs to implement the remedies could be high er. 
In addition, the Utility pl
ans to incur unrecoverable costs to continue performing certain work to complete projects under the PSEP and to identify and removeencroachments from gas 
transmission pipeline rights-of-way.  Actual costs to perform this work could exceed forecasts .  
PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results
primarily
depend
on
 the
outcomes
of

 regulatory
and
ratemaking

 and
the
Utility’s

 so
that
it
is

to
earn
its

rate
o f
return
in
a
timely
manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficientrevenues to recover the 
costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materiallyaffected if the CPUC or the FERC does not author
ize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE.   The outcome ofthe Utility’s ratem
aking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the Utility’s reputation (e specially if the Utility is convicted of the federal criminal chargesdiscussed above), 
the level of oppositio n by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislativeenvironments; and the opinions o
f the Utility’s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, andafford 
able electric and gas services.  
25

 The Utility 
also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehic
le charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs,energy storage and renewabl
e energy targets, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project.  The Utility’s ability to recover costs , including its investment s ,associated with 
these and other legislative and regul atory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether theassociated ratemaking mechanism
s can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service s .   
In addition to the amount of 
authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs tosafely and reliably se
rve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs.  The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing marketcircumstances, unanti
cipated events (such as storms, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be al
lowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when theUtility is authorized to 
collect revenues to recover such costs.  Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudentlyincurred by the Utility.

The Utility’s ability to 
recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and its impact on the Utility’s customers.  For example, a sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy could r
educe the Utility’s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase.  Although the Utilitygenerally recovers i
ts costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures increase when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base.  
Changes in commodity prices a
lso may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.   Although theUtility generally re
covers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices couldcreate overall rate pressures that
 make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs.   To relieve some of this upward ratepressure, the CPUC could authorize lower 
revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.  
PG&E

and
the
Utility’s

to

from

in

ti
mely
manner.

The
CPUC
may
disallow
procurement
costs
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
In
addition,
the
Utility’s
abilit y
torecover
these
costs
could
be
aff
ected
by
the
loss
of
Utility
customers
and

,
 if
the
CPUC

to

the
Utility’s
rates
to
reflect
suchevents.
 
The Utility meets customer
 demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricityprovided by third parties unde
r power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.   The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial andCPUC regulatory principles of “le
ast cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurementplan.  The CPUC could disallow procurement cos
ts incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did notcomply with its procuremen
t plan.  
Further, the contractua
l prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety ofreasons, including developmen
ts in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand dueto adverse economic condi
tions or the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers.   In particular, the Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy tomeet the higher targ
ets established by California SB 350 that became effective on January 1, 2016.  Despite the CPUC ’s current approval of the contrac ts, the CPUC coulddisallow contract costs 
in the future if it determines th at the costs are unreasonably above market.  
The Utility’s ability to
 recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by the whether the CAISO wholesale electric ity market continuesto function effectively.  
Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on whichthe market mechanis
ms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.   The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the highercosts of electrici
ty to customers.  For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California’s then-newly established wholesale electricitymarket led to dramatically high
 market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition forreorganization under Chapt
er 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
26

 Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Util
ity’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth that occursthrough municipalizat
ion of the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers whobecome direct access customers
 of alternative generation providers.  (See “Competition in the Electric ity Industry” in Item 1.)  As the number of bundled customers (i.e., thoseprimarily residential customers 
who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility wouldhave a smaller customer base
 from which to recover certain procurement costs.  Although the Utility is permi tted to collect non-bypassable charges for generation-related costsincurred on behalf of for
mer customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover the se costs.  In addition, the Utility’s ability to collect non-bypassablecharges has been, and may cont
inue to be, challenged by certain customer groups.  Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, theUtility could incur co
sts to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing l
evels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering (“NEM”), whichallows self-generating 
customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers.   In January 2016, the CPUCadopted new NEM rules and rates. 
  The new rules and rates are expected t o become effective for new NEM customers of the Utility later in 2016.   New NEM customers will berequired to pay an inter
connection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be required to pay some non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income,energy efficiency, and o
ther programs that other customers pay.   However, the resulting rules will still put upward rate pressure on remaining customers, and remove the cap on the number of NEM customers. 
  Significantly higher rates for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energyproviders. The CPUC states that it int
ends to revisit these rules in 2019. 
A confluence of technology-r
elated cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage aviable, cost-effective alternative to
 the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distributioninvestments.  If the numbe
r of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of capital investment would likely decline as well, inturn leading to a slower growth in 
rate base and earnings.  Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energyproviders, adoption of energy e
fficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatorycost allocations, could adv
ersely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. 
The CPUC has begun to implement rate r
eform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of providing service and decrease cost-subsidization among custome
r classes.  Many aspects of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a fixed charge oncertain customers.  I 
f the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact ofchanging loads, the wide deploymen
t of distributed generation, and the development of ne w electricity generation and energy storage technologies , PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial results c
ould be materially affected .

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will

cur costs to meet the Penalty Decision ’s requirement to incur costs of up to $850 million for safety-related projects and pr ograms to be identified bythe CPUC in the 
2015 GT&S rate case.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financingdepend primarily on 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and outlook.   Their credit ratings and outlook can be affected by man y factors, including the out come s of the 
on-going criminal prosecu tion, the pending CPUC investigations, and ratemaking proceed ings.  If PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s credit ratings were downgraded tobelow investment grade, the
ir ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options,including reduced 
, or lack of, access to the commercial paper mar ket, additional collateral posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increasedfinancing need.  Ot
her factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energycompanies generally or PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, an increase in interest rates by the Fed
eral Reserve Bank, and general economic and  financial market conditions. 
27

 The reputations of PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about matters discussed under “Enforcemen t and Litigation Matters”in Item 7. MD&A. 
  The negative publicity and the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matter s may undermine investors’ confidence in management’s ability to execute itsbusiness strategy and restor
e a constructive regulatory environment.  As a result, investors may be less willing to buy shares of PG&E Corporation common stock resulting in alower stock price.  Further, th
e market price of PG&E Corporation common stock could decline materially after the outcomes are determined.  The amount and timing of futureshare issuances also could a
ffect the stock price.  
If the Utility were unabl
e to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&E Corporation and PG&E Corporation could berequired to contribute 
capital to the Utility to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.  To maintain PG&E Corporation’s dividend level in these circumstances, PG&ECorporation would be further requ
ired to access the capital or credit markets.  PG&E Corporation may need to decrease or discontinue its common stock dividend if it is unableto access the capita
l or credit markets on reasonable terms.

PG&E Corporation is a holding company with no r
evenue generating operations of its own. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including itsobligation to serve custom
ers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before itcan distribute cash to PG&E Corpora
tion.  Under the CPUC’s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility’s dividend policy mus t be established by the Utility'sBoard of Directors as though the Uti
lity were a stand-alone utility company and PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors give “first priority” to the Utility’s capital requirements,as determined to be nec
essary and prudent to meet the Utility’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner.  The CPUC has interpreted this“first priority” obl
igation to include the requirement that PG&E Corporation “infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.” I 
n addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&E Corporation, the Utility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equitycomponent. 
 
If the Utility were requ
ired to pay a material amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs due to a conviction in the on-going criminal prosecution, the pendingCPUC investigations 
, or other enforcement matters , it would require equity cont ributions from PG&E Corporation to restore its capital structure.  PG&E Corporation common stock 
issuances used to fund such equity con tributions could materially dilute EPS . (See “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7. MD&A.)  Further, if PG&E Corporation were required to infuse th
e Utility with significant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&E Corporation, or both, PG&E Corporation may be unable to payprincipal and interes
t on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend , or meet other obligations.  
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that requireeach company to maintain a
 ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ca pitalization of at most 65%.

The Utility owns and operates ext
ensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric gener ating system . (See “ 
Electric Utility Operations ” and “ Natural Gas Utility Operations ” in Item 1. Business.)  The Utili ty’s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability toefficiently maintain, operate, an
d protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably.  The Utility undertakes substantial capital investmentprojects to construct, re
place, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at theend of their useful opera
ting lives.  The Utility’s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many ofwhich are beyond the Utility’s 
control, including those that arise from: 
·
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions,fires, or other catas
trophic events; 
28

 ·

an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to e quipment f ailure , i ncorrect o peratin g procedures or failure to follow correct operating procedures 
, or we lding or f abrication- r elated d efect s, that results in the fa ilure of downstream transmi ssion pipelines or distribut ion assets and uncontained natural gas flow;
 
·
f ailure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that result s in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gassurges back into homes, 
serious personal injury or loss of life;  
·
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that result s  in damage to the Utility ’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties;

·
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act ;  
·
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built; 
·
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably shouldhave identified, as unsaf
e, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or n atural gas explosion) , and the failure to respond effectively to a c
atastrophic event;·
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to r espo nd effectively to a c atastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or exte nded outages;
 
·
severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events,or other natural disasters;
 
·
operator or other human error; 
·
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, op erate and maintain a utility system safe ly and prudent ly;  
·
construc tion performed by third pa rties that damage the Utili ty’s underground or overhead facilities , including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-ins” thatdamage the Utility’s unde
rground pipelines ;  
·
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water , or soil, including, for examp le, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities ; flaking lead paint from the Utility's facilities, an
d leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment;  and ·
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks , acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war .  
The occurrence of any of th
ese events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output;damage the Utility’s ass
ets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and causepersonal injury or death.  As a r
esult, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties .  In particula 
r, the Utility may incur material liability in connection with a wildfire (known as the “Butte fire”) that ignited and spread in Amador and Calaver as c ounties i nNorthern California 
in September 2015 depending on the out come of the investigations into the cause of the fire . If insurance recoveries are unavailable or insufficient to coversuch 
costs , PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected.  The Utility also could incur material fines, penalties or disallowances 
, as a result of enforce ment actions taken by the CPUC or other law enforcemen t agencies .  
Further, although the Utility o
ften enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction ordemolition or facilities, the 
Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if thecontractor violates 
applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may also be subje ct to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury ordeath caused by third-par
ty contractor actions.  Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to providefull or even partial recovery
 under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effecton PG&E 
Corporation’s and the Utility ’s financial results.  Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility’s current insurancecoverage or may not be ava
ilable at all.

The operation of the 
Utility’s extensive electricity and natural gas systems rel ies on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information technology systems and network infrastructur
es that are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by thi rd parties.  The Utility’s business is highly dependent on its abilityto process and monitor, on a dai
ly basis, a very large number of tasks and transactions . Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Utility’s technology systems arevulnerable to disabili
ty or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.  The failure of the Utility’s operational and information technology systems and networks could significant
ly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; damage the Utility’s assets oroperations or those of third p
arties; and subject the Utility to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial results.
 
The Utility’s systems, includ
ing its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, andupdating, which can be costly and in
crease the risk of errors and malfunction.   The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to maintain, modify, and update its systems andthese third-party vendors 
could cease to exist.  Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation ofnew systems, could result in inc
reased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention and resources, and couldnegatively affect the Utility’s 
ability to maintain effective financial control s , and/or the Utility’s ability to timely file required regulatory reports.   The Utility also could besubject to patent infr
ingement claims arising from the use of third-party technology by the Utility or by a third-party vendor. 
In addition, the Utility’s 
information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees.  The theft, damage, or improperdisclosure of confidential
 information can subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject the Utility to claims from third parties, reduce the valueof proprietary inform
ation, and harm the Utility’s reputation.

The operation of the 
Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risksrelating to the storag
e, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, orterrorist act. 
  If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial results.   In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclearincident occurring not only 
at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.   (See Note 1 3 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.)     
In addition, the Utility con
tinues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel.   Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly filepetitions at the NRC and in other fo
rums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power .  Although an action in opposition may u
ltimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete.   It is also possible that public pressurecould grow 
leading to adverse changes in legislation, r egulations, orders, or their interpretation .  As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear g eneration units at Diablo Canyon 
could cease before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 .   In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of itsunrecovered investment 
and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial result s.  
30

 The Utility has incurred, and 
may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.   (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.Business.) 
  If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.   The Utility may determine thatit cannot comply with the new r
egulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to ceaseoperations until 
the Utility can comply with new regulations, o rders, or decisions.   T he Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before thelicenses expire 
in 2024 and 2025 .   At December 31, 2015, the Utility’s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $2.3 billion.

t the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significantmeasures to reduce the 
impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.   If the California Water Board requires the installation ofcooling towers that the Util
ity believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a materialcharge. 
  Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incur significant costs to comply with alternative compliances measures or to make payments tosupport various environmenta
l mitigation projects.   
Further, the Utility’s le
ases of coastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon expire in 2018 and2019.  The Utility has requested th
at the California State Lands Commission renew the leases until 2024 and 2025 when the NRC licenses expire.  The C alifornia State Lands Commission 
has deferred acting on th e application until later in 2016.  It is uncertain what level of environmental review, if any, will be required before the leases can beextended.  If 
the leases are not extended or if the Utility determines that it cannot comply with any new environmental condit ions in a feasible and econom ic manner , then operations at Diablo Canyon would ceas
e and the Utility could incur a material charge for the remaining amoun t of its unrecovered investment.   
The Utility also has an obliga
tion to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at theend of their useful lives. 
  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item8.) 
  The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected fromcustomers and held in nucle
ar decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.   If the Utility’s actual decommissioning costs, includingthe amounts held in the nucl
ear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.

operations
are

results.
 
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage,remediation of haza
rdous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife.  The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costsassociated with complian
ce with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations.  The Utility has been in the past , and may be in the future , required to pay for environmental remed
iation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws.  Although the Utility has recordedliabilities for known e
nvironmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, theapplicable remedi
ation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties.  (See Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 formore information.)  
 
Environmental remedi
ation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and moreexpansive application of 
existing environmental regulations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issuedby environmental or regul
atory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions.  
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to r
ecover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms.  One of these mechanismsallows the Utility rate 
recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemak
ing mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates. 
31

 Some of the Utility’s environ
mental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance 
.  (See “Environmental Regula tion” in Item 1.) The Utility’s costs to rem ediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abatethe effects of the con
tamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Their financial results also canbe materially affected by change
s in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.

The Utility has been studying the po
tential effects of climate change (increased temper atures, changing precipitation patterns , rising sea levels) on the Ut ility’soperations and is developing con
tingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project that climate change willincrease electricity demand due t
o more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  Increasing temperatu res and changing levels of precipita tion in the Utility’s service territory wouldreduce snowpack in the Sierra Moun
tains.  If the levels of snowpack were reduced, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation would decrease and the Utility would need to acquireadditional generation 
from other sources at a greater cost.   If the Utility increase s its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and tomeet increased custo
mer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits.  In addition, increasing temperatures and lower levels ofprecipitation could increase t
he occurrence of wildfires in the Utility’s service territory causing damage to the Utility’s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which theUtility relies to provid
e service , damage to third parti es for loss of property, personal injury, or loss of life . In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage theUtility’s facilities, includin
g hydroelectric assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission and distribution assets.  The Utility could incu r substantial costs to repairor replace facilities, restore service
, compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipat es that the increased costs would be recoveredthrough rates, but as rate p
ressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase.  
Events or conditions caused by cl
imate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lowerrevenues or increased exp
enses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected.

The Utility must comply with th
e terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operationof the Utility’s hydroele
ctric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility’s capi talinvestment projects, and so
me maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits.  These permits,authorizations, and lic
enses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays.  Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by theagencies that granted 
them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued.  In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of alicense or permit, such 
as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility.  If a license or permit is not renewed for a particularfacility and the Utility is
 required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs.  Before renewing a permit or license, the issuingagency may impose addition
al requirements that may increase the Utility’s compliance costs.  In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’shydroelectric gener
ation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reducedelectricity output and/or capacit
y at the facility.  In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or otherapprovals that the Utili
ty has not been previously required to obtain.   
The Utility may incur pena
lties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits,authorizations, licens
es, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&ECorporation’s and t
he Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility provid
e defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees.  The Utility alsomaintains three trus
ts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assetsand trust assets.  A decline in 
the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and othe r postretirement benefitsis also affected by othe
r factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discountrates used in determin
ing future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans.  Similarly, fundingrequirements for the nu
clear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning ordecommissioning funding requi
rements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials andequipment.  
(See Note 2: Summary of Signific ant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is requi red to makesignificant unplanned cont

The Utility owns or has obtained the 
right to occupy and/or use real property comprising the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, natural gasgathering facilities and generati
on facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1. Business, under “Electric Utility Operations”and “Natural Gas Utility Opera
tions.”  The Utility occupies or uses real property that it does not own primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, orlicenses from privat
e landowners or governmental authorities.  In total, the Utility occupies 11.1 million square feet of real property, including 8.9 million square feet owned bythe Utility.  The Utility's co

Transmission
On April 9, 2015, the CPUC approved final decisions in th
e three investigations that had been brought against the Utility relating to (1) the Utility’s safety record-keeping for its natural g
as transmission system, (2) the Utility’s operation of its natural gas transmission pipeline system in or near locations of higher population density, and (3)the Utility’s pipeline 
installation, integrity management, record-keeping and other operational practices, and other events or courses of conduct, that could have led to orcontributed to the 
natural gas explosion that o ccurred in the City of San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010 .  A decision was issued in each invest igative proceeding todetermine the viola
tions that the Utility committed.  The CPUC also approved a fourth decision (the “Penalty Decision”) which imposes penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6billion comprised of: (1
) a $300 million fine to be paid to the State General Fund, (2) a one-time $400 million bill credit to the Utility’s natural gas customers, (3) $850 million tofund future pipeline saf
ety projects and programs, and (4) remedial measures that the CPUC estimates will cost the Utility at least $50 million.  In August 2015, the Utility paidthe $300 million fine. 
At December 31, 2015, the Consolidated Bal ance Sheets include $400 million in current liabilities – other for the one-time bill credit that  will be providedto the Utility’s 
natural gas customers in 2016.  On Janu ary 14, 2016, the CPUC issued final decisions to close these investigative proceedings. 
The Penalty Decision requires 
that at least $689 million of the $850 million disallowance be allocated to capital expenditures, and that the Utility be precluded fromincluding these capita
l costs in rate base.  The CPUC will determine which safety projects and programs will be funded by shareholders in the Utility’s pending 2015 GT&S ratecase.  If the $850 million 
is not exhausted by designated safety-related projects and programs in the 2015 GT&S proceeding, the CPUC will identify additional projects in futureproceedings to ensure that 
the full $850 million is spent. The CPUC is expected to issue a final decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case in 2016 to identify safety-relatedprojects and programs tha
t will be subject to the disallowance. It is uncertain how much of the Utility’s costs to perform the safety-related projects and programs the CPUC willidentify as counting toward th
e $850 million shareholder-funded obligation. If the Utility’s actual costs exceed costs that the CPUC counts towards the $850 million maximum,the Utility would record addi
tional charges if such costs are not otherwise authorized by the CPUC.  As a result, the total shareholder-funded obligation could exceed $850million.

 Federal
Criminal
Indictment
 
On July 29, 2014, a federal grand jury fo
r the Northern District of California returned a 28-count superseding criminal indictment against the Utility in federal districtcourt that superseded the o
riginal indictment that was returned on April 1, 2014.  The superseding indictment charges 27 felony counts alleging that the Utility knowingly andwillfully violated min
imum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integrity management, and identification of pipelinethreats.  The superseding indi
ctment also includes one felony count charging that the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB’s investigation into the cause of the San Brunoaccident.  On December 23, 2015, the 
court presiding over the federal criminal proceeding dismissed 15 of the Pipeline Safety Act counts, leaving 13   remaining counts.  Themaximum statutory fin
e for each felony count is $500,000 for total potential fines of $6.5 million.  On December 8, 2015, the court also issued an order granting, in part, theUtility’s request to dism
iss the government’s allegations seeking an alternative fine under the Alternative Fines Act.  ( The Alternative Fines Act sta tes, in part: “If any personderives pecuniary gain f
rom the offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not more than the greater oftwice the gross gain or twice 
the gross loss.” )  The court dismissed the gove rnment’s allegations regarding the amount of losses, but concluded that it required additionalinformation about how the govern
ment would prove its allegations about the amount of the gross gain prior to deciding whether to d ismiss those allegations . ( Based on thesuperseding indictment’s 
allegation that the Utility derived gross gains of approximately $281 million, the potential maximum alternative fine would be approximately $562million. 
)   After considering the additional information submitted by the government, on February 2, 2016, the court issued an order holding that if the governm ent’s allegationsabout the Utility’s gross gains 
are considered, they would be considered in a second trial phase that would take place after the trial on the  criminal charges. The trial on thecriminal charges cu
rrently is scheduled to begin March 22, 2016. 
The Utility entered a pl
ea of not guilty.     The Utility believes that criminal charges and the alternative fine allegations are not merited and that it did not knowingly andwillfully violate min
imum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act or obstruct the NTSB’s investigation, as alleged in the superseding indictment.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e not accrued any charges for criminal fines in their Consolidated Financial Statements as such amounts are not considered to be probable.

As of December 31, 2015, there were six pu

35

 Four of the complaints were conso

e demurrers filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility and the individual director and officer defendants seeking to dismiss the San Bruno
Fire
Derivative

, based upon the plaintiffs’ failure to demand action by the Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prior to filing the complaint.  After theruling, and pursuant to co-pet
itions for writ of mandate previously filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the individual defendants, on September 3, 2015, the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal issued an order stay

Investigation
of
the
Butte
Fire
 
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.  The California Department ofForestry and Fire Protection (
“Cal Fire”) is investigating the source of the Butte Fire to determine whether a tree contacted a power line operated by the Utility and was the causeof the fire.  Cal Fire has r
eported that as a result of the fire there were two deaths and 965 structures, including 571 houses, were damaged or destroyed. Cal Fire’s investigation isexpected to conclude in 2016. 
   
Approximately 27 complaints h
ave been filed against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in both the County ofCalaveras and the County of San Francis
co, involving more than 600 individual plaintiffs and their insurance companies. Plaintiffs and the Utility filed petitions with theCalifornia Judicial Counci
l to coordinate these cases.  The petitions were assigned to the Calaveras Superior Court for a recommendation to the Judicial Council.  On January 21,2016, the Calaveras Superior Court issu
ed an order recommending to the Judicial Council that the cases be coordinated in the Superior Court of California, Sacramento County,for all purposes including t
rial.  Among other factors, the Court found that coordination requires a court with a significant number of judges and complex litigation supportpersonnel, neither of which a
re present in Calaveras County.  For additional information, see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13: Contingencies and Commitmentsof the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.
Other
Enforcement
Matters
 
The Utility also could be requ
ired to pay fines, or incur other unrecoverable costs, associated with the CPUC’s pending investigations of the Utility’s natural gasdistribution facili
ties record-keeping practices and the Utility’s potential violations of the CPUC’s ex parte communication rules.  In addition, fines may be i mposed, or otherregulatory or government
al enforcement action could be taken, with respect to the Utility’s self-reports of noncompliance with natural gas safety regulations, investigations thatwere commenced afte
r a pipeline explosion in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014, and other enforcement matters. See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13: Contingencies and Commitments o
f the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Diablo
Canyon
Power
Plant
 
The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant e
mploys a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the Central CoastBoard. This permit allows the Diab
lo Canyon power plant to discharge the cooling water at a temperature no more than 22 degrees above the temperature of the ambientreceiving water, and requ
ires that the beneficial uses of the water be protected.     The beneficial uses of water in this region include industrial water supply, marine and wildlifehabitat, shellfish harv
esting, and preservation of rare and endangered species.     In January   2000, the Central Coast Board issued a proposed draft cease and desist orderalleging that, although th
e temperature limit has never been exceeded, the Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant's discharge was not protective of beneficial uses. 
36

 In October 
  2000, the Utility and the Central Coast Board reached a tentative settlement under which the Central Coast Board agreed to find that the Utility's dischargeof cooling water from the Di
ablo Canyon power plant protects beneficial uses and that the intake technology reflects the best technology available, as defined in the federal CleanWater Act. 
    As part of the tentative settlement, the Utility agreed to take measures to preserve certain acreage north of the plant and to fund approximately $6   million inenvironmental projec
ts and future environmental monitoring related to coastal resources.     On March   21, 2003, the Central Coast Board voted to accept the settlementagreement. 
    On June   17, 2003, the settlement agreement was executed by the Utility, the Central Coast Board and the California Attorney General's Office.     A condition tothe effectiveness of 
the settlement agreement is that the Central Coast Board renew Diablo Canyon's permit. 
At its July 
  10, 2003 meeting, the Central Coast Board did not renew the permit and continued the permit renewal hearing indefinitely.     Several Central Coast Boardmembers indicated th
at they no longer supported the settlement agreement, and the Central Coast Board requested a team of independent scientists, as part of a technical workinggroup, to develop additional in
formation on possible mitigation measures for Central Coast Board staff.     In January   2005, the Central Coast Board published the scientists'draft report recom
mending several such mitigation measures.     If the Central Coast Board adopts the scientists' recommendations, and if the Utility ultimately is required toimplement the proje
cts proposed in the draft report, it could incur costs of up to approximately $30   million.     The Utility would seek to recover these costs through ratescharged to customers.
 
The final requiremen
ts of the federal and state cooling water policies (discussed above in Item 1. Business under “Environmental Regulation – Water Quality”) couldaffect future negot
iations between the Central Coast Board and the Utility regarding the status of the 2003 settlement agreement.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe thatthe ultimate outcome of this
 matter will not have a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition or results of operations.   
Venting
Incidents
in
San
Benito
County
 
As part of its regular ma
intenance and inspection practices for its natural gas transmission system, the Utility performs in-line inspections of pipelines using devicescalled “pigs” that t
ravel through the pipeline to inspect and clean the walls of the pipe.  When in-line inspections are performed, natural gas in the pipeline is released or vented atthe pipeline station wher
e the device is removed.  In February 2014, the Utility conducted an in-line inspection of a natural gas transmission pipeline that traverses San BenitoCounty and vented the natural gas 
at the Utility’s transmission station located in Hollister, which is next to an elementary school.  The Utility vented the natural gas duringschool hours on three occasions th
at month.  After being informed of the venting by the local air district, the San Benito County District Attorney notified the Utility inDecember 2014 that it was cont
emplating bringing legal action against the Utility for violation of Health and Safety Code section 41700, which prohibits discharges of aircontaminants that caus
e a public nuisance.  The Utility has been in settlement discussions with the district attorney’s office since that time.  On October 28,   2015, the districtattorney informed the Ut
ility that it would seek civil penalties in excess of $100,000 but is willing to continue to explore settlement options with the Utility.

MANAGEMENT’S

AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS 
OVERVIEW
 
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility operating in northern and centralCalifornia.  The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. 
The Utility’s 
base revenue requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case and by the FERC in its TO rate c ases based on forecast costs.    Differences between for
ecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of marke t forces on the cost of laborand materials. 
    Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.     Generally, differences between actual costs andforecast costs could af
fect the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations below).    
However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated with pension and other employee benefits, the Utility is authorized to track the difference between actual amountsand forecast amounts and r
ecover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operationsbelow). 
    The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers , such as the costs to procure electricity or natural gas for it
s customers .     Therefore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generally do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Coststhat did not Impact Earn
ings” in Results of Operations below).     See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” in Item 1 for further discussion. 
This is a combined report of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities.  This combinedMD&A should be read in conjunction with th
e Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. 43

 Summary
of
Changes
in
Net
Income
and
Earnings
per
Share  
T 
he following table is a summary reconciliation of the key changes, after-tax, in PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders and EPS (as well as earnings from operations 
and EPS based on earnings from operations) for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (see “Results of Operations” below). 
  “ Earnings from operations ” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income available for common shareholders less items impactingcomparability. 
  “ Items impacting comparability ” represent items that managem ent does not consider part of the normal course of operations and affect comparability of financial results be
tween periods.   PG&E Corporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposesincluding internal budget
ing and forecasting, short- and long-term operating plans, and employee incentive co mpensation .   PG&E Corporation believes that earnings fromoperations provide addition
al insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance.  E 
arnings from operations are not a substitute or a lternative for GAAP measures such as income av ailable for common sha reholders and may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures used by oth
er companies.

In 2014, natural gas matters included pipeline-related costs to perform work under the PSEP and other activities associated with safety improvements to the Utility’s natural gas system, as well as legaland other costs related to natural gas matters. Natural gas matter 
s also included charges related to fines, third party liability claims, and insurance recoveries in 2014.( 
2 )   In 2014, the Utility reduced its accrual related to the Hinkley whole house water replacement program.   (3)  
“Earnings from operations” is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and excludes the items impacting comparability shown in n otes (1) and (2) above and Notes ( 7 ), ( 8 ), and ( 9 ) below.( 
4 ) Represents expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, with no corresponding increase in revenue.  The Utility has requested that the CPUC authorize an increase to the Utility’s 
revenue requirements for 2015, 2016, and 2017 in its 2015 GT&S rate case , and exp ects a final decision in 2016 .  A ny revenue requirement increase that the CPUC may authorize would be retroactive to January 1, 2015 
but would be recorded in the period a final decision is issued . ( 
5 ) Includes legal and other regulatory related costs that were partially offset by incentive revenues . ( 
6 ) Represents the larger gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2015. (7 
) Represents insurance recoveries of $49 million, pre-tax, for third party claims and associated legal costs related to the San Bruno accident the Utility received during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Utility has received a cumulative total of $515 mi
llion through insurance related to $558 million of third-party claims and $92 million of legal costs incurred. No further insurance recoveries related tothes 
e claims and costs are expected . (8 
) Represents the impact of the Penalty Decision (see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for before-tax amounts) . ( 
9 ) In 2015, pipeline-related expenses include costs incurred to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way and to performremaining work under the Utility’s PSEP.  Legal andregulatory related expenses include costs incurred in connection with various enforcement, regulatory, and litigat
ion activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications.44

 Key
Factors
Affecting
Results
of
Operations,
Financial
Condition,
and
Cash
Flows  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that their future results of operations, fin ancial condition, and cash flows will be materiall y affected by the following factors: 
 
·
The
Outcome
of
Enforcement
and
Litigation
Matters.
  Future financial results will be impacted by the unrecoverable pipeline safety-re
lated and remedies costs required by the Penalty Decision. The Utility’s future resu lts may also beimpacted by various other p
ending enforcement and regulatory actions, including the federal criminal charg es and CPUC investigations of the Util
ity’s compliance with natural gas distribution record-keeping practices and potential violations ofthe CPUC’s ex parte communication 
rules.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the N otes to the Consolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 .)  

 ·
T
he
Timing
and
Outcome
of
Regulatory
Matters
 .  The 2015 GT&S rate case remains pending.  T he Utility requested that the CPUC authorize 
a $532 million increase in annual revenue requirements for gas transmission and storage operationsbeginning on January 1, 2015 with attri
tion increases in 2016 and 2017.  Any revenue requirement in crease that the CPUC may authorize 
would be retroactive to Janu ary 1, 2015 but would be recorded in the per iod a final decision is reached . (See“ 
Regulatory Matters − 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” below for more information.)   In September 2015,the Utility filed its 2017 GRC appli
cation to request that the CPUC authorize revenue requirements for the Utility’s electricgeneration business and its e
lectric and natural gas distribution business for 2017 through 2019.  (See “ Regulatory Matters − 
2017 General Rate Case” below for more information.)  In addition, the Utility has one transmission owner rate casepending at the FERC (See “ 
Regulatory Matters – FERC TO Rate Cases” below . )   The outcome of regulatory proceedingscan be affected by many 
factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties, potential rate impacts, the Utility’sreputation, the regula
tory and political environments, and other facto rs . 
 ·
The
Ability
of
the
Utility
to
Control
Operating
Costs
and
Capital
Expenditures.
  Whether the Utility is able to earn itsauthorized rate of return 
could be materially affected if the  Utility’s actual costs differ from the amounts authorized in therate case decisions. 
  In addition to incurring shareholder-funded costs and costs associated with remedial measures requiredby the Penalty Decision, 
t he Utility also forecasts that in 201 6 it will incur unrecovered pipeline-related expenses rangingfrom 
$ 100 million to $150 million which primarily rela te to costs to identify and remove encroachments from transmissionpipeline rights-of-way 
. The ultimate amount of unrecovered costs also could be affected by how the CPUC determineswhich costs are included in de
termining whether the $850 million shareholder-funded obligation under the Penalty Decisionhas been met, and the outcom
e of pending and future investigations and enforcement matters.  (See  “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” 
in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidat ed Financial Statements in Item 8 .) The Utility’s ability torecover costs in the futu
re also could be affected by decreases in customer demand driven by legislative and regulatoryinitiatives relating to distrib
uted generation resources, renewable energy requirements, and changes in the electric ratestructure. 
  
 ·
The
Amount
and
Timing
of
the
Utility’s
Financing
Needs.

PG&E Corporation contributes equity to the Utility as needed tomaintain the Utility
’s CPUC-au thorized capital st ructure.  In 201 5 , PG&E Corporation issued $ 801 million of commonstock 
with cash proceeds and made equity contribut ions to the Utility of $ 705 million.  PG&E Corporation forecasts that itwill issu 
e a material amount of equity in 2016 and future years to support the Utility’s cap ital expenditures .  PG&E Corporation will issue addition
al equity to fund charges incurred by the Uti lity to comply with the Penalty Decision, to fundunrecoverable pipelin
e-related expenses, and to pay fines and penalti es that may be required by the final outcomes ofpending enforcement matters. 
  These additional issuances would have a material dilutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS. 
  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets and the terms and rates of future financingscould be affected by the ou
tcome of the matters discussed in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notesto the Consolidated Financial St
atements in Item 8 , Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , changes in theirrespective credit 
ratings, general economic and market conditions, and other factors. 
 For more information about 
the factors and risks that could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows,or that could cause fut
ure results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors .  In addition, this 201 5 Form 10-K contains forward-looking sta tements that arenecessarily subject to v
arious risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based on current estimates, expectations, andprojections about future 
events and assumptions regarding these events and management's knowledge of facts as of the date of this report.  See the section entitled “CautionaryLanguage Regarding Forward 
- Looking Statements” below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and the Utilityare not able to predic

The consolidated results of op

PG&E Corporation’s net income or loss 
consists primarily of interest expense on long-term debt, other income or loss from investments, and inco me taxes.  Resultsinclude approximately $30 
million and $45 million of realized gains and associated tax benefits related to an investment in SolarCity Corporation recognized in 2015 and 2014,respectively. 
  PG&E Corporation’s operating results i n 2013 reflected an impairment loss of $29 m illion related to tax equity fund investments .  
Utility
 
The table below shows certain i
tems from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .  The table separately i dentifies the revenues andcosts that impacted e
arnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (such as costs to purchase electric
ity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover those pass-through costs,do not impact earnings.  In add
ition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as the payment of pension costs) and the corresponding revenues the Utility isauthorized to collec
t to recover such costs, do not impact earnings. 
Revenues 
that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assets andto provide the Utility an oppor
tunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that i mpact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incurs to own and operateits assets.

Utility
Revenues
and
Costs
that
Impacted
Earnings

The following discussion presents th
e Utility’s operating results for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , focusing on revenues and expenses th at impacted earnings for theseperiods.
 
Operating
Revenues
 
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues increased $ 393 million or 4% in 2015 compared to 2014 , primarily a result of approximately $490 million of additional base revenues 
as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and by the FERC in the TO rate case.   This increase was partially offset by the absence ofapproximately 
$110 million of revenues the CPUC authori zed the Utility to collect for recovery of certain PSEP-related costs during the same period in 2014. 
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $ 890 million or 11% in 2014 compared to 2013 .  This amount include d anincrease to base revenu
es of $460 million as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision.   T he GRC decision also resulted in higher base r evenues of $150 million in2014 related primari
ly to the DOE settlement for sp ent nuclear fuel stor age costs.   The total incr ease in operating revenu es include d approximately $150 millio n of PSEP-related 
revenues, and revenues authorized by th e FERC in the TO rate case , as well as revenues authorized by the CPUC for re covery of nuclear decommissioning costs.  TheUtility also collect
ed higher gas transmission revenues driven by increased demand for gas-fired generation. 
47

 Operating
and
Maintenance

The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings in creased $ 1.2 b illion or 27% in 2015 compared to 2014 , primarily due to $ 907 million incharges associated with th
e Penalty Decision , consisting of $400 million for the customer bill credit, an additional $100 million charge for the f ine payable to the state , and $407 million of disallowed cap
ital charges. ( See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 . )   Theincrease is also due to high
er labor and ben efit-related expenses of approximately $100 mil lion and fewer insurance recoveries for third-party claims and associated legal costs of $63 million 
related to the San Bruno acc ident .  No further insurance recov eries related to these claims are expected.   These increases were offs et by $116 million indisallowed capital re
corded in 2014 related to the PSEP.  
The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $127 millio n or 3% in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to lower third-party claims and associated 
legal costs of $117 million resulting from the settlement of all outstanding third-party claims, lower disallowed capital expenditures of $80 million andlower insurance recover
ies for third-party claims and associated legal costs of $42 million related to the San Bruno accident . These decreases were offs et by higher benefit-related expenses and othe
r operating expenses of $120 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 .  
Depreciation,
Amortization,
and
Decommissioning
 
The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased $ 179 million or 7% in 2015 compared to 2014 and $ 355 million or 17% in 2014compared to 
2013 .  In 2015, the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the FERC in the TO rate case .  In 2014, the increase was prima
rily due to higher depreciation rates as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and higher nuclear decommissioning expense reflectingthe year-to-date in
crease as authorized by the CPUC in the nuclear decommissioning triennial proceeding.     Additionally, depreciation, amortization, and decommissioningexpenses were impacted by an 
increase in capital additions during 2014 as compared to 2013 .  
Interest
Expense
 
The Utility’s 
interest expenses increased by $ 43 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the issuance ofadditional long-term d
ebt.  There were no materia l changes to interest expense in the year ended Dec ember 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.

Income
Tax
Provision

The Utility’s revenue requ
irements for the 2014 GRC decision period reflects flow-through ratemaking for income tax expense benefits attributable to the acceleratedrecognition of repair 
costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s effective tax rates for 2015 are lower ascompared to 2014 and for 2014 as comp
ared to 2013 and are expected to rem ain lower than the statutory rate in 2016 due to these temporary differences. 
The Utility’s income tax p
rovision dec reased $ 403 million or 105% in 2015 as compared to 2014 .  This is primarily the r esult of the statutory tax effect, $397 million,of the 
lower i ncome b efore i ncome t axes in 2015 as compared to 2014 .   T he lower effective tax rate is the result of the tax benefits from property-related timing differencesapplied to this lower incom
e before income taxes. 
T 
he Utility’s income tax provision inc reased $ 58 million or 18% in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher i ncome b efore i ncome t axes , partially offset by certain reductions in 
tax expense for flow-through treatment as discussed above.

Cost
of
Electricity

The 
Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its owngeneration facili
ties, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses onprice risk management activities.

) C ost of purchased power was impacted primarily by a decline in the market price of natural gas in 2015 compared to 2014. ( 
2) T he decrease in purchased power resulted from an increase in generation from the Utility’s own generation facilities.  Gas-fired and nuclear generation increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same periods in 2014.

The Utility’s total purch
ased power is driven by customer demand, the availability of the Utility’s own generation facilities (including the Diablo Canyon nucleargeneration power plant
 and hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source of electricity .

 Cost
of
Natural
Gas 
The Utility’s cost of natur
al gas includes the costs of procurement, storage, transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, andrealized gains and losses on p
rice risk management activities.   (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s cost of natur al gas isimpacted by the marke

Expenses
 
The Utility’s operating exp
enses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred such as pension contributions andpublic purpose programs costs.  I
f the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.  For 2015, 2014 , and 2013, nomaterial amounts wer

LIQUIDITY
AND
FINANCIAL
RES
OURCES
Overview
 
The Utility’s ability to 
fund operations, finance capital expenditures, and make distributions to PG&E Corporation depends on the levels of its operating cash flows andaccess to the capita
l and credit markets. The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure, the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue,and the revenue require
ments the Utility is able to collect related to its financing costs. The Utility generally utilizes equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-termsenior unsecured debt issuanc
es to maintain its CPUC-authorized long-term capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock.  (See “RatemakingMechanisms” in Item 1) 
.  The Utility relies on short -term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.  
PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund ope
rations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility , and pay dividends , primarilydepends on the level of cash dis
tributions received from the Utility and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets. PG&E Corporation has material stand-alonecash flows related to 
the issuance of equity and long -term debt, dividend payments, and borrowings and repayments under its revolving credit f acility.  PG&E Corporation relieson short-term debt, includ
ing commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs. 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending enforcement and litigation matters.  Credit rating downgrades may increase the 
cost and availability of short-term borrowin g, including commercial paper , the costs associated with credit facilities, and l ong-term debt costs.  In addition, some 
of the Utility’s commodity contracts contain collatera l posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. If the Utility’s credit ra
ting were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability positions 
.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolida ted Financial Statements in Item 8.)  
PG&E Corporation’s equity contribut
ions to the Utility are funded primarily through common stock issuances.  PG&E Corporatio n forecasts that it wil l issue between$6 
00 million and $800 million in common stock during 2016 , primarily to fund equity contributions to the Utility.  T he Utility’s future equity needs will continue to be affected by 
charges incurred to comply with the Penalty Decision, by unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses, and by fines and penalties that may be imposed in connection with the matters described in “Enforceme
nt and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidat ed Financial Statements in Item 8 below . Common stock issuances byPG&E Corporation to fund these needs would 
have a material di lutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS .

 Cash
and
Cash
Equivalents
 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ma
intain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.  In addition to cash and cash equivalents, theUtility holds restrict
ed cash that primarily consists of cash held in escrow pending the resolution of the remaining disputed claims that were filed in the Utility’s reorganizationproceeding under Chapter 11 of th
e U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  (See “Resolution of Remaining Chapter 11 Disputed Claims” in Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan cialStatements in Item 8.)  Th
e Utility is uncertain when and how the remaining disputed claims will be resolved. 
Financial
Resources

Debt
and
Equity
Financings
 
The Utility issued $1.15 billion in 
long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2015.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.)   
 
In February 2015, PG&E Corporation entered 
into a new equity distribution agreement providing for the sale of PG&E Corporation common stock having an aggregategross sales price of up to $500 mi
llion.  During 2015, PG&E Corporation sold   1.4 million shares of common stock under this agr eement for cash proceeds of $ 74 million, netof commissions paid of $1 mil
lion. 
In August 2015, PG&E Corporation sold 6.8 million shar
es of its common stock in an underwritten public offering for cash proceeds of $352 million, net of fees. 
In addition, 
d uring 2015, PG&E Corporation sold 7.9 million shares of com mon stock under its 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestm ent and Stock Purchase Plan, andshare-based compensation p
lans for total cash proceeds of $ 354 million .  
The proceeds from 
equity issuances were used for general corpo rate purposes, including the contribution of equity into the Utility .  For the year ended December 31,2015 
, PG&E Corporation made equity contr ibutions to the Utility of $ 705 million, of which $300 million was us ed to pay a fine to the State General Fund as required by thePenalty Decision.  Additionally, PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility expect to continue to issue long-term and short-term debt for general corporate purposes and to maintain theCPUC-authorized capital struc
ture during 2016.
Revolving
Credit
Facilities
and
Commer
cial
Paper
Programs 
At December 31, 2015, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had $ 300 million and $ 1.9 billion available under their respective $ 300 million and $3.0 billion revolvingcredit facilit
ies.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)   
T 
he revolving credit facilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at most65% as of the end of each fis
cal quarter.  At December 31, 2015, PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut ility’s total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization was 51% and50 
% , respectively.  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit fac ility agreement also requires that PG&E Corporation own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding common stock and at least 70
% of the outstanding voting capital stock of th e Utility.   In addition, the revolving c redit facilities include usual and customary provisions regarding events of default and coven
ants including covenants limiting liens to those p ermitted under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s senior note indentures, mergers, and imposing conditions on the 
sale of all or substanti ally all of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s assets and o ther fundamental changes.   At December 31, 2015 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility were in compl 
iance with all covenants und er their respective revolving credit facilities.

For each of the quarters in 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , t he Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared common stock dividends o f $ 0.455 p er share, for annualdividends of 
$ 1.82 per share.   Dividends paid to common stockholde rs by PG&E Corporation were $ 856 million in 2015 , $ 828 million in 2014 , and $ 782 million in 2013 . In December 2015, the Board of Dire
ctors of PG&E Corporation declared quarterly dividends of $ 0.455 per share, totali ng $ 224 milli on, of which approximately $ 219 million was paid on January 15, 
2016 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2015.

 Utility
 
For each of the quarters in 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the Utility’s Board of Directors declared common stock dividends in the aggregate amount of $ 179 million toPG&E 
Corporation for annual dividends p aid of $ 716 million in each of 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .  In addition, the Utility pa id $ 14 million of dividends on preferred stock ineach of 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .  The Utility’s preferr ed stock is cumulative and any dividends in arrears must be paid before the Utility may pay any common stock dividends. In December 2015, the Board of Dire
ctors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock, payable o n February 15, 2016, to shar eholders of record on January 29

Operating
Activities
 
The Utility’s cash flows from op
erating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such asdepreciation that do not 
require the use of cash.  During 2015 , net cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 101 million compared to 2014 .  This increase wasprimarily due to higher b
ase revenue collections authorized in the 2014 GRC and lower purchased power costs (see “Cost of Electricity” under “Results of Operations – UtilityRevenues and Costs that did not Impac
t Earnings” above), offset by the payment of a $300 million fine to the State General Fund as required by the Penalty Decision.   During 2014 
, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $203 million compared to 2013 .  This increase was primar ily due to tax refunds received during 2014 compared totax payments made during 2013 and 
additional collateral returned to the Utility in 2014 as compared to 2013, offset by higher purchased power costs (see “Cost of Electricity” under “Results of Operations – Util
ity Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” above) .  
52

 Future cash flow from operat
ing activities will be affected by various factors, including: 
•
the shareholder-funded bill credit of $400 million to natural gas customers in 2016, as required by the Penalty Decision (see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements); 
 •
the timing and amounts of other fines or penalties that may be imposed in connection with the criminal prosecution of the Utility and the remaining investigations andother enforcement matters (see “E
nforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidat ed Financial Statements in Item 8 below);  
 •
the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, including the 2015 GT&S rate case;
 •
the timing and amount of costs the Utility incurs, but does not recover, associated with its natural gas system (including costs to implement remedial measures and $850million to pay for designa
ted pipeline safety projects and programs, as required by the Penalty Decision);
 •
the timing and amount of tax payments (including the bonus depreci ation extension) , tax refunds, net collat eral paym ents, and interest paymen ts;
 •
the timing of the resolution of the Chapter 11 disputed claims and the amount of principal and interest on these claims that the Utility will be required to pay. 
Investing
Activities
 
Net cash used in investing act
ivities increased by $ 412 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to an inc rease of $340 million in capital expendituresand an increase in net pur
chases of nuclear decommissioning trust investments in 2015 as compared to net proceeds associated with sales of nuclear decommissioning trustinvestments in 2014 
.   Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $343 million during 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due a decrease of $374 million in capitalexpenditures.  This decreas
e was primarily due to lower PSEP-related capital expenditures and the absence of additional investment in the Utility’s photovoltaic program.   
Future cash flows used in investing a
ctivities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur between$5. 
4 billion and $5. 6 billion i n 2016 .  
Financing
Activities
 
During 
2015 , net cash provided by financing activities increased by $ 325 million as compared to 2014 .  During 2014 , net cash provided by financing activitiesdecreased by $427 million as 
compared to 2013 .  Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cashprovided by or used in operating a
ctivities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existingdebt instruments.  The Utili
ty generally utilizes long-term debt issuances and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure,and relies on short-ter
m debt to fund temporary financing needs.53

lumn entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension and other benefit plans.( 
4) Based on historical performance, it is assumed for purposes of the table above that dividends are payable within a fixed period of five years. 
The contractual commitments table
 above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions .  Due to the uncertainty surround ing tax audits,PG&E Corporation and the Utility canno
t make reliable estimates of the amount s and period s of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognized tax benefits. Matters relating to 
tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .

 Department
of
Interior
Inquiry
 
In September 2015, the Utility was no
tified that the U.S.   Department of Interior (“DOI”) had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended ordebarred from entering into 
  federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs citing the allegations contained in the superseding criminal indictment (See Note 13 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8) .   The Utility filed its initial response on Novemb er 2, 2015 , to demonstrate that it is a presently responsible contractorunder federal procure
ment regulations and that it believes suspension or debarment is not appropriate.   It is uncertain when or if further action will be taken. 
Pending
Lawsuits
and
Claims
 
As of December 31, 2015, there were six pu
rported derivative lawsuits seeking recovery on behalf of PG&E Corporation and the Utility for alleged breaches offiduciary duty by office
rs and directors, among other claims. 
Four of the complaints were conso

e demurrers filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility and the individual director and officer defendants seeking to dismiss the San Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
, based upon the plaintiffs’ failure to demand action by the Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prior to filing the complaint.  After theruling, and pursuant to co-pet
itions for writ of mandate previously filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the individual defendants, on September 3, 2015 the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal issued an order stay

 2017
General
Rate
Case
 
On September 1, 2015, the Utility fi
led its 2017 GRC application with the CPUC. In the 2017 GRC, the Utility has requested that the CPUC determine the annualamount of base revenues (or 
“revenue requirements”) that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs forelectric distribu
tion, natural gas distribution, and electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return. (The Utility’srevenue requirements 
for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission, natural gas transmission and storage services, and electricity and natural gas purchases,are authorized in othe
r regulatory proceedings ove rseen by the CPUC or the FERC.)  In its application, the Ut ility requested a revenue requirement increase of $457 million, ascompared to authorized b
ase revenues for 2016, as shown in the following tables:

In its application, the Ut
ility stated that over the 2017-2019 GRC period the Utility plans to make average annual capital investments of approximately $4 billion inelectric distribution, natural 
gas distribution and electric generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service. (These annual investments would beincremental to the Utility’s ca
pital expenditures for electric and natural gas transmission infrastructure.)   The Utility also requested that the CPUC establish a ratemakingmechanism that would incr
ease the Utility’s authorized revenues in 2018 and 2019, primarily to reflect increases in rate base due to capital investments in infrastructure and, to alesser extent, antic
ipated increases in wages and other expenses. The Utility estimates that this mechanism would result in increases in revenue of $489 million in 2018 and anadditional $390 million in 2019.
 
56

 In October 2015, the Utility fi
led supplemental testimony to reduce its original revenue requirement request by approximately $17 million per year based on its forecastthat it will incur approx
imately $61 million for unrecoverable costs to implement the remedies ordered in the Penalty Decision. 
On February 22, 2016 the Utility will fi
le an update of its forecasted increase, primarily to reflect the impact of the recent five-year extension of the federal tax codeprovisions regarding bonus deprec
iation. 
According to the CPUC’s current procedur
al schedule, testimony from the ORA and other parties is due in April 2016, evidentiary hearings are to be held this summer,followed by a proposed decision to be 
released in November 2016 and a final CPUC decision to be issued in December 2016.  The Utility has requested that the CPUC issue anorder directing that 
the authorized revenue requirement changes be effective January 1, 2017, even if the final decision is issued after that date. 
2015
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case
 
In the 2015 GT&S rate case, the Uti
lity requested that the CPUC authorize a 2015 revenue requirement of $1.263 billion to recover anticipated costs of providingnatural gas transmission 
and storage services, an increase of $532 million over currently authorized amounts.   The Utility also requested attrition increases of $83 million in2016 and $142 million in 2017. 
  The Utility requested that the CPUC authorize the Utility’s forecast of its 2015 weighted average rate base for its gas transmission and storagebusiness of $3.44 billion, which includes 
capital spending above authorized levels for the prior rate case period.     
The ORA has recommended a 2015 revenue r
equirement of $1.044 billion, an increase of $329 million over authorized amounts.  TURN recommended that the Utilitynot recover costs associa
ted with hydrostatic testing for pipeline segments placed in service after January 1, 1956, as well as certain other work that TURN considers to beremedial. 
    TURN also recommended the disallowance of about $200 million of capital expenditures incurred over the period 2011 through 2014 and recommended that about$500 million of capital 
expenditures during this period be subject to a reasonableness review and an independent audit.     TURN states that the Utility’s cost recovery should notbegin until the CPUC issues a decision on the 
independent audit. On December 18, 2015, the ORA filed a motion in the 2015 GT&S rate case for an Order to Show Cause why the Utility should not be sanct
ioned $163 million for intentional misrepresentations regarding its compliance with gas safety regulations regarding maximum allowable operatingpressure f 
or its gas transmission lin es. On December 30 , 2015, the Utility filed a response to this mo tion stating that it does not believe there is merit to the allegations. ORA filed a reply on January 11, 2016, r
eiterating its allegations. 
The Utility also has proposed chang
es to the revenue sharing mechanism authorized in the last GT&S rate case (covering 2011-2014) that subjected a portion of theUtility’s transportat
ion and storage revenue requirement to market risk.     The Utility proposed full balancing account treatment that allows for recovery of the Utility’sauthorized transporta
tion and storage revenue requirements (except for the revenue requirement associated with the Utility’s 25% interest in the Gill Ranch storage field).   
Based on the scoping ruling and procedu
ral schedule that was issued on June 11, 2015, the CPUC plans to issue an initial decision to authorize revenue requirementsfollowed by a second decision to r
educe the authorized revenue requirements by the costs of designated safety-related projects and programs up to the $850 million maximumcost disallowance imposed by th
e Penalty Decision. (See Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information about the CPUC’s Penalty Decision.)In accordance with an ea
rlier CPUC decision regarding the Utility’s violation of the CPUC’s ex parte communication rules made in the GT&S rate case, the first decision coulddisallow the Utility from 
recovering up to a five-month portion of the revenue increase that may otherwise have been authori zed. It is uncertain how much of th e Utility’s costs toperform the safety-related projects
 and programs the CPUC will identify as count ing toward the $850 million shareholder-funded obligation. If the Utility’s actu al costs exceedcosts that the CPUC counts towards the $850 mil
lion maximum, the Utility would record additional charges if such costs are not otherwise authorized by the CPUC.  Additionally, the Utility m
ay record additional charges if the CPUC does not authorize capital spending from the prior rate case period. The authorized revenue r equirements inthe GT&S rate case would be ret
roactive to January 1, 2015. The ruling states that the case would be completed wi thin 18 months of the date of the ru ling, or by December 2016.
 
FERC
TO
Rate
Cases
 
On September 30, 2015, the FERC approved a settle
ment that sets the Utility’s 2015 retail electric transmission revenue requirement at $1.201 billion, a $161 millionincrease over the currently a
uthorized revenue requirement of $1.040 billion. 
57

 On July 29, 2015, the Utility requested th
at the FERC approve a 2016 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.515 billion. The proposed amount reflects a$314 million increase ove
r the settled revenue requirement of $1.201 billion.  The Utility forecasts that it will make investments of $1.246 billion in 2016 in various capitalprojects.  The Utility’s fo
recasted rate base for 2016 is $5.85 billion, compared to forecasted rate base of $5.12 billion in 2015.  The Utility has requested that the FERC approvea 10.96% return on equity.  On Septembe
r 30, 2015, the FERC accepted the proposed revenue requirement, subject to hearing and refund, and established March 1, 2016 as theeffective date fo
r rate changes. Hearings are being held in abeyance pending settlement discussions among the parties. 
CPUC
Investigation
of
the
Utility’s
Safety
Culture
 
On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation 
into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritizesafety and adequately di
rect resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards. The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate the Utility’s and PG&ECorporation’s organizati
onal culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record of operations, including its record of safetyincidents. The CPUC authorized the SED to engage 
a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparation of a report containing the SED’s assessment. 
The CPUC stated that the initial ph
ase of the proceeding was categorized as rate setting because it will consider issues both of fact and policy and because the Utilityand PG&E Corporation do not face the prosp
ect of fines, penalties, or remedies in this phase. Upon completion of the consultant’s report, the assigned Commissioner willdetermine the scope of 
and next actions in the proceeding. The timing scope and potential outcome of the investigation are uncertain. 
Diablo
Canyon
Nuclear
Power
Plant
 
The NRC operating licenses for the 
two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon expire in 2024 and 2025.  In November 2009, the Utility filed an application with theNRC to seek the renewal of the opera
ting licenses, a process which can take several years.  After the March 2011 earthquake in Japan that damaged nuclear facilities, the NRCgranted the Utility’s r
equest to delay processing its renewal application until certain advanced seismic studies of the fault zones in the region surrounding Diablo Canyon werecompleted.  The seismic s
tudies have been completed and in September 2014, the Utility submitted a report to the NRC and the CPUC’s Independent Peer Review Panel(“IPRP”) that confirmed th
e seismic safety of the plant.  The IPRP is providing comments on the report and the Utility expects the IPRP to conclude their review and issue a finalreport in 2016.  In addition, the Ut
ility has requested that the California State Lands Commission extend the leases for the land occupied by Diablo Canyon’s water intake anddischarge structures f
rom the current expiration dates in 2018 and 2019 to 2024 and 2025 when the NRC operating licenses are currently due to expire.  The California StateLands Commission has deferred a
cting on the application until later in 2016.  It is uncertain whether the leases will be extended or whether an environmental review will berequired before the co
mmission can issue a decision. Finally, the California Water Board is not expected to issue a final decision before January 1, 2017 to address how theUtility’s nuclear oper
ations at Diablo Canyon must comply with the state’s policy regarding once-through cooling.  The Utility’s Diablo Canyon operations must be incompliance with the Cali
fornia Water Board’s policy by December 31, 2024.  Based on these and other factors, the Utility is continuing to assess its strategy for license renewalof Diablo Canyon.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors and 
“Environmental Regulation” in Item 1.  For a discussion of the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning obligations, see Note 2:Summary of Significant Account
ing Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
LEGISLATIVE
AND
REGULATORY
IN
ITIATIVES 
The California Legislatu
re and the CPUC have adopted requirements and policies to accommodate the growth in distributed electric generation resources (includingsolar installations), increase
 the amount of renewable energy delivered to customers, foster the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encouragethe use of electric v
ehicles, and promote customer energy efficiency and demand response programs.   In addition, the CPUC continues to implement state law requirements toreform electric rates to more closely
 reflect the utilities’ actual costs of service, reduce cross-subsidization among customer rate classes, implement new rules and rates for netenergy metering (which c
urrently allow certain self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate), and allow customers to have greatercontrol over their ene
rgy use.   CPUC proceedings related to some of these matters are discussed below. 
58

 In addition, prompted by a me
thane gas leak from a natural gas storage facility located in Southern California, the California Legislature has begun to consider adoptingnew legislation to address na
tural gas storage operations in California, including increased oversight of natural gas storage facilities and the adoption of new safety and reliabilitymeasures.  The California Gove
rnor also issued an emergency proclamation that requires various state agencies to take immediate action, as discussed below.  
The Utility’s ability to 
recover its costs, including investments associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as its electricity procurement and otheroperating costs, will, in la
rge part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjustedto reflect changes in 
customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service. 
Natural
Gas
Storage
Facilities
 
On January 6, 2016 the California Governor o
rder ed the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources ( “ DOGGR ” ) to issue emergency regulations to require gas storage facility ope
rators throughout California , including the Utility, to comply with new safety and re liability measures, including minimum daily inspection of gas storagewell heads (using gas leak det
ection technology such as infrared imaging), ongoing verification of the mechanical integrity of all gas storage wells, ongoing measurement ofannular gas pressure or annul
ar gas flow within wells, regular testing of all safety valves used in wells, establishing minimum and maximum pressure limits for each gas storagefacility in the sta
te, and establishing  a comprehensive risk management plan that evaluates and prepares for risks at each facility, including corrosion potential of pipes andequipment. 
  The Utility may incur significant costs to comply with the new regulations but anticipates that it would be able to recover such costs through rates.   
The DOGGR, the CPUC, the CARB, and the CEC will be required to submit to the Californ
ia Governor's Office a report that assesses the long-term viability of naturalgas storage facilities in 
California.  The report will address operational safety and potential health risks, methane emissions, supply reliability for gas and electricity demand inCalifornia, and the role
 of storage facilities and natural gas infrastructure in the State's long-term GHG emission reduction strategies. 
New
Renewable
Energy
Targets
 
In October 2015, the California Gove
rnor signed SB 350 which, effective January 1, 2016, increases the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by mostload-serving entities, 
including the Utility, to their customers from 33% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period to 50% of their totalannual retail sales by 
the end of the 2028- 2030 compliance period and in each compliance period thereafter.  SB 350 includes increasing interim renewable energy targets for theperiods between 2020 and 2030 and continues 
to include compliance flexibility and waiver mechanisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energyprocurement in one compl
iance period to future compliance periods.  The Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energytargets which the Utility 
expects will continue to be recoverable from customers as “pass-through” costs.  The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet thehigher targets.  The CPUC is required to op
en a new rulemaking proceeding to adopt regulations to implement the higher targets. 
Electric
Distribution
Resourc
es
Plan
 
As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, 
the Utility filed its proposed electric distribution resources plan for approval by the CPUC. The Utility’s plan identifiesoptimal locations on its 
electric distribution system for deployment of distributed energy resources.  The Utility’s proposal is designed to allow energy technologies to beinterconnected with each 
other and integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.   The Utility envisionsa future electri
c grid, titled the Grid of Things™, that would allow customers to choose new advanced energy supply technologies and services to meet their needs consistentwith safe, reliable and 
affordable electric service.  The Utility’s 2017 GRC includes a request to recover some of the investment costs that it forecasts it will incur under itsproposed electric dist
ribution resources plan.

 Electric
Rate
Reform
and
Net
Energy
Metering
(“NEM”) 
On July 3, 2015, the CPUC approved a final decision to au
thorize the California investor–owned utilities to gradually flatten their tiered residential electric ratestructures from four t
iers to two tiers by January 1, 2019.   The decision approved increased mini mum bill charges for residential customers and also allows the imposition of a surcharge on customers with ex
tremely high electricity use beginning in 2017.   The decision requires the Utility to file a proposal by January 1, 2018, to charge residentialelectric 
customers based on time-o f-use rates unless customers elect otherwise (known as “default time-of-use rates”).   The Utility also may propo se to impose a fixed charge on residential electric c 
ustomers.   Under the CPUC’s decision, default time-of-use rates must be implemented before the CPUC will permit the imposition of a fixed charge in electric rates 
.   
In January 2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules and rates. 
  The new rules and rates are expected t o become effective for new NEM customers of the Utility later in 2016. 
  New NEM customers will be required to pay an interconnection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be required to pay non-bypassable charges to help fund someof the costs of low income, ene
rgy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.   
Electric
Vehicle
(EV
)
Infrastructure
Development 
In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adop
ting a policy to expand the California utilities’ role in developing an EV charging infrastructure to supportCalifornia’s climate goals. 
  On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application requesting that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposal to deploy, own, and maintain more than25,000 EV charging stations and the assoc
iated infrastructure.   The Utility proposed to engage with third party EV equipment and service providers to oper ate and maintain thecharging stations.  The Utili
ty requested that the CPUC approve forecasted capital expenditures of $551 million over the 5 year deployment period. 
On September 4, 2015, the assigned CPUC Commissioner and th
e ALJ issued a scoping memo and procedural schedule that required the Utility to supplement itsapplication by submitting 
a more phased deployment approach that will be considered in a first phase of the proceeding.   On October 12, 2015, the Utility submittedsupplemental testimony p
resenting two separate proposals.  In its first proposal, the Utility has requested that the CPUC approve approximately $70 million in capitalexpenditures to deploy and own 2,510 EV charging s
tations over approximately 2 years. In its second proposal, the Util ity has requested that the CPUC approve approximately$187 million in capital 
expenditures to deploy and own 7,530 EV charging stations over approximately 3 years. Under the CPUC’s schedule, a proposed decision for the firstphase of the proceeding is exp
ected to be issued by June 2016. Further deployment of EV charging s tations would be considered in a second phase of the proceeding dependingon the outcome of the firs
t phase.   
ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
 
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of theUtility’s personnel and the pub
lic.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous wastes; the reportingand reduction of 
CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclearfuel.  (See 
Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Environmental Regulat ion” in Item 1 .)     
Natural
Gas
Compressor
Station
Sites

The Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas compressorstations. 
  The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment. At December 31, 2015 , $ 140 million and $ 300 million wasaccrued in the Consolidated Ba
lances Sheets for estimated undiscounted remediation costs associated with the Hinkley site and the Topock site, respectively.  Costs associatedwith the Hinkley site are not 
recovered through rates.  (See “Environmental Remedia tion Contingencies” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State ments in Item 8 
.)  
RISK
MANAGEMENT
ACTIVITIES
 
The Utility and PG&E Corporation, main
ly through its ownership of the Utility, are exposed to risks associated with advers e changes in commodity prices, interestrates, and counterparty 
credit. 
The Utility actively m
anages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reducecommodity cost volatil
ity, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non- speculative purposes ( i.e ., risk mitigation).  The Utility’s riskmanagement activi
ties include the use of energy and financial ins truments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements, most ofwhich are accounted for as d
erivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases. 
60

 Commodity
Price
Risk  
The Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and nuclearfuel necessary for el
ectricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers.  As long as the Utility can conclude that it is probable that its reasonably incurredwholesale electricity procurement
 costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices will not affect earnings . Such fluctuations,however, 
may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fully recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.  
The Utility’s 
current authorized revenue requ irement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected.   TheUtility recovers these 
costs through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts , resulting in price and volumetric risk. (See “ 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
” above . ) 
The Utility uses value-at
-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s va lue-at-risk was approximately $ 2 million and $1 million at December31 
, 2015 and 2014 , respectively .  During 2015 , t he Utility’s approximate high, low, and average values-a t-risk were $ 2 million, $ 1 million and $ 2 million, respectively.During 
2014 , the value-at-risk a mounts were $9 million, $1 million and $5 million, respectively .  ( See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of pr
ice risk management activities.) 
Interest
Rate
Risk
 
Interest rate risk s
ensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interestrates.  A 
t December 31 , 2015 and 2014 , if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt, and cashinvestments 
, th e impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $ 11 million and $9 million, respectiv ely, based on net variable rate  debt and other interest rate-sensitive instruments outs
tanding.   ( See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further disc ussion of interest rates .)  
Energy
Procurement
Credit
Risk 
The Utility conducts business with coun
terparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor- owned electric utilities,municipal utiliti
es, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas produc tion companies located in the United Statesand Canada.  If a c
ounterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then the Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas atcurrent market pri
ces, which may be higher than the contract prices. 
The Utility manages cred
it risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings,and other credit criteria as deeme
d appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  The Utility executes many energy contracts under master commodity enabling agreements that may
 require security (referred to as “Credit Collateral” in the table below).  Credit c ollateral may be in the form of cash or letters of credit.  The Utilitymay accept other forms of 
performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by theUtility).  Credit 
c ollateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current net receivables and replacement cost exposure exceed contractuallyspecified limits.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING
POL
ICIES
The preparation of Consolidat
ed Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estima tes and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts ofassets and liabiliti
es as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The accounting policies describedbelow are considered t
o be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and material to the financial position and resultsof operations of PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments and estimates.  Actual results may differ substantially fromthese estimates.  These 
policies and their key characteristics are outlined below. 
Regulatory
Accounting  
As a regulated entity, 
t he Utility records regulatory assets  and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probab le of recovery from, or refund to, customers. Theseamounts would otherwise be record
ed to expense or income under GAAP.  Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.  At December 31, 2015 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility repo rted regulatory assets (including current regulatory balancingaccounts receivable) of 
$ 9.3 billion and regulatory liabilities (incl uding current balancing accounts payable) of $ 7.7 billion .   
Determining probability re
quires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings,proposed regulatory decisions, 
final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals.  For some of the Utility’s regula tory assets,including 
utility retained generation , the Utility has determ ined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the CPUC . The Utility also records a regulatoryasset when a mechanism is in p
lace to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of incurred costs is probable, such as the r egulatory assets for 
pension benefits ; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.  The CPUC has not denied the recovery of any materialcosts previously recognized by 
the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented.  If the Utility determined that it is no longer probable th at regulatory assets would be recovered or refle
cted in future rates, or if the Utility ceas ed to be subject to rate regul ation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which thatdetermination was made. 
  I f regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results dueto the differences in 
the timing of expense or revenue recognition. 
In addition, regulatory a
ccounting standards require recognition of a   loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposesand if a reasonable est
imate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding probability of recovery, asdescribed above, and the ult
imate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected to exceed the amount to be recovered.  The Utility records a provis
ion based on its best estimate; to the extent there is a high degree of uncertainty in the Utility’s forecast, it will record a provision based on the lowerend of the range of possible loss
es.   The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included in third-partycontracts, historical cost e
xperience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors.   The Utility recordedcharges of 
$407 million in 2015 for estim ated capital spending that is probable of disallowance related to the Penalty Decision.  Management will continue to evaluate andestimate capita
l spending that may be probable of disallowance in future periods.  These estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final 2015 GT&S rate case decisionwhich is expected in 2016.  The Utili
ty also recorded $ 116 million and $ 196 million in 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively, for PSEP capital costs that are expected to exceed theamount to be recovered. 
  See “ Enforcement and Litiga tion Matters ” in Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated F inancial Statements in Item 8.  Management will continue toperiodically assess its 
safety-related capital costs and the r elated CPUC regulatory proceedings, and further charges could b e required in future periods.62

 Loss
Contingencies
 
Environmental
Remediation
Liabiliti
es
The Utility is subject to loss 
contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regu lations that in the future may require the Utility to pay forenvironmental remed
iation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party.  Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances atvarious potential sites, 
including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility fo r the storage, recycling, ordisposal of potentially ha
zardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site. 
The Utility generally co
mmences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potential siterequiring remedial action.  (I
n some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperation with regulatoryagencies.  For example, the Ut
ility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.)  Based on such notifica tion, the Utility completes an assessmentof the potential site and
 evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred.  The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when siteassessments indicate r
emediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses .  Given the complexities of the legal and regulatoryenvironment and the in
herent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requiressignificant judgment.  Key f
actors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies thatcan be used for remedia
tion, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from thirdparties.
 
When possible, the Utility es
timates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending on thelevel of information 
available.  Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who are expected todevote a significant amou
nt of time directly to the remediation effort.  These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions, operations andmaintenance activities, post reme
diation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.  Remediation efforts for a particular sitegenerally extend over a p
eriod of several years.  During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remedi
ation effort. 
At December 31, 
2015 and 2014 , the Utility ’s accruals for undiscount ed gross environmental liab ilities were $ 969 million and $ 954 million, respectively.  The Utility’s undiscounted futur
e costs c ould increase to as much as $ 1.9 billion if the extent of contaminatio n or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the otherpotentially responsible 
parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatory requirements. Although the Utility has provided fo
r known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may vary significantly from actual costs, andthe amount of additional 
future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. 
Legal
and
Regulatory
Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and lawsuits.  In addition, 
penalties may be incur red for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a provision fora loss 
contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate therange of reasonably esti
mated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range , unless an amount within the rang e is a better estimate than any other amount.  T he assessment of whether a loss 
is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about futureevents.  
Loss contingencies are rev iewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted t o reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, set tlements andpayments, rulings, advice of 
legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s policy is to excludeanticipated legal costs 
from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incur red .   (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” and “Legal and Regulatory Contingencies” inNote 13 
of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial Statements in Item 8.)63

  
Asset
Retirement
Obligations

PG&E Corporation and the 
Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable esti mate of fair value and its settlement date 
can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement c osts are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-livedasset.  
The Utility recognize s a regulatory asset or liabilit y for the timing differences b etween the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through th e ratemaking process.  (See Notes 
2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
To estimate 
its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant est imates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs, inflationrates, and the estimated date
 of decommissioning.  The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with thedecommissioning obligation. 
 
At December 31, 
2015 , the Utility’s recorded ARO for th e estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was $ 3.6 billion .   Changes in these estimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for thes e assets. For example, a prematur e shutdown of the nuclear facilities at Diablo Canyon would increase the like 
lihood of an earlier st art to decommissioning and cause an increase in the ARO.  I f the inflation adjustment or discount rate incre ased 25 basis points, the resultwould be an immaterial 
impact to ARO.  
Pension
and
Other
Postretirement
Benefit
 Plans 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
sponsor a non-contributory defined b enefit pension plan for eligible employees a s well as contributory postretirement health care and 
medical plans for eligible r etirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees .   Adjustmentsto the pension and other benef
it obligation are based on the d ifferences between a ctuarial assumptions and actual plan results .  These amounts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (los
s) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between p ension benefit expense recognized in accordan ce with GAAP and amountsrecognized for ratem 
aking purposes are recorded as regulatory asset s or liabilit ies as amounts are probable of recovery from customers.   To the extent the other ben efits are inan overfunded position, the Util
ity records a regulatory liability. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  
The pension and 
other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date.  The significant a ctuarial assumptions used in determin
ing pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care cost trend rateand the expected return on p
lan assets.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary .  While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe 
that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes or amendments, or significant changes in assumptionsmay materially affect the recorded pe
nsion and other postretirement benefit oblig ations and future plan expens es.  
I 
n establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider rec ent cost trends and projections from industry experts .  This evaluation suggests that current ra
tes of inflation are expected to continue in the near term.  In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the design of PG&ECorporation’s plans, the assumed h
ealth care cost trend rate for 2015 is 7.2 % , gradually decreasing to the u ltimate trend rate of 4 % in 2024 and beyond .  
Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then apply ing these returns to the target asset allocations of theemployee benefit trus
ts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Fixed - income returns were projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to along-term inflat 
ion rate.  Equity returns wer e projected based on estimates of divid end yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rate of inflation.  For the Utility’sdefined benefit pension pl
an, the assumed return of 6.1 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.8 % . 
The rate used to discount pension b
enefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 688 Aa-grade non-callable bondsat December 31, 
2015 .  This yield curve has discount r ates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension and otherpostretirement bene
fit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

NOTE
1:
ORGANIZATION
AND
BASIS
OF
PR
ESENTATION 
PG&E Corporation is a holding company 
whose primary operating subsidi ary is Pacific Gas and Electri c Company, a public utility operating in northern and centralCalifornia.  The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  The Utility is primarily regulated by the CPUC and the FERC.  In addition, the NRC oversees the lic
ensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.  
This is a combined annual repo
rt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s c onsolidated f inancial s tatements include the accounts of PG&ECorporation, the Utility, and oth
er wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The Utility’s c onsolidated f inancial s tatements include the accounts of the Utility and its whollyowned and controlled subsidiari
es.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated Financi al Statements apply to bothPG&E Corporation and the Utility.  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial perform ance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., the companies operate in one segment).
 
The 
accompanying c onsolidated f inancial s tatements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form 10-K. The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP require s the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenuesand expenses and the disclosure o
f contingent assets and liabilitie s. Some of the more significant estimates and assumption s relate to the Utility’s regulatory assets and li abilities,legal and regulatory conti
ngencies, environmental remediation liabi lities, ARO s, and pension and other postreti rement benefit plans obligations.  Management believes that itsestimates and assumptions 
reflected in the c onsolidated f inancial s tatements are appropriate and reasonable.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.83

  
NOTE

SUMMARY
OF
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUN
TING
POLICIES
Regulation
and
Regulated
Operations
 
The Utility follows accounting p
rinciples for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “re venue requirements” that have been authorized bythe CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of provid
ing service.  T he Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenue requirements through ratesis generally independent, o
r “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records as sets and liabilities that result from the regulatedratemaking process tha
t would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities. The Utility capitali zes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise becharged to expense if it 
is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs ex
pected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Utility records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  A mounts that are probable o
f being credited or refunded to customers in the future are also recorded as regulatory liabilities. 
The Utility also record
s a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that areprobable of recovery or r
efund.  In addition, t he Utility records a regulatory balancing acco unt asset or liability for differences between in curred costs and customer billings orauthorized revenue me
ant to recover those costs , t o the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund . These differences have no impact on net income.  (S ee “Revenue Recognition” below. 
)  
Management continues to be
lieve the use of regulatory accounting is applicable a nd that all regulatory assets and liabilitie s are recoverable or refundable.  To the extent that portions of th
e Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation or otherreasons, the related regulat
ory assets and liabilities are written off. 
Revenue
Recognition
 
The Utility 
recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas ser vices are delivered . The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energydelivered to customers bu
t not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Rates charged tocustomers are based on CPUC and FERC authorized rev
enue requirements. 
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility
’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three years.   T he Utility’s ability torecover r 
evenue requirements au thorized by the CPUC in these rates cases is independent, or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility’s sales of electricity and natural gasservices. 
  The U tility recognizes r evenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collectedwithin 24 months. 
  Generally, revenue is recognized ratably over the year.   
The CPUC also has authorized the Utility 
to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,including costs to purchase e
lectricity and natural gas; and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.   In general , the revenue recognition criteria for pass-t
hrough costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. 
The FERC authorizes the Utility’s r
evenue requirements in periodic (often annual) TO rate cases.   The Utility’s ability to recover revenue requirements authorized bythe FERC is dependent on the volume of the Ut
ility’s electricity sales, and revenue is recognized only for amounts billed and unbilled. 
C
ash
and
Cash
Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at fairvalue. 
 
84

 Restricted
Cash
 
Restricted cash consists pr
imarily of the Utility’s cash held in escrow pending the resolution of the remaining disputed claims made by electrici ty suppliers in theUtility’s proceeding under Chap
ter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  (See “ Resolution of Remaining Chapter 11 Disputed Claims” in Note 13 below .)  
Allowance
for
Doubtful
Accounts
Receivable

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value. The allowance is determine
d based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables , current economic condi tions, and assessment ofcustomer collectability.
 
Inventories

Inventories are carried at 
weighted- average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies .   Natural gas stored underground is recorded to 
inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribut ion to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.   Materials and suppliesare 
recorded to inventory when purchased and expens ed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed. 
Emission
Allowances
 
The Utility purchases GHG emission al
lowances to satisfy its compliance obligations. Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets – otherand other noncurrent assets – o
ther on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates. 
Property,
Plant,
and
Equipment
 
Property, plant, and equipment 
are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value .  Historical costs include labor and ma terials,construction overhead, and AFUDC.  
(See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful liv es and balances of its property, plant, and equipment were as follows:

Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory  is stated at weighted- average  cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is  used based on the amount of energy output.  (SeeNote 
13 below.) 
The Utility depreciat
es property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the grossinvestment 
balance in a particular cl ass of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property, plant, and equipment. The Utility’s co 
mposite depreciation rates were 3.80 % in 2015 , 3.77 % in 2014 , and 3.51 % in 2013 .   The useful lives of the Utility’s property, plant, and equipment areauthorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreci
ation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers.  Depreciation expense includes a component for theoriginal cost of assets and 
a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value at retirement.  Upon retirement, the original cost of the retired assets, net ofsalvage value, is charged 
against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements ofproperty, is charged to oper
ating and maintenance expense as incurred. 
85

 AFUDC
 
AFUDC 
represents the estimated cost s of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into servic e and is capitalized as part of the cost of constru
ction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed in service.  AFUDC relatedto the cost of debt is reco
rded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  The Utility recorded AFUDC related to debt and equity, respectively, 
of $ 48 million and $ 107 million during 2015 , $ 45 million and $ 100 million during 2014 , and $ 47 million and $ 101 million during 2013 .

   $ 3,575
   
The Utility has not recorded 
a liability related to certain ARO’s for assets that are expe cted to operate in perp etuity.  As t he Utility cannot estimate a settlement date orrange of potential set
tlement dates for these assets , reasonable estimate s of fair value cannot be made. As such, ARO liabilities are not re corded for retirement activitiesassociated with substations, photovo
ltaic facilities, and certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications equipment fromleased property; and res
toration or land to the conditions under certain agreements.   
Nuclear
Decommissioning
Obligation
 
Detailed studies of the cos
t to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the NuclearDecommissioning Cost Triennial Pro
ceeding conducted by the CPUC.  The decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for theUtility's nuclear power plan
ts.   Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatoryrequirements; techno
logy; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment. 
The Utility adjusts its nucl
ear decommissioning obligation to reflect changes in the estimated costs of decommissioning its nuclear power facilities and records this asan adjustment to the ARO liabil
ity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The total nuclear decommissioning obligation accrued was $ 2.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . The estimated undiscounted nu
clear decommissioning cost for the Utility’s nuclear power plants was $ 3.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (or $ 6.1 billion in futuredollars). 
These estimates are b ased on the 2012 decommissioning cost studies, prepared in accordance with CPUC requirements. 
86

 Disallowance
of
Plant
Costs
 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently comple ted plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  The Utility recorded charges of $407 million in 2015 for estimatedcapital spending that is p
robable of disallowance related to the Penalty Decision and $116 million and $196 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for PSEP capita l costs thatare expected to exce
ed the CPUC’s authorized levels or that are specifically disallowed.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 below). 
Nuclear
Decommissioning
Trusts

The Utility’s nuclear 
generation facilities consist o f two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the saferemoval of 
a nuclear generation facilit y from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release o f the propertyfor unrestricted use.  The Ut
ility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts until authorized for release by the CPUC .  
The Utility classifies 
its investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust s as “available-for-sale.”  Since the Utility’s nuclear d ecommissioning trust assets aremanaged by external inves
tment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses are considered other-than-temporary impairm
ents.  Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, from customers through rates. Therefore, trust earnings are def
erred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact on the Utility’s earnings or accumulated othercomprehensive income.  The 
cost of debt and equity securiti es sold by the trust is determined by specif ic identification. 
Variable
Interest
Entities
 
A VIE is an entity that does not have su
fficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whoseequity investors lack a
ny characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiary and is requiredto consolidate the VIE. 
 
Some of the counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power pl ant that would generateelectricity for sale to the Utilit
y.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary benefic iary of any of these VIE s at December 31, 2015, it assessed whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s expected losses or r
eceives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement , analyzed the variability in th e VIE’sgross margin 
, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most significant to the VIE’s performance, such as dispatch rightsand operating and mainten
ance activities. T he Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amount the Utility pays for delivered ele ctricity and capacity.  The Utility did nothave any decision-making r
ights associated with any of the activities that are most significant to the economic performance of any of these VIEs .  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of 
any of these VIEs at December 31, 2015 , it did not consolidate any of them .

In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUC authorized the Utilityto
 recover  $1.2  billion  of  costs  related  to  the  Utility’s  retained  generation  assets.   The  individual  components  of  these  regulatory  assets  are  being  amortized  over  the  respective  lives  of  the  underlyinggeneration facilities, consistent with the period over which the related revenues are recognized.

Represents the expected future recovery of the net book value of electromechanical meters that were replaced with SmartMeter™ devices. As  of December 31, 2015, the remaining balance of $70 million isincluded in current regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(4) 
Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements. As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, t he  Utility expects to continuouslyrecover pension benefits.
 
In general, the Utility do
es not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do not accrue interest.  Accordingly, the Utility earns a return only on its regulatoryassets for retained generatio
n, regulatory assets for electromechanical meters, and regulatory assets for unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.

NOTE

INCOME
TAXES

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The i ncome tax provision includes current and def erred income taxesresulting from operat
ions during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility est imate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and l
iabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation expense. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will be sustainedupon examination by taxing autho
rities based on the merits of the position.  T he tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based on the largest amount ofbenefit that is greater than 
50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, t he difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in future periods 
and the benefit recogni zed and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecogniz ed tax benefit.  
Investment tax credits are deferre
d and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investment recoveryperiod. 
  The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment. 
PG&E Corporation files a consolida
ted U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more.  PG&ECorporation files a combin
ed state income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under which the Utility determinesits income tax provision (b
enefit) on a stand-alone basis.

The component of unrecognized 
tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2015 for PG &E Corporation and the Utility was $ 50 
million .  
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s un
recognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months due to the resolution of several matters, includingaudits. 
  As of December 31, 2015, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $ 60 million within the next 12 months. 
Interest income, int
erest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  For t he years ended December 31, 2015 
, 2014, and 201 3 , these amounts were immaterial. 
101

 IRS
settlements
 
PG&E Corporation participated 
in the Compliance Assurance Process in 2015, a real-time IRS audit intended to expedite resolution of tax matters.  The ComplianceAssurance Process audit culmin
ates with a letter from the IRS indicating its acceptance of the return. 
PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have b
een accepted through 2014 except for a few matters, the most significant of which relates to deductible repair costs.  InDecember 2015, PG&E Corporation reach
ed an agreement with the IRS on deductible repair costs for the 2011 tax year, subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Deductible repair costs wi
ll continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for subsequent years.  The IRS is expected to issue guidance in 2016 that clarifies which repair costsare deductible for th
e natural gas transmission and distribution businesses.  T ax years after 2004 remain  subject to examination by the state of California.

PG&E Corporation believes it is mo
re likely than not the tax benefits associated with the federal and California net operating loss es, charitable contr ibutions and tax credits can be real
ized within the carryforward periods, therefore no valuation allowance was recognized as of December 31, 201 5 for these tax attribu tes.   As of December 31,2015 
, PG&E Corporation had approximately $ 29 million of f ederal net operating loss carry forwards related to the tax benefit on employee stock plans that would be recordedin additional paid-in c
apital when used. 
NOTE

DERIVATIVES

Use
of
Derivative
Instruments
 
The Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities.  Procurement costs are recovered through customerrates.  The Utility uses both de
rivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.  Derivatives include forwardcontracts, swaps, futures, options, 
and CRRs. 
Derivatives are pres 
ented in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets on a ne t basis in accordance with master netting arrangements for each counterparty.  The fairvalue of derivative ins
truments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offset exist.   
Price risk management 
activities that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These instruments are not heldfor speculative purpose
s and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Utility expects to fully recover in rates all costs related to derivatives as long as the currentratemaking mechanism remains in
 place and the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.  Therefore, all unrealized gainsand losses associated with the 
change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated BalanceSheets.  Net realized gains o
r losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electricity or the cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases toregulatory balancing a
ccounts for recovery from or refund to customers.102

  
The Utility elects the no
rmal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives.  Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that areexpected to be used by the Util
ity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commodity delivered.  Theseitems are not reflected in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Eligible derivatives are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting.

( 
2) These amounts are fully passed through to customers in rates.  Accordingly, net income was not impacted by realized amounts on these instruments. 
Cash inflows and outflows associated with d
erivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
The majority of the Util
ity’s derivatives contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies.  AtDecember 31, 
2015 , the Utility’s credit rating was investment grade.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to postadditional cash immediately to 
fully collateralize some of its net liabilit y derivative positions. 
T 
he additional cash collateral that the Utility would be required to post if the credit risk-related contingency features were triggered was as follows:

FAIR
VALUE
MEASUREMENTS 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their cash equivalents, trust assets, price risk management instruments , and other investments at fair value.  A three-tier fair value hierarchy is est
ablished that prioritizes th e inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value :  
Level


1
–
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
Level


2
–
Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 
Level


3
–
Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities. 
The fair value hiera
rchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Valuation
Techniques
 
The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabi lities shown in the tables abov e.  I nvestments, primarily consisting of equity securi
ties , that are valued using a net asset value per share can be redeemed quart erly with notice not to exceed 90 days.  Equity investments valued at netasset value per share utilize
 investment strategies aimed at matching the performance of indexed funds.  Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as ofthe end of the reporting pe
riod.   There were no material transfers between any levels for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .

 Trust
Assets
 
N 
uclear decommissioning trust assets and other trust asse ts are composed primarily of equity se curities and debt securities.  In gene ral, investments held in the trustsare exposed to various risks, such 
as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks. 
Global e 
quity securities prim arily include i nvestments in common stock th at are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.  Equitysecurities also includ
e commingled funds that are composed of equity securit ies traded publicly on exchanges across multiple industry sectors in the U.S. and other regions of theworld 
. Investments in these funds a re classified as Level 2 because price quotes are readily observabl e and available. 
Debt securities are pr
imarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including corporate debtsecurities.  U.S. government and ag
ency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is determined by observablemarket prices in active markets.
  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2 using evaluated pricing da ta such as broker quotes, for similar secu
rities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads. The external credit 
ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation model, as applicable. 
Price
Risk
Management
Instruments

Price risk management 
instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, swaps, options, and CRRs that aretraded either on an exch
ange or over-the-counter.  
Power purchase agreements, fo
rwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded forwards and swaps that are valued usingobservable market forwa
rd prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded forwardsand swaps 
, or are valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued usingobservable market data and
 market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.   
Long-dated power purchase agre
ements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued using eitherestimated basis adjust
ments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a period for whichmarket data is available. 
  Market and credit risk ma nagement utilizes mod els to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instruments using pricing inputs from br 
okers and historical data.  
The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financ
ial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISOauction and between auction d
ates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to f orecast forward prices . CRRs are classified as Level 3.

Measurements
and
Sensitivity
Analysis
 
The Utility’s market and 
credit risk m anagement function, which reports to the Chi ef Risk and Audit Officer of the Utility, is responsible for deter mining the fair valueof the Utility’s price 
risk manag ement derivatives.  The Ut ility’s finance and risk management func tions collaborate to determine the ap propriate fair value methodologies andclassification for 
each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determinereasonableness.
 
Significant increases o
r decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reason able costs related to Level 3instruments are expec
ted to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact  to net income resulting from changes in the fair value of these instruments.   (See Note

Financial
Instruments

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments: 
The fair values of cash 
, restricted cash , net accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, floating rate senior no tes, and the Utility’s variable r
ate pollution control bond loan agreement s approximate their carrying values at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , as they are short-term in nature orhave interest rates 
that reset daily .   
The fair values of the Uti
lity’s fixed - rate senior notes and fixed - rate pollution control bond s and PG&E Corporation’s fixed - rate senior notes were based on quoted market prices 
at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re

as components of accumula ted other comprehensive income, net of tax .  In addition, regulatory ad justments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income andConsolidated Balance Sheets to r
eflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP for accounting purposes and expense or income forratemaking purposes, which is bas
ed on authorized plan contributions.   For pension benefits, a regulatory asset or liability is recorded for amounts that would otherwise berecorded to accumulated other
 comprehensive income.   For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utility generally records a regulatory liability for amounts that wouldotherwise be recorded to a
ccumulated other comprehensive income.   As the Utility is unable to record a regulatory asset for these other benefits, the charge remains inaccumulated other co
mprehensive income (loss).

The assumed health

Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit 
plan trusts, resulting in a weight ed average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based on re al maturityand credit spreads added to 
a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on es timates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to along-term inflation 
rate .  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 6.1 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.8 %.  The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefit 
s was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 688 Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2015 .  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on th
e duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension benefits and other benefit obliga tions were matched to the correspondingrates on the yield curve 
to derive a weighted average discount rate. 
Investment
Policies
and
Strategies
 
The financial position of PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations. Volatility in funde 
d status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial reporting , as well as the amount of minimum contributions r
equired under the Employee Retirement In come Security Act of 1974, as amended .  P G&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investment policies andstrategies are designed to
 increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of funded status volatility.  
The trusts 
’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings .   Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes also influenceliability valuations 
as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility , PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trust s hold significant alloc ations in long maturity 
fixed-income investments . A lthough they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-term funding costs due to their higherexpected return.  
Real assets and absolute return invest ments are held to diversify the trust ’s holdings in equity and fixed- income investments by exhibiting returns with lowcorrelation to the direction 
of these markets. R eal assets include commodities futures, REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  Absolute returninvestments include hedge 
fund portfolios .  
113

 T 
arget allocations for equity investments have generally declined in favor of longer-maturity fixed-income investments and real assets as a means of dampening f uture funded status volatility.  
Derivative instruments su ch as equity index futures are used to meet targ et equity exposure.  In addition, derivative instruments such as equity index futures and U.S. treasury futures 
are used to rebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio.  Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used to hedgea portion of the non U.S. dollar exposure o
f global equity investments .

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply 
a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guidingprinciples of this risk m
anagement framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability anddocumentation.  Trust invest
ment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversif ication, manage risk through appropriate useof physical direct asse
t holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.

 Valuation
Techniques
 
The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.   All investments that ar e valuedusing a net asset value per sh
are can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days. 
Short-Term
Investments

Short-term investments 
consist primarily of comming led funds across government, credi t, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 andLevel 2 assets.

Global
Equity
 
The global equity 
category include s investments in common stock , equity-index futures, and commingled funds comprised of equity securities spread across multiple industries and regions of the wor
ld.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on public exchanges and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  These equityinvestments are gener
ally valued based on unadjusted prices in active mar kets for identical securities.   Equity-index futures are valued based on unadjusted p rices in activemarkets and are Level 1 
assets .  Commingled equity funds are valued using a net asset valu e per share and are maintained by investmen t companies for large institutionalinvestors and are not public
ly traded.  Commingled equity funds are comprised prim arily of underlying equity securities that are publicly traded on exchanges, and price quotesfor the assets held by these 
funds are readily observable and available.  Commingled equity funds are categorized as Level 1 and Level 2 assets.  
Absolute
Return
 
The absolute return cat
egory includes portfolios of hedge funds that are valued using a net asset value per sh are based on a variety of propri etary and non-proprietaryvaluation methods, including un
adjusted prices for publicly-traded securities in active markets.  Hedge funds are considered Level 3 assets.
Real
Assets
 
The real asset 
category includes portfo lios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infr astructure equities, and private real esta te funds.  The commodityfutures, 
global REITS, and global listed inf rastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  Private real estate funds arevalued using 
a net asset value per sha re derived using appraisals, pricing models , and valuation inputs that are unobservable and are considered Level 3 assets.   
Fixed-Income

The fixed-income cat
egory includes U.S. government securities, corporate securities, and other fixed-income securities.  
U.S. government fixed-income pr
imarily consists of U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. government bonds that are valued based on quoted market prices or evaluated pricingdata for similar securities adju
sted for observable differences.  These securities are categorized as Level 1 or Level 2 assets.  
Corporate fixed-income p
rimarily includes investment grade bonds of U.S. issuers across multiple industries that are valued based on a compilation of primarilyobservable information o
r broker quotes in non-active markets.  The fair value of corporate bonds is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations(where observable), bond spreads o
r credit default swap spreads obtained from independent external parties such as vendors and brokers adjusted for any basis differencebetween cash and derivativ
e instruments.  These securities are classified as Level 2 assets.  Corporate fixed-income also includes commingled funds that are valued using a net asset value per share and 
are comprised of corporate debt instruments .  Commingled funds are considered Level 2 ass ets.  Corporate fixed-income also includes privately placed debt portfolios which are va
lued using a net asset value per share using pricing models and valuation inputs that are unobservable and are considered Level 3 assets.   
Other fixed-income pri
marily includes pass-through and asset-backed securities.  Pass-through securities are valued based on observable market inputs and are Level 2assets.  Asset-backed securi
ties are primarily valued based on broker quotes and are considered Level 2 assets.  Other fixed-income also includes municipal bonds and Treasury futures.  Municipal bonds are v
alued based on a compilation of primarily observable information or broker quotes in non-active markets and are considered Level 2 assets. Futures are valued based on unadjus
ted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.

Employer
Contributions

PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
ributed $ 334 million to the pension benefit plans and $ 61 million to the other benefit plans in 2015 .  These contributions are consistent with PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicable regulatory decisionsand federal minimum 
funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirement requiring a cash contribution in 2015 .  The Utility’s pension benefits 
met all the funding requirements under ERISA.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 327 millionand $ 
61 million to the pension plan and other postret irement benefit plans, respectively, for 2016 .

Communication
Rules 
During 2014 and 2015, the Utility filed s
everal reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex partecommunications that e
ither should not have been made or that should have been timely reported to the CPUC. Ex parte communications include communications between adecision maker or a Commiss
ioner’s advisor and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings. Certain communications are prohibited andothers are permissibl
e with proper noticing and reporting. 
On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Uti
lity should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule 1.1 ofthe CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure gov
erning the conduct of those appearing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications the Utility reported to theCPUC.  The OII also cites the ex parte vio
lations alleged in the City of San Bruno’s July 2014 motion, which it filed in the CPUC investigations related to the Utility’s naturalgas transmission pipeline op
erations and practices.  A prehearing conference in the OII has been scheduled for March 1, 2016. 
The CPUC will determine any penalti
es that might be imposed on the Utility and determine whether shareholders or ratepayers will bear the costs of the investigation.The CPUC can impose fines up to $50,000 for each vio
lation, per day. The CPUC has wide discretion to determ ine the amount of penalties based on the totality of thecircumstances, includ
ing such factors as how many days each violation cont inued; the gravity of the viola tions; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number ofpersons affected; and th
e good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC is also required to consider theappropriateness of the a
mount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.  The CPUC has historically exercised this discretion in determining penalties.   
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve it is probable that the CPUC will impose penalties on the Utility in the OII but they are unable to re asonably estimate theamount or range of future 
charges that could be incurred , because i t is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number o f violations or the penalty for any violations, andwhether the CPUC will 
consider additional communications in the OII, including those identified in a motion filed on Decembe r 1, 2015, by the City of San Bruno in the 2015GT&S rate case 
.  It is also uncertain wheth er the CPUC will take additional action in any of the proceedings in which the Utility has self-reported communications that may have violated the CPUC’s ex parte ru
les . 
Finally, t 
he U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General’s office also have been inv estigating matters related to allege dly impropercommunications 
between the Utility and CPUC personnel .   The Utility is cooperating with the federal and state investigators.   It is uncertain whether any charges will bebrought against the Utility

 Record-Keeping 
On November 20, 2014, the CPUC began an investigation into whe
ther the Utility violated applicable laws pertaining to record-keeping practices with respect tomaintaining safe oper
ation of its natural gas distribution service and facilities.  The order also requires the Utility to show cause why (1) the CPUC should not find that the Utilityviolated provisions of the Cal
ifornia Public Utilities Code, CPUC general orders or decisions, other rules, or requirements, and/or engaged in unreasonable and/or imprudentpractices relat
ed to these matters, and (2) the CPUC should not impose penalties, and/or any other forms of relief, if any violations are found.  In particular, the order cites theSED’s investigative reports a
lleging that the Utility violated rules regarding safety record-keeping in connection with six natural gas distribution incidents, including the naturalgas explosion that occurred 
in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014, for which the CPUC has previously imposed a penalty of $10.85 million.  
On September 30, 2015, the SED submitted its suppl
emental testimony, which included incidents allegedly related to record-keeping that had not been identified in theinitial order, and also a
sserted violations related to the Utility’s pre-excavation location and marking practices, causal evaluation practices, and compliance with regulations governing pressure validat
ion for certain distribution facilities.  Evidentiary hearings were h eld during January 2016.  Opening briefs are due by February 26, 2016 and replybriefs are due by March 31, 2016.  The SED has ind
icated it will seek significant penalties, the amount of which is expected to be disclosed in its brief.119

  
P 
G&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that the CPUC will impose penalties on the Utility in the form of fines or oth er remedies, including possiblefuture 
unrecoverable costs to im plement operational remedies. The Utility is unable to determine the form o r amount of penalties or reasonably estimate the amount or range offuture charges that cou
ld be incurred given the CPUC’s wide discretion (discussed above) .  
Natural
Gas
Transmission
Pipeline
Rights-of-Way


 
In 2012, the Utility notified 
the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address a self-reported violation whereby 
the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipeline rights-of-way.  The Utility also submitted 
a proposed compliance plan that set forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachments over a multi-year period and topay penalties if the propos
ed milestones were not met.   In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey has been completed and that remediation work, includingremoval of the encroa
chments, is expected to continue for several years. The SED has not addressed the Utility’s proposed compliance plan, and it is reasonably possible that theSED will impose fines on the Utility o
r take other enforcement action in the future based on the Utility’s failure to continuously survey its system and remove encroachments. The Utility is unable to re
asonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the SED’s wide discretion and the number of factors that can beconsidered in determin
ing penalties. 
Potential
Safety
Citations

  
  The SED periodically audits utility operating practices and conducts investigations of potential violations of laws and regulations applicable to the safety of theCalifornia utilities’ electric and 
natural gas facilities and operations.   In addition, the California utilities are required to inform the SED of self-identified or self-correctedviolations. 
The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issu e citations and impose fines for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.   T he SEDcan consider the discre
tionary factors discussed above (see “ Order Instituting an Invest igation into Compliance with Ex parte Communication Rules ” above) in determining the number of violations and whethe
r to impose daily fines for continuing violations. The SED is r equired, however, to impose the maximum st atutory penalty of $50,000 for eachseparate violation 
.  
The SED has imposed fines on the Utility 
ranging from $50,000 to $16.8 million for violations of electric and natural gas laws and regulations.   The Utility believes itis probable that the SED will impos
e fines or take other enforcement action based on some of the Utility’s self-reported non-compliance with laws and regulations or based onallegations of non-compl
iance with such laws and regulations that are contained in some of the SED’s audits. The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range offuture charges that cou
ld be incurred for fines imposed by the SED with respect to these matters given the wide discretion the SED has in determining whether to bringenforcement action and the 
number of factors that can be considered in determining the amount of fines. 
Federal
Matters
 
Federal
Criminal
Indictment
 
On July 29, 2014, a federal grand jury fo
r the Northern District of California returned a 28-count superseding criminal indictment against the Utility in federal districtcourt that 
superseded the original indictm ent that was returned on April 1, 2014.  The superseding indictment charges 27 felony counts alleging that the Utility knowingly andwillfully violated min
imum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integrity management, and identification of pipelinethreats.  The superseding indi
ctment also includes one felony count charging that the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB’s investigation into the cause of the San Brunoaccident.  
On December 23, 2015, the court presid ing over the federal criminal pro ceeding dismissed 15 of the Pipe line Safety Act counts, leaving 13   remaining counts.  Themaximum statutory fin
e for each felony count is $500,000, for total potential fines of $6.5 million. On December 8, 2015, the court also issued an order granting, in pa rt, theUtility’s request to dism
iss the government’s allegations seeking an alternative fine under the Alternative Fines Act . The Alternative Fines Act states, in part: “If any personderives pecuniary gain f
rom the offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not more than the greater oftwice the gross gain or twice 
the gross loss.”   The court dismissed the government’s allegations regarding the amount of losses, but concluded that it required additionalinformation about how the govern
ment would prove its allegations about the amount of gross gains prior to deciding whether to dismiss those allegations.  (Based on thesuperseding indictment’s 
allegation that the Utility derived gross gains of approximately $281 million, the potential maximum alternative fine would be approximately $562million.) 
  After considering the additional information submitted by the government, on Feb ruary 2, 2016, the court issued an order holding that if the gov ernment’s allegationsabout the Utility’s gross gains 
are considered, they would be considered in a second trial phase that would take place after th e trial on the crim inal charges.   The trial on the criminal charges currently 
is scheduled to begin March 22 , 2016.120

  
The Utility entered a pl
ea of not guilty.     The Utility believes that criminal charges and the alternative fine allegations are not merited and that it did not knowingly andwillfully violate min
imum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act or obstruct the NTSB’s investigation, as alleged in the superseding indictment.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e not accrued any charges for criminal fines in their Consolidated Financial Statements as such amounts are not considered to be probable.

On Ap 
ril 9, 2015, the CPUC approved final decisions in the th ree investigations that had been brought against the Utility re lating to (1) the Utility’s safety record - keeping for its natural g
as transmission system, (2) the Utility’s operation of its natural gas transmission pipeline system in or near locations of higher population density, and (3)the Utility’s pipeline 
installation, integrity management, record - keeping and other operational practices, and other events or courses of conduct, that could have led to orcontributed to the natur
al gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010.  A decision was issued in each investigative proceeding todetermine the viola
tions that the Utility committed.  The CPUC also approved a fourth decision (the “Penalty Decision”) which imposes penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6billion c 
omprised of: (1) a $300 mil lion fine to be paid to the State General Fund, (2 ) a one-time $400 million bill credit to the Utility’s natural gas customers, (3) $850 millionto fund future pipeline sa
fety projects and programs, and (4) remedial measures that the CPUC estimates will cost the Utility at least $50 million. In August 2015, the Utility paid the $300 million fine. At Dece
mber 31, 2015, the Consolidated Balance Sheets include $400 million in current regulatory liabilities for the one-time bill credit that will beprovided to the Utility’s na
tural gas customers in 2016.  On January 14, 2016, the CPUC issued final decisions to c lose these investigative proceedings. 
The Penalty Decision requires 
that at least $689 million of the $850 million disallowance be allocated to capital expenditures, and that the Utility be precluded fromincluding these capita
l costs in rate base.  The CPUC will determine which safety projects and programs will be funded by shareholders in the Utility’s pending 2015 GT&S ratecase.  If the $850 million 
is not exhausted by designated safety-related projects and programs in the 2015 GT&S proceeding, the CPUC will identify additional projects in futureproceedings to ensure that 
the full $850 million is spent. The CPUC is expected to issue a final decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case in 2016 to identify safety-relatedprojects and programs tha
t will be subject to the disallowance. It is uncertain how much of the Utility’s costs to perform the safety-related projects and programs the CPUC willidentify as counting toward th
e $850 million shareholder-funded obligation. If the Utility’s actual costs exceed costs that the CPUC counts towards the $850 million maximum,the Utility would record addi
tional charges if such costs are not otherwise authorized by the CPUC.  As a result, the total shareholder-funded obligation could exceed $850million.

 For the year ended December 31, 2015, 
the Utility recorded additional charges in operating and maintenance expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income of$907 million as a result of

The Penalty Decision prohibits the Utility from recovering certain expenses and capital spending associated with pipeline safety-related projects and prog rams that the CPUC will identify in the final decis ionto be issued in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate c 
ase.   The Utility estimates that approximately $407 mi llion of capital spending (which include less than $1 million for remedy related capital costs) in the yearended December 31, 2015 is probable of disallowance, subject to adjustment 
based on the final 2015 GT&S rate case decision. (3) 
These costs are being expensed as incurred. Future GT&S revenues will be reduced for these unrecovered expenses.(4) 
In the Penalty Decision, the CPUC estimated that the Utility would incur $50 million to comply with the remedies specified in the Penalty Decision and does not reflect the Utility’s remedy-related costsalready incurred nor the Utility’s estimated future remedy-related costs. These costs are being expensed as incurred 
.  
Other
Legal
and
Regulatory
Contingencies 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims andlawsuits.  In addition, 
penalties may be incurred for failure to comply wi th federal, state, or local laws and regulations.   A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has be
en incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimatedlosses and 
record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably poss
ible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies a 
re reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect t he impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, set tlements and payments, rulings, advice oflegal counsel, and other in
formation and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s po licy is to exclude anticipated legal costs from the provision for loss and expense thes
e costs as incurred.

 Investigation
of
the
 Butte
Fire 
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(known as the “Butte f ire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.   The California Department ofForestry and Fire Protection (
“Cal Fire”) is i nvestigating the source of the Butte F ire to determine whether a tree contacted a power line operated by the Utility and was thecause of the fire.  
Cal Fire has reported that as a result of the fire there were two deaths and 965 structures, including 571 houses, were damaged or destroyed. Cal Fire’s investigation is expect
ed to conclude in 2016.     
Approximately 27 complaints h
ave been filed against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in both the County ofCalaveras and the County of San Francis
co, involving more than 600 individual plaintiffs and their insurance companies. Plaintiffs and the Utili ty filed petitions with theCalifornia Judicial Counci
l to coordinate these cases.  The petitions were assigned to the Calaveras Superior Court for a recommendation to the Judicial Council.  On January 21,2016, the Calaveras Superior Court issu
ed an order recommending to the Judicial Council that the cases be coordinated in the Superior Court of California, Sacramento County,for all purposes including t
rial.  Among other factors, the Court found that coordination requires a court with a significant number of judges and complex litigation supportpersonnel, neither of which a
re present in Calaveras County. 
It is estimated tha
t losses related to structures, contents, other personal property, and fire suppression costs associated with the Butte fire, will range from $350 millionto 
$450 million.  This range is based on estimates about the number, size, and type of structures damaged or destroyed, assumptions about the contents of such structures andother personal property da
mage, and information about the amount of fire suppression costs asso ciated with prior simi lar fires.  Th e Utility believes that it is reasonably possiblethat it would be liable fo
r some or all of these and other costs, such as costs associated with tree damage, personal injury, business interruption losses, and other damages.  The Utility is unable to reason
ably estimate these other costs at this time due to the limited information available.     
The Utility has insurance cov
erage for these types of claims. If the amount of insurance is insufficient to cover the Utility's liability resulting from the Butte fire, or ifinsurance is otherwise unava
ilable, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected. 
Rehearing
of
CPUC
Decisions
Approving
Energy
Efficiency
Incentive
Awards

On September 17, 2015, the CPUC issued an order granting TURN’s and th
e ORA’s long-standing applications for rehearing of the CPUC decisions th at awardedenergy efficiency incentive pa
yments to the California investor-owned utilities for the 2006-2008 energy effi ciency program cycle.   Under the ratemaking mechanism applicableto the 2006-2008 program cycle, 
the maximum amount of incentives that the Utility could have earned (or the maximum amount tha t the Utility could have been required toreimburse customers) ov
er the 2006-2008 program cycle was $180 million.   The Utility was awarded a total of $104 million for the 2006-2008 program cycle.   In the re-openedenergy efficiency pro
ceeding, the CPUC will evaluate whether incentives awarded to the California investor-owned utilities were just and reasonable, and whether any refundsare due.  The parties ar
e required to submit proposals to resolve the issues in the proceeding by March 18 , 2016.   Comments on the proposals are due on April 8 , 2016 and evidentiary hearings, i
f needed, would be held in July 2016.   It is uncertain when the CPUC will issue a decision and whether the Utility will be required to refund amounts orincur other obligations r
elated to the 2006-2008 program cycle.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is reasonably possible that the Utility will be required to refundamounts 
or incur other obligatio ns related to this matter, but they are unable to re asonably estimate the amount of such refunds or other obligations. 
Other
Contingencies
 
Accruals for other lega
l and regulatory contingencies (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” and“Other Legal and Regulatory Conting
encies” ) totaled $ 63 million at December 31 , 2015, and $55 million at December 31, 2014.  Th ese amounts are included in other currentliabilities in the Consol
idated Balance Sheets.  The resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, or cash flows.123

 Environm
ental
Remediation
Contingencies  
Given the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remediation liabilities is
 subjective and requires significant judgment.   The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicatethat remediation is p
robable and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts.  The Utility records an envi ronmental remediation liability based onthe lower end of the range of 
estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.   Amounts recorded are not discounted totheir present value.  The Ut
ility’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is composed of thefollowing:

At 
December 31, 2015 the Utility expected to recover $ 695 million of its environmental remediation liability through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by theCPUC.  One of these mechanisms allows the Util
ity rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites (including the Topock site)without a reasonableness rev
iew. T he Utility may incur environmental remediation costs that it does not seek to recover in rates, such as the co sts associated with the Hinkley site.
 
Natural
Gas
Compressor
Station
 Sites
The Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural g as compressorstations.  One of these stations 
is located near Hinkley, California and is referred to below as the “Hinkley site.”  Another station is located near Needles, California and isreferred to below as the 
“Topock site.” The Utility is also requir ed to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment. 
Hinkley
Site
 
The Utility has been imple
menting interim remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume and to monitor and control movement ofthe plume. 
The Utility’s remedia tion and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the Regional Board.   O n November 4, 201 5 , theRegional Board 
adopted a final clean-up and abatement order to contain and remedia te the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the po tential environmental impacts.  
The final order states that the Utility must continue and improve its r emediation efforts; define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action. Additionally, the final ord
er requires set ting plume capture requirements, requires establish ing a monitoring and reporting program , and finalizes deadlines for the Utili ty tomeet interim cleanup targets.  
The clean-up and abatem ent order did not have a material impact on the Utility’s consolidated financial statements. 
The Utility’s environment
al remediation liability at December 31, 201 5 reflects the Utility’s best estimate of probable future costs associated with its final remediationplan. 
  Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work to be perform ed to implement the f inal remediation plan and the Utility’s requir ed time frame forremediation.  
Future changes in cost estim ates and the assumptions on which they are based may have a material impact on future financial condition and cash flows. 
124

 Topock
Site
 
The Utility’s remediation a
nd abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regu latory authority of the California D epartment of T oxic S ubstances C ontroland the U.S. Department of the Int
er ior.  I n November 201 5 , the Utility submitted its final remediation design to the agencies for approv al.  The Utility’s design proposes that the Utility construct an 
in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic and non-soluble form of chromium.  The DTSC is conducting anadditional environment
al review of the proposed design , and the Utility anticip ates that the DTSC’s draft environmental impact report will be issued for public comment in July2016.  After the DTSC considers public comm
ents that may be made, the DTSC is expected to issue a final environmental impact report in December 2016.  After the Utilitymodifies its 
design in response to the final r eport, the Utility plans to seek approval to begin construction of the new in-situ treatment system in early 2017.   
The Utility’s environment
al remediation liability at December 31, 2015 reflects its best estimate of pr obable future costs associated with its final remediation plan. Future costs will depend on many fa
ctors, including the extent of work to be perform ed to implement the final groundwater remedy and the Utility’s required time frame forremediation.  
Future changes in cost estim ates and the assumptions on which they are based may have a material impact on future financial condition and cash flows. 
Reasonably
Possible
Environmental
Contingencies

Although the Utility has provided fo
r known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the Utility’s undiscounted fu ture costs couldincrease to as much as $ 
1.9 billion (including amounts rela ted to the Hinkley and Topock sites described above ) if the extent of cont amination or necessary remediation isgreater than anticipated or if t
he other potentially responsible parties are not financially ab le to contribute to thes e costs .   The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that arematerially different than this estimate
 and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations during the period in which they are recorded. 
Nuclear
Insurance
 
The Utility is a member o
f NEIL, which is a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities.  NEIL provides insurance coverage for p roperty damages andbusiness interruption losses in
curred by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nucle ar generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired Humboldt BayUnit 3. 
NEIL provides property damage and bus iness interruption coverage of up to $ 3.5 billion per nuclear incident and $ 2.8 billion per non-nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon 
.  Humboldt Bay Unit 3 has up to $ 131 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.  If NEIL losses in any policy year exc eed accumulated funds,the Utility could be subjec
t to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment, as of December 31 , 201 5 , the current maximum aggregate annualretrospective prem
ium obligation for the Utility is approximately $ 60 million. 
NEIL also provide 
s coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants.  Certain acts of terro rism may be “certified” by the Secretary of theTreasury.  If damages ar
e caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL can obtain compensation from the federal government and will provide up to its full policy limit of $3. 5 billion for each insured 
loss.  In contrast, NEIL would treat all non-certified terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month period against one or more commercial nuclear powerplants insured by NEIL as one event and 
the owners of the affected plants would share the $3. 5 billion policy limit amount.  
Under the Price-Anderson Act, public 
liability claims that arise from nuclear incid ents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation of materialto and from Diablo Canyon are li
mited to $13. 5 billion.  The Utility purchased the maximum available public liability insurance of $375 million for Diablo Canyon.  The balance of the $13. 
5 billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors.  The Utility may be assessed up to $255million per nuclear 
incident under this program, with payments in each year limited to a m aximum of $38 million per incident.  Both the maximum assessment and themaximum yearly assessm
ent are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.  The next scheduled adjustment is due on or before September 10, 2018 .  
The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to 
claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to a fuelfabricator or that occur at the
 fuel fabricator’s facility.  The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidents up to a maximumof $ 
375 million per incident. In addition, the Utility has $ 53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a $ 500 million indemnification from the NRC forpublic liability ar
ising from nuclear incidents, covering liabilities in excess of the lia bility insurance. 125

  
Resolution
of
Remaining
Chapter
11
Disputed
Claims
 
Various electricity supp
liers filed claims in the Utility’s proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energy supp lied to theUtility’s customers betwe
en May 2000 and June 2001.  These claims, which the Utility disputes, are being addressed in various FERC and judicial proceedings in which the Stateof California, the Utilit
y, and other electricity purchasers are seeking refunds from electricity suppliers, including governmental entities, for overcharges incurred in the CAISOand the 
California Power Exchange wholesale electricity markets during this period .  
At 
December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , the Consolidated Balance Sheets re flected $ 454 million and $434 million, respectively, in net Disputed claims andcustomer refunds, including bo
th principal and interest. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Utility held $ 228 million and $291 million, respectively, in escrow, includingearned interest, for p
ayment of the remaining net disputed claims liability.  These amounts are included within restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Interest accrues on the remaini
ng net disputed claims liability at the FERC-ordered rate, which is h igher than the rate earned by the Utility on the escrow balance. Although the Utility has been col
lecting the difference between the accrued interest and the earned interest from customers in rates , these collections ar e not held in escrow.  Ifthe amount of accrued in
terest is greater than the amount of interest ultimately determined to be owed on the remaining net disputed claims liability , the Utility would refund to customers any excess inte
rest collected.  The amount of any interest that the Utility may be required to pay will depend on the final determined amount of the remaining netdisputed claims 
liability and when such interest is paid.  
While the FERC and judicial proc
eedings are pending, the Utility has pursued, and continues to pursue, se ttlements with electricity suppliers.  The Utility has entered into a number of settlement 
agreement s with various electric ity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and to resolve the Utility’s refund claims against theseelectricity suppliers.  
Under these settlement agreements, a mounts payable by the parti es are, in some instances, subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the variousrefund offset and inter
est issues being considered by the FER C.  Any net refunds, claim offsets, o r other credits that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either throughsettlement or through th
e conclusion of the various FERC and judicial proceedings are refunded to customers through rates in future periods. 
In July 2014, a settlement ag
reement between the Utility and an electric supplier became effective, resolving a portion of the Utility’s net disputed claims and resulting in refunds to customers of $ 
312 million.  No significant settlem ent agreements were reached in 2015.  The Utility is uncertain when and how the remaining net disputed claimsliability 
will be resolved.

 T he Utility has entered into many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, which include tolling agree
ments and resource adequacy agreements .  The Utility’s obligation unde r a portion of these agreements is contingent on the third part ies ’ development ofnew generation facilit 
ies to provide capacity and energy produc ts to the Utility .   As of December 31, 2015, these power purchase agreements expire at various dates between2016 and 
2033 .  
Other
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

The Utility has entered in to agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that own generation facilities 
that meet the defin ition of a QF under federal law.  Several of these agreements are treated as capital lease s.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , net capital leasesreflected in proper
ty, plant, and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $ 54 million and $74 million including accumulated  amortization of $ 147 million and $ 128 millio 
n, respectively.  The presen t value of the future minimum lease payments due under these agreements included $ 19 million and $20 million in Current Liabilities and $ 35 million and $54 million in Noncu
rrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , QF contracts in operation expire at various dates between 
2016 and 2028 .  In addition, t he Utility has agreemen ts with various irrigation districts and water agenci es to purchase hydroelect ric power. 
The costs incurred for 
all power purchase s and electric capa city amounted to $ 3.5 billion in 2015, $3.6 billion in 2014, and $3.0 billion in 2013.

 MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT
 

 ON
INTERNAL
CONTROL
OVER


 FINANCIAL
REPORTING 
Management of PG&E Corporation and Uti
lity is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.     PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting andthe preparation of fin
ancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.     Internal control over financial reportingincludes those policies
 and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of theassets of PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements inaccordance with GAAP and that rece
ipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of PG&E Corporation and theUtility, and (3) provide re
asonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effecton the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent
 limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies orprocedures may deteriorate.
 
Management assessed the
 effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal
Control— Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission.     Based on its assessment and those criteria, managementhas concluded that PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 .

We have audited the int

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Com
mission. The Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reportingand for its assessment of th
e effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management
 ’
 s
Report
on
Internal
Control
Over
FinancialReporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We conducted our audit 
s in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we planand perform the audit 
s to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit s included obtaining an underst
anding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operatingeffectiveness of int
ernal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our auditsprovide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion. 
A company 
’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company ’ s principal executive and principal financialofficers, or persons perfo
rming similar functions, and effected by the company ’ s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporti
ng and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company ’ sinternal control over financial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairlyreflect the trans
actions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statem
ents in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of manag
ement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, ordisposition of the company 
’ s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent l
imitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,material missta
tements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal controlover financial repor
ting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, the Company and the Util
ity maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria established in

We have audited the ac

lity”) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the Company ’ s related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cashflows and the Utility 
’ s related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each o f the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 
2015 . These financial stat ements are the responsibility of the Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on thesefinancial statem
ents based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we planand perform the audit to ob
tain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,evidence supporting the amoun
ts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as ev
aluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such consolidated f
inancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries and of PacificGas and Electric Company and subsidi
aries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their op erations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the periodended December 31,

 of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered tohave voluntarily term
inated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination."Notwithstanding the
 foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration of such leave is notguaranteed
 by statute or contract, then you shall be deemed to have had a "separation from service" for purposes of any Restricted StockUnits
 that are settled hereunder upon such separation.  To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinablephysical
 or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least six (6) months and suchimpairment
 causes  you  to  be  unable  to  perform  the  duties  of  your  position  of  employment  or  any  substantially  similar  position  ofemployment, the six (6) mon
th period in the prior sentence shall be twenty-nine (29) months.PG&E
 Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when youremployment termina
tes for all purposes under this Agreement.Voting

mission to the RMC or PG&E is required. However, you may need to keep receipts for your personal tax records. If indoubt, keep your receipts and t
alk to a tax advisor.The MEA will be distributed dire
ctly to you from the RMC via direct deposit or check once your signed Repayment Agreement has been received and you have started work inyour new location. If you are a 
current employee, you will be responsible for updating your Personnel Change Request in order to receive your MEA.The MEA may be used to help with expenses such 
as:§
Storage or shipment of household goods outside of the parameters outlined in this guide§
Alcohol, wine and wine cellar shipment§

Lease
CancellationIf you are a renter and h
ave a lease to cancel in the departure location, you will be reimbursed for up to 2 months' rent.  Your lease must have been signed prior to the date of theofficial reloca
tion.  The intent of this benefit is to cover lease cancellation fees, but not unused rent (i.e. if you are responsible for rent through a given month and move outmidway through the month, the bal
ance of that month's rent is not considered reimbursable as "lease cancellation").Following is the documentation th
at you will need to submit for reimbursement:§
A copy of the current lease signed by the landlord and tenant(s)§
A copy of the notice to vacate letter that you provided to the landlord or property manager, which includes the date you intend to vacate§
A response back from your landlord with the dollar amount required to break the lease and confirmation that you have vacated and turned in your keys.  The landlordwill need to outline the cos
ts (i.e. rent, break fee, etc.), associated with breaking the lease.§
Proof of payment of the amount you paid to the landlord for the lease break.  This can be in the form of a cancelled check (front and back), credit card or bank statementshowing the charge, or a signed/da
ted receipt from the landlord showing what was paid.Upload all of the above documen
ts to the website at www.altairglobal.com for reimbursement cons ideration.  Please provide all required documents together to avoid delays inreviewing your reimbursem
ent.Relocation
Clause
If you decide to rent ra
ther than purchase a home in the new location, you should include a relocation clause in your new lease that allows you to terminate the lease withoutpenalty upon future reloc
ation. The following example may be used:It is understood the Lessee is sub
ject to transfer by his or her employer. Accordingly, it is agreed in the event of Lessee's transfer at any time priorto the date on which the last 
monthly rental payment under this Lease becomes due, Lessor will release Lessee of and from all further obligationsunder the Lease as of the l
ast day of the monthly rental period during which Lessee vacates the premises, provided the Lessee gives written noticeto the Lessor 30 days prior to vac
ating.

be
at
risk.
Step
1:



 Speak
with
your
RMC
consultant
before
signing
any
agreement(s)
with
real
estate
professionals
regardingthe
sale
of
your
home.
As soon as PG&E authorizes the RMC to provide servi
ces, your consultant will contact you to conduct an initial interview. This interview will include discussion of all aspectsof your relocation benef
its and the needs that you anticipate for your family during the relocation process.Step
2:



 Broker's
Market
AnalysisAfter the initial in
terview, your consultant will order two Broker's Market Analyses of your home and review them with you. A Broker's Market Analysis (BMA) is performedby a real estate broke
r on the basis of his or her knowledge of the current real estate resale activity in the community. Each Analysis will compare your home with other similar,recently sold homes to at
tempt to answer the question:"What will the home sell 
for in the next three to four months, as is, with usual financing for the area?"The average value of the BMAs will b
e the basis for the initial listing price for your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program. The home should be listed for no more than5% over the average of th
e two BMAs' most probable sales price. (Following the appraisal process, you will need to adjust your list price so that it is not more than 5% over thevalue provided in your Guarante
ed Purchase Offer.)  Adherence to the Home Sale Assistance Program requirements, including list price caps, is necessary to receive the homesale assistance and home pu
rchase benefits outlined in this guide.Step
3:



 Selecting
a
broker
or
agent
to
sell
your
homeYou may want to list your home with one of 
the brokers who provided a BMA, but you are not required to do so. Talk over your broker preferences with your RMC consultant.If you wish to consider additiona
l brokers, the RMC will provide referrals. You are free to choose a broker or agent you already know, subject to RMC approval. Approval mustbe granted before you take 
any action regarding the price, terms and service requirements of the listing.  In addition, your agent may not be your relative (defined as a parent,child, spouse, domestic partn
er, sibling, in-law, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, or grandchild) as it is a conflict of interest for the Company to reimburse members of arelocating family 
for services (commission) connected with the sale of the old home or purchase of a new home.Step
4:



 Listing
your
home
for
saleAfter you have chosen a broker or 
agent, you will be asked to sign a listing agreement. The following "Exclusion Clause" must be included as a signed addendum to your listingagreement:
"It is understood and agreed th
at regardless of whether or not an offer is presented by a ready, willing and able buyer:(1)
That no commission or compensa tion is earned by, or is due and payable to, broker until sale of the property has been consummated between seller and buyer,the deed delivered to th
e buyer and the purchase price delivered to the seller; and(2)
That the seller rese rves the right to sell the property to Altair Global or any other person(s) designated by Altair (individually and collectively a "NamedProspective Purchaser") at 
any time upon which this listing agreement shall terminate without obligation by Altair or the parties to this agreement and nocommission or compensation wi
ll be due."The
exclusion
clause
must
be
attached
to
the
listing
agr
eement
as
a
signed
addendum.
This clause will prevent PG&E fro m paying the listing broker double commissionwhen the home is sold.
The
commission
may
not
exceed
6%
without
prior
approval
from
P
G&E.
The
term
of
any
listing
agreement
should
not
exceed
90
days.
Your RMC consultant may recommend a shorter term un
der certain circumstances.Establish
a
realistic
list
pric
e
for
the
home.
Your RMC consultant will offer advic e on the best listing and selling prices, based on current market data provided by real estateprofessionals in the commun
ity. You are encouraged to participate in this process by providing relevant data to the brokers chosen to assess value. The advantages of acompetitive listing p
rice will be explained fully by your consultant.You must complete a home sal
e disclosure statement. Every home seller has certain legal duties and obligations to a buyer, including full disclosure of all pertinent informationabout the condition of the hom
e and its surroundings. If the RMC inadvertently or without proper disclosure information purchases a home ineligible for the Home SaleAssistance program, and PG&E incurs a 
loss as a result of your omission or misrepresentation of information, you must repay PG&E any current and future out-of-pocketexpenses, and/or fines or leg
al judgments paid or to be paid by PG&E with regard to the property.You
must
not
sign
any
purchase
offers
or
accept
any
earnest
money.
Your
reloca
tion
consultant
will
instruct
you
on
how
to
proceed.Step
5:



 Work
closely
with
the
broker
and
the
RMC

to
locate
a
buyer
for
your
home.Your RMC consultant will work directly with 
the real estate broker or agent to monitor progress in marketing your home. The consultant will make constructive suggestions andnote any market activ
ity that might impact the sales strategy. You will be contacted regularly by the consultant to discuss current information and revise the sales strategy asneeded. You are encouraged to c
arefully evaluate these recommendations, but you are not required to accept them.

You should contact your RMC consultant imm
ediately when you receive any offer to purchase your home. Your consultant is available by phone toll-free during office hours orafter hours by calling th
e number listed on his or her business card, and he or she will tell you what to do if the offer is acceptable to you.If an offer from a buye
r is acceptable, the RMC will sign the contracts. The RMC's obligation to you and PG&E is to determine if the buyer is qualified and if the offer is bonafide before approving the 
contract.It
is

to

with
care
in

If the buyer's purchase off er requires the seller to pay anyconcessions or buyer's expenses at

 Amended
Value
SaleAmended Value Sale is a procedur
e that will be used when you find a buyer for your home. The Amended Value Sale Program consists of two separate, arm's lengthtransactions:
§
The RMC purchases the home from you at the same net price and terms as the bona fide offer that you have received from a buyer. Once the sale to the RMC closes and youvacate the home, subjec
t to disclosure obligations, you are no longer financially or legally responsible for the home.§
The RMC, as the owner of the property, sells the home at the previously offered price to the buyer who made the offer. If something should happen to prevent this secondsale from taking plac
e, you are not affected.Because the RMC, on behalf of PG&E, is buying your home b
ased on the value of the offer you have received, the RMC must be sure that the offer is bona fide and that thebuyer is ready, willing and abl
e to purchase your home. Your consultant will work closely with you and your broker as you consider any offers to be sure that the terms areacceptable to the RMC and PG&E.
In order for an offer to b
e eligible for the Amended Value Sale Program, it must meet certain requirements, including:§
The contract of sale from the buyer must specify a closing date that is within 60 days of the contract date.§
The contract must not be contingent on the sale of the purchaser's home. It can, however, be contingent on a closing scheduled to occur within thirty (30) days of the contractdate.
§
The contract must not contain other contingencies, with the exception of inspections and buyer's approval for financing.If the RMC cannot accept the 
contract of sale because the buyer is not qualified with a bona fide offer, you must continue to market the home.  If you choose to accept thecontract of sale with th
e buyer against the recommendation of the RMC, you will be responsible for managing the process as an independent sale, outside of the Home SaleAssistance Program.  In this cas
e, you will still receive direct reimbursement for reasonable and customary home sale expenses; however, none
of
the
expenses
of
the transaction
will
be
grossed
up.
Step
8:



 Closing
an
Amended
Value
SaleWhen an acceptable of
fer to purchase the home has been received, documents previously sent by the RMC will require immediate attention. The documents will include acontract of sale betwe
en you and the RMC, certain financial information forms and a general warranty deed that will subsequently be used by the RMC to convey title. Yourconsultant will offer spe
cific advice as required, but you (and your spouse, if applicable) should plan to execute the documents as soon as possible before a Notary Public andreturn them to your RMC consultant. 
It will not be necessary for you to attend the closing of the sale.
You will receive your equity directly from the RMC when the Contract of Sale documents are signed or the property is vacated, whichever is later. Payment will be by eithercheck or electronic 
transfer. You will also receive a detailed equity statement by email, mail, or fax explaining every adjustment to the equity. In general, the equity will becalculated as follows:
Guide for Calculation of Equity
To determine the tota
l "net" cash value ofany transaction on the home und
er the HomeSale Assistance Program, firs
t add together:1.      The purchase price appearing in the RMC's contract of sale, wherein you are the seller and the RMC is the purchaser.2. 
     Any amounts you have prepaid for which you are entitled to receive a prorated refund, such as interest and taxes, but excludinghome casualty insurance.
Then subtract from the abov
e the total of thefollowing amounts (if any) th
at areapplicable:
1.      All outstanding indebtedness (mortgages, tax liens, judgments, etc.)2. 
     Charges for prorated items such as interest and taxes through the effective date of the contract of sale between you and theRMC or through the vacate date, which
ever is later.3. 
     Concessions to which you agreed as the seller.4. 
     Costs for deferred maintenance/repairs to be completed before the home can be purchased.5. 
     A vacate holdback of $500, refundable to you after you have permanently vacated the property and the RMC has verifiedproperty condition.
The difference is:
The net equity under the Company r elocation program.Step
9:



 Cost
of
OwnershipThe sale price in the Contr
act of Sale between you and the RMC will reflect the cost of ownership of the home (property insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and interest onthe mortgage) 
through
the
effective
da te
of
the
contract
of
sale
between
you
and
the
RMC
or
the
vacate
date,
whichever
is
later.
The equity statement f rom the RMC will providea detailed accounting of 
your home sale transaction.It is acceptable to 
cancel your property insurance as of your vacate or acceptance date, whichever is later. However, for liability purposes it is recommended that your propertyinsurance remain in e
ffect until your new policy is in force .
It
is
your
responsibility
to
contact
your
insurance
ca rrier
to
advise
them
of
cancellation.Your RMC consultant will advise you when to discont
inue making mortgage and other payments. If you have arrangements with any lender for payments to be automaticallydeducted from your account, 
it will be your responsibility to cancel the automatic draft(s) as of your acceptance or vacate date whichever is later. It
is
imperative
you
discuss
with your
RMC
consultant
when
to
send
this
form
to
your
l
ender.
If you fail to cancel you r automatic draft(s), refunds for overpayments will be delayed until after closing.Step
10:



 Vacating
the
HomeIf you vacate prior to c
losing, your real estate broker will make arrangements to pick up your house keys, warranties, garage door opener controls and other such necessities.Your consultant will notify you when to t
ransfer utilities to the broker's name, but do not request the utilities be turned off as this will result in reconnect charges. Please be sureto contact the utili
ty companies to provide your forwarding address for your final bills.Regardless of whether you vacat
e before or after closing, it will be necessary to leave the home in cleanly swept condition. In order to avoid paying additional cleaning chargeslater, the home must be 
clean and you must remove all personal property, trash or debris. Cleaning charges will be withheld from the refund of your "vacate holdback" (Step 8,item 5 in the Guide for Calcu
lation of Equity) if necessary.Tax
Liability
The majority of expenditu
res associated with this benefit are not reported as gross earnings; thus no gross-up is necessary provided the home sells under the Amended Value Saleprogram. The only exception to 
this is the expenditures associated with the deed and transfer tax of the property in some states.Guaranteed
Purchase
Offer
Once your home is listed under th
e Home Sale Assistance Program, the RMC will guarantee to purchase your home at a price based on objective relocation appraisals. With thisGuaranteed Purchase Offer (GPO), it 
is possible for you to move with confidence, knowing you may accept the RMC's offer if further marketing under the Home Sale AssistanceProgram does not bring an accep
table outside buyer.Required
Marketing
Period
You are required to marke
t your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program for 60 days before you may accept the Guaranteed Purchase Offer. The required marketingperiod begins on the day you list your ho

When you have begun to market your ho

l, independent appraisers who, once selected, will be hired by the RMC to appraise your home.The primary intent of PG&E's Home Sal
e Assistance Program is to assist you in locating a buyer, not to purchase and re-sell your home. Therefore, the appraisers are asked toobjectively evaluate your 
home in order to estimate the most
probable
selling
price
after
 reasonable
market
exposure.
This definition of value di ffers from a bank ormortgage appraisal and 
may also differ from what a specific buyer might be willing to pay for your home. The GPO is provided as a fall-back offer, available to you if you do notlocate a buyer. Through the RMC, PG&E will purch
ase your home at a price that should enable the RMC to re-sell it within a reasonable amount of time.You will be thoroughly briefed on the 
content of the appraisals by your relocation consultant.The amount of the Guaranteed Pur
chase Offer will be the average of the two appraisal values. If the lower value of the two appraisals is not within 5% of the higher value, theRMC will ask you to select another app
raiser and will order a third appraisal. When this occurs, the Guaranteed Purchase Offer amount will be the average of the two
closest 
values.
(The Brokers' Market Analyses, discuss ed previously in the "Home Sale Assistance Program" section, will not
 be included in the average.)The appraised value is cont
ingent on the results of any customary and required inspections. Repairs identified through these inspections are your financial responsibility. Repairsmust be completed befor
e equity is released or the cost of repairs will be deducted from your equity. Repairs are subject to re-inspection. Repairs identified will be defects (i.e.,leaks, faulty furnace o
r water heater, etc.) and do not include cosmetic items such as painting or replacing carpet, unless those items are required by a lender.In the process of appraising you
r home, the appraisers will review comparable sales selected from a multiple listing service or similar directory. You are encouraged to provideappraisers with a list of 
recent, comparable sales or other related data that may be useful in assessing the value of your home.Within seven days of rece
iving your Guaranteed Purchase Offer, you must reduce your list price to no more than 105% of the GPO amount.  Adherence to the Home SaleAssistance Program guidelines, 
including list price caps, is necessary to receive the home sale and home purchase benefits outlined in this guide.Accepting
the
Guaranteed
Purchase
Offer
You may accept the GPO at the end of th
e 60-day marketing period, or you may continue to market the home until the end of the acceptance period of the GPO. The acceptanceperiod of the GPO is 60 days, beginning with the da
te of the offer (not necessarily the same date as the marketing period begins).To accept the GPO, execute the con
tracts and all associated documents (which may differ depending on which state the home is located). Several of the documents will requirethe acknowledgment of a Notary Publ
ic. All documents must be in the RMC's possession before the end of the 60th day.The equity payments based on the GPO will be 
made on the later of either the contract date (when the contract is signed by your relocation consultant) or the date the home isvacated. Allow five (5) business d
ays after the RMC receives paperwork for payment of the equity. The RMC will deliver the equity check to you by overnight service or wirethe funds directly to the 
account.Amended
Value
Sale
If, before accepting you
r GPO, you receive an offer from an outside buyer that you wish to consider, work with your broker and your RMC consultant to negotiate the offer sothat it may be closed as 
an Amended Value Sale. (See previous discussion of this procedure in the "Home Sale Assistance Program.")
Home
Sale
IncentiveShould you receive an offer f
rom an outside buyer that is less than the GPO amount, terms may be negotiated for an amended value sales price that is no less than 95% of theGPO amount. In this case, you may accep
t this offer and still receive the full amount of the GPO.  You will also receive a bonus of 1% of the negotiated sales price, up to amaximum of $10,000, less applic
able taxes.Possession
Period
You will be given thirty (30) days f
rom acceptance of the GPO or Amended Value Sale to vacate the property.Proration

If you accept the GPO, you will be responsib
le for insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance, principal and interest on the mortgage through

property

of
Gain
or
Loss
on
Sale
to
Employee
Under the terms dictat
ed by the Internal Revenue Service, if the employee accepts the GPO and the property ultimately sells for more than the employee's GPO buyout, a pass-back of a gain (or a loss) is no
t permitted. The sales are treated as two separate sales transactions and cannot be related.Tax
Liability
The majority of expenditu
res associated with the GPO benefit are not reported as gross earnings; thus no gross-up is necessary provided the home sells under the GuaranteedPurchase Offer program. The only 
exception to this is the expenditures associated with the deed and transfer tax of the property in some states.However, the Home Sale Incentive 
is reported as additional gross earnings. No tax assistance is available and appropriate taxes will be withheld.Equity
Advance
The Company may grant you an equity adv
ance in the form of a loan for up to 90% of the equity in your current home when the equity is required to guarantee a contract on ahome in the new location. The adv
ance is made to accommodate your being transferred at the request of the Company, and it is not a mortgage loan. The following guidelinesapply:
§
The advance will equal no more than 90% of the equity based on the Guaranteed Purchase Offer.§
The total amount of the advance must be used exclusively toward the purchase of a new residence.§
You must sign a promissory note and agree to repay the advance upon completion of the sale of the former residence. The term of the promissory note is 120 days.If
