PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Founded in 1982, Adobe Inc. is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of
products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, students, application developers, enterprises
and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and
experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers
through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at
www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both
of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute
certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“V ARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”),
independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In
addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products
and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices,
depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia-Pacific
(“APAC”).
Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our
executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number
is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com. Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from this site free of charge,
as well as from the SEC website at www.sec.gov. The information posted to our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
For over 35 years, Adobe’s innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments engage and
interact with their constituents in print and online. We help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in
a streamlined workflow and optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions
into valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anytime, anywhere.
While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic
growth areas:
Digital Media – providing products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish
and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include creative professionals like photographers, video editors, graphic and
experience designers, and application and game developers; communicators like content creators, students, marketers and
knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content; and consumers. This is the core of
what we have delivered for decades, and we have evolved our business model to provide our customers with a range of flexible
solutions that allow them to reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device on projects of all types.
Digital Experience – providing a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe
Experience Cloud that enables businesses and brands to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer
experiences that span from advertising to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers,
merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers, marketing executives, information management and
technology executives, product development executives and sales and support executives. Underpinning Adobe Experience Cloud
is our Adobe Experience Platform, which provides businesses and brands with an open and extensible platform for customer
experience management with real-time customer profiles that enable deep customer insights and the delivery of personalized
digital experiences in milliseconds. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital
Experience offerings, we help our customers more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content
across channels and devices with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience markets, where our
mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are
able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to
deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery,
measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering
digital experiences.Table of Contents
4SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. These segments
provide Adobe’s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around
our two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our Publishing business in a third segment that contains some of
our mature products and solutions.
MARKET OVERVIEW
This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2020 and beyond
for each of our segments. See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 of Part II, Item 8 titled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
for further segment information.
Digital Media
Digital Media Opportunity
Recent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in
digital media. Everyone has a story to tell — from creative professionals, to students and knowledge workers, to immersive content
and experience designers — and they need to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvasses. In today’s world where
the velocity of creation and consumption of digital content is constantly growing, design and creativity have never been more
relevant and customers are looking for a way to meet demand with engaging online experiences. Adobe is in a strong position to
capitalize on this opportunity with innovation that will accelerate the creative process across all platforms and devices, deepen
engagement with communities and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed
on a subscription basis.
The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud — a subscription service that allows members to use
Adobe’s creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices. Creative Cloud
members can download and access the latest versions of our creative products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro,
Lightroom, InDesign, Adobe XD and many more creative applications. To expand our reach and improve the way we serve the
needs of our customers, we create different combinations of these services, including our applications with free and paid tiers such
as Adobe Lightroom Mobile that have brought new customers into our franchise and increased our footprint on mobile devices.
In addition, members can access built-in templates and presets created by the Adobe user community to jumpstart designs and
step-by-step interactive tutorials to sharpen their skills and get up to speed quickly. Through Creative Cloud, members can access
online services to sync, store and share files across users’ devices, access marketplace, social and community-based features within
our Adobe Stock and Behance services, and create apps and websites, all at affordable subscription pricing.
Adobe continues to redefine the creative process with Adobe Creative Cloud so that our customers can obtain everything
they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. One part of our strategy is Adobe Sensei, a proprietary framework and set of
intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages Adobe’s
massive content and data assets, as well as its deep domain expertise in the creative, marketing and document segments, within a
unified artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning framework to help customers discover hidden opportunities, reduce
tedious processes and offer relevant experiences to every customer.
Adobe Creative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals such as artists, designers, developers, students and
administrators, as well as knowledge workers, marketers, educators, hobbyists and consumers, who also use our products to create
and deliver content. Our customers rely on our products for content creation, design, video and animation production, mobile app
and gaming development and document creation and collaboration. End users of our creative products work in businesses of all
sizes ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies and individual freelancers.
Moreover, our creative products are used to create much of the printed and online information people see, read and interact with
every day, including video, animation, mobile and advertising content. We have introduced new products, features and services
to address emerging categories of content creation across devices and platforms, such as voice-based prototyping, refined content
creation tools, 3D, augmented reality, virtual reality and user experience design. New projects announced and solutions offered
include: Substance, a suite of applications for creating, mixing and applying textures and materials for 3D creations; Adobe Fresco,
a mobile drawing and painting application, featuring live brushes that mimic natural media like oil paint and watercolors in
amazingly lifelike ways; Adobe Aero, a free iOS application for viewing, building and sharing immersive and interactive augmented
reality experiences; Photoshop Camera, an AI-driven mobile camera application launching in 2020 powered by Adobe Sensei
featuring unique Photoshop lenses and camera effects right inside the camera; and both Illustrator on iPad, which will be available
in 2020, and Photoshop on iPad to enable a seamless content creation experience across devices and attract a new, mobile-centric
audience.
Adobe’s Digital Media segment includes our Adobe Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of products,
including Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader, and a set of integrated, cloud-based document services, including Adobe
Sign and Adobe Scan. Tens of millions of knowledge workers worldwide interact with documents daily. Across industries and
across the world, business processes from contracting to invoicing to employee onboarding are making the change from paper to
electronic documents. Cloud services and mobile devices are reshaping how we work in ways that are more ad hoc, collaborative,
unstructured and on the go. For over 25 years, Acrobat has provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents,
regardless of platform or application source type. Users can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the
security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing our free
Acrobat Reader on any device. Acrobat provides essential electronic document capabilities and services across desktop, mobile
devices and the web to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide variety of tasks ranging from simple publications and forms
to mission-critical engineering documentation and architectural plans. With our Acrobat product and its innovative cloud services,
we have extended the capabilities of our document solutions, from view and create, to edit, secure, scan, review, embed, share and
sign. Users can create a PDF with just the camera on their phone with Adobe Scan, edit PDFs on the go with Acrobat on iOS and
Android, and turn slow, manual signing processes into automated experiences and collect signatures with Adobe Sign.  
Digital Media Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading platform for creativity where we offer a range of products and services that allow individuals,
teams and enterprises, and both professionals and enthusiasts, to design and deliver amazing digital content.
We believe there is significant opportunity for growth across all customer segments and expect Adobe Creative Cloud will
drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by using our products to enable
everyone to create and tell their stories, expanding into new categories and technologies like immersive 3D and augmented reality,
making the creative process more productive with cloud-enabled collaboration and workflows, delivering intelligent, time-saving
features with Adobe Sensei’s artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, and acquiring new users by engaging with
the creative community. 
We will continue to deepen our relationship with existing users through meeting their needs holistically and delivering
additional features and increased value, including through data-driven customer engagement, AI and machine learning through
Adobe Sensei, and offering a true “multi-surface platform” that provides our customers with the ability to use our tools for creation
wherever inspiration strikes, by enabling them to seamlessly access their assets in the cloud and work across mobile, tablet and
desktop with new applications like Adobe Fresco and Photoshop for iPad. We are embracing new frontiers in technology and
creativity such as immersive 3D and augmented reality (“AR”) experiences with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products.
We are pursuing new ways to help our customers develop creative skills such as allowing creators to live-stream their creative
process on Behance and allowing users to learn with step-by-step, in-app, interactive tutorials from experienced creators. 
As appropriate, we plan to optimize our pricing strategy and move our customers to higher priced and better value offerings
and continue to employ targeted promotions that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to
Adobe Creative Cloud. To target new customers and better address the needs of our existing customers, we will continue to invest
in driving innovation to maintain the leadership position that we have established. We offer a marketplace for Creative Cloud
subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative
Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers and grow a recurring and predictable
revenue stream that is recognized ratably.Table of Contents

As part of our Adobe Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a data-driven operating model and our Adobe Experience Cloud
solutions to drive and optimize customer awareness, engagement and licensing of our creative products and services at every stop
of the customer journey through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming the destination site
where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. We offer free
apps and trials to attract new customers and through a data-driven model, we optimize conversion of these trialists to paid subscribers.
We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force
is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.
We offer many of the products included in Adobe Creative Cloud on a standalone basis, including subscriptions to the
Creative Cloud version of certain point products. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including our hobbyist
products such as Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements, Adobe Fonts and mobile apps such as Photoshop Express, Photoshop
Sketch, Adobe Capture, Premiere Rush and Adobe Spark. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below
under “Principal Products and Services.”
In our Adobe Document Cloud business, Adobe Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption and a leadership position in
document-intensive industries such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical
publishing. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year and we believe there remain hundreds of millions of users in
industries that engage with PDF files on a daily basis like legal, financial services or publishing, as well as a broader array of
communicators, knowledge workers and Acrobat Reader users, who need the capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications
and the document services platform found in Document Cloud. We expect to drive sustained long-term revenue growth in Adobe
Document Cloud through a continued expansion of our customer base by delivering the best PDF experience on every platform
and across platforms, expanding the number of actions and features in Acrobat, using Adobe Sensei to make both new and legacy
documents more intelligent and responsive, and investing in embedded document services such as integrating Adobe Sign in third-
party applications.  As with our Adobe Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a data-driven operating model to market our Document
Cloud solutions to and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses,
large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our seat penetration in our key markets through
the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing
Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on
expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business,
including our partnership with Microsoft. 
Our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across desktop, web and mobile
devices. Acrobat on mobile devices can be used to create, edit, export, combine, collaborate on and share PDFs on the go and the
Adobe Scan app for mobile devices can be used to capture paper documents as images and transform them into full-featured PDFs
via Document Cloud services that can be shared immediately, essentially putting scanning capabilities in the pocket of every
person. We are delivering PDF document services on the web, such as allowing users to create, convert and compress PDFs on
Adobe.com. Our Adobe Sign service also provides a green alternative to costly paper-based solutions, and is a more modern and
convenient way for customers to digitally manage their documents, processes and contract workflows. We believe that by growing
the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance
customer experiences through machine learning and AI, and continuing to add new capabilities to our Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign
offerings, we can help our customers migrate away from paper-based express mailing and adopt our solution to modernize and
digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process. 
Digital Experience
Digital Experience Opportunity
Digital transformation is a macro trend that affects every business, government and educational institution today - making
every business a digital business. Consumers today buy experiences, not just products, and they demand compelling experiences
in their digital interactions that are seamless across channels and devices. Enterprises and brands recognize that customers have
more choices and lower switching costs than ever before. In this new hyper-connected digital environment, it is the customer
experience that differentiates brands and ultimately determines customer loyalty. As a result, businesses must determine how to
best attract, engage, acquire and retain customers in a digital world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impact
success. Business customers are consumers too, and they increasingly have the same expectations, which are driving business-to-
business (“B2B”) companies to deliver business-to-consumer (“B2C”) experiences with a “business-to-everyone” (“B2E”) strategy.
Delivering the best experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across
multiple channels in real time. To deliver these multi-channel experiences that are personalized to every customer, executives are
increasingly demanding solutions that optimize their consumers’ experiences in real time and deliver the greatest return on marketing
and IT spend so they can demonstrate the business impact of their programs using objective metrics. Table of Contents
6
For the past decade, Adobe Experience Cloud has helped businesses provide exceptional experiences to their customers via
a comprehensive suite of solutions. We believe there is now a significant opportunity to address these challenges of customer
experience management and help our customers transform their businesses into “Experience Businesses.” The world’s leading
brands are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising and development budgets toward digital experiences. As enterprises
make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as brands seek vendors to help them navigate this transition. Enterprises
have a mandate to deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers across digital channels and in areas such as sales, support
and product interactions where consumers expect experiences to be consistent and personalized.
Our Adobe Experience Cloud business targets this large and growing opportunity to help companies deliver the most
engaging customer experiences by providing an integrated, comprehensive set of solutions for customer experience management.
Together, our applications, services and platforms provide real-time data and insights, deliver content and personalization, enable
customer journey management and provide platforms for commerce and advertising management. Our solutions address analytics,
targeting, advertising optimization, digital experience management, marketing automation and engagement, cross-channel
campaign management, content management, creative asset management, audience management, digital commerce enablement,
order management, predictive intelligence and monetization. Collectively, these comprehensive solutions enable marketers to
measure, personalize and optimize digital experiences across all channels and touch points to drive stronger business performance
throughout the customer journey.
We believe the market for Adobe Experience Cloud is large and rapidly growing as more businesses and enterprises invest
in solutions that aid their goals to transform how they engage with their customers and constituents digitally.
Digital Experience Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of cloud-based solutions for delivering digital experiences and enabling digital
transformation. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys,
enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive
advantage is strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to connect our comprehensive set of solutions.
Adobe Experience Cloud delivers the following sets of solutions for our customers:
•Data and insights . Our solutions deliver real-time customer profiles and intelligence across the customer journey.
Adobe Analytics provides an experience system of intelligence for real-time cross-channel data, insights and activations
across every channel. Adobe Audience Manager, our data management platform, helps digital publishers build unique
audience profiles to identify the most valuable segments and use them across any digital channel. Adobe Experience
Platform ingests, processes and stitches data across sources, channels and customer interactions in real time to create
unified customer profiles. Adobe’s Real-time Customer Data Platform service, built on Adobe Experience Platform,
enables brands to bring together known and unknown customer data, to activate customer profiles across channels and
leverage intelligent decision-making throughout the customer journey. Our Customer Journey Analytics service brings
a powerful set of analytics tools to omnichannel data in Adobe Experience Platform, providing brands viewing data
across channels an easy, interactive way to dig deeper and uncover new insights, while making analytics more accessible
across their organization.
•Content and commerce . We offer solutions to help customers manage, deliver, test, target and optimize content delivery
and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses. Our leading digital experience
management solution, Adobe Experience Manager, helps customers organize, create, manage and deliver creative assets
and other content across digital marketing channels, including web, mobile, email, communities and video, enabling
customers to improve their market and brand perception and provide a personalized experience to their consumers.
Adobe Target is a personalization engine that lets our customers test, target and optimize content using machine learning
across multiple apps and the web. Magento Commerce, which integrates with Adobe Experience Manager, enables our
customers to create content and promotions for storefronts on every platform and provides a highly customizable and
scalable end-to-end platform to manage, personalize and optimize the commerce experience across every touchpoint
by bringing together digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence to enable engaging shopping
experiences. 
•Customer journey management . Our solutions help businesses manage, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and
customer journeys across B2E use cases. Adobe Campaign enables marketers to manage the B2C customer journey
and use rich customer data to create, coordinate and deliver dynamic, personalized experiences that are synchronized
across multiple channels and determined by each consumer’s behaviors and preferences. Marketo Engage is a complete
customer experience management solution optimized for B2B, cross-channel campaigns requiring lead management,
account-based marketing and revenue attribution technology by bringing together planning, engagement and
measurement capabilities into an integrated marketing platform. Our Journey Orchestration service, built on AdobeTable of Contents

Experience Platform, enables businesses to design, orchestrate and measure event-driven, customer-led journeys across
the entire customer lifecycle at the individual level to intelligently anticipate every individual’s needs across their
personal journey. 
•Advertising. Adobe Advertising Cloud delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV
and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens.
Adobe Sensei enables machine learning and predictive intelligence and helps automate digital media buying to
traditional TV advertising as well as ad creation. Adobe Advertising Cloud integrates with Adobe Creative Cloud
products and combines capabilities from the Adobe Advertising Cloud Demand-Side Platform, Adobe Advertising
Cloud Search, Adobe Advertising Cloud TV and Adobe Advertising Cloud Creative offerings.
We believe the AI and machine learning framework enabled by our strategy with Adobe Sensei enhances the delivery of
digital experiences.  Adobe Experience Cloud offers domain-specific AI services powered by Adobe Sensei that work with Adobe
Experience Platform to augment existing Experience Cloud product offerings. These AI services help provide domain-specific
intelligence in areas such as attribution and automated insights, customer journey management, lead management, sentiment
analysis, one-click personalization, enhanced anomaly detection and more. By building on existing features and these AI-powered
services, we believe Adobe Sensei will increase the value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in
the market.
Adobe Experience Cloud also offers an open platform and ecosystem through its multi-cloud foundation, the Adobe
Experience Platform, AI services powered by Adobe Sensei, and developer services through Adobe I/O. Adobe Experience Platform
standardizes data into an easily sharable format consumable by Adobe Sensei and provides an open and extensible cloud
infrastructure for Adobe Experience Cloud that allows data to flow freely within the Adobe Experience Platform and between
Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and third-party software. This open architecture offers scalability with a wide variety of
supporting products and services, empowers users to quickly develop innovative applications to interact with consumers, and
enables a broad industry ecosystem through our Open Data Initiative, an open alliance among Adobe, Microsoft, SAP and others.
To drive growth of Adobe Experience Cloud, we are focused on delivering the best customer experience management
solutions for B2E, enterprise and mid-market through our applications, services and platform. We also intend to focus on customer
engagement, growing within existing customer accounts, and product differentiation. We are expanding our customers to include
Chief Information Officers and continuing to invest in Adobe Experience Platform integrations with Adobe Analytics and Adobe
Audience Manager, as well as new services such as Customer Journey Analytics and our Real-time Customer Data Platform, to
create a truly comprehensive customer data and insights offering. To give our customers increased flexibility and expand our reach,
we are also delivering new functionality through additional services delivered on the Adobe Experience Platform such as Journey
Orchestration. We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem
of partners, including marketing agencies, SIs and ISVs that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. Strategic
partnerships, such as the one we have formed with Microsoft, continue to increase our market reach. We have made significant
investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market and believe these investments will result in continued
growth in revenue in our Digital Experience segment in fiscal 2020 and beyond.
Publishing
Our Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning
solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development and
high-end printing. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to require quality, reliability and efficiency in
production printing, and our Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the
sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite
workflows, we believe we are well positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the Adobe PostScript and
Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry.
We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output
devices. In fiscal 2019, we maintained a relatively consistent annual revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and
license in our Publishing business.Table of Contents

COMPETITION
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving
distribution models, disruptive technology developments, frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting
with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. Our future success will depend
on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective basis,
meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks,
extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods
and other technological changes.
Digital Media
No single company has offerings that match the capabilities of our Adobe Creative Cloud products and services, but we
face collective competition from a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. Our competition includes
offerings from companies such as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Corel, Microsoft, Affinity and others, as well as from many lower-end
offerings. We believe our greatest advantage in this space is the performance and scope of our integrated solutions, which work
together as part of Creative Cloud. With Creative Cloud, we compete favorably on the basis of features and functionality, ease of
use, product reliability, value and performance characteristics.
Professional digital imaging, drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand
awareness and price sensitivity. Competition in this space is also emerging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet
and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly
evolving and highly volatile. In this area, we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various
proprietary and open source web-authoring tools.
We face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings by bundling,
for free, their own digital imaging software or those of our competitors. Similarly, we face potential competition from operating
system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating
systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their
devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social networking platforms
such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as Google and Bing
are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share digital media, bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software.
Online storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers will be encouraged to use the image and video
editing software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.
In addition, the needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology
and hardware advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other
new devices. Our imaging and video offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects, Premiere Pro and Premiere Rush,
face competition from established and emerging companies offering similar products.
New image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional tools are
also emerging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to intense
competition, including customer price sensitivity and competitor brand awareness. We face direct and indirect competition in the
consumer digital imaging space from a number of companies whose market software competes with our offerings.
Applications and tools for experience and interface design and prototyping are still emerging and evolving as adoption of
these tools by designers, design teams and larger organizations grows. Competitors to Adobe XD include Figma, Invision and
Sketch. Partnerships and integrations between these companies and third parties create an increasingly competitive landscape in
this space.  
The universe of applications for 3D texturing and material authoring as well as other applications and tools in the areas of
3D, augmented reality and immersive design are still developing and advancing as adoption grows and new use cases emerge.
Adobe’s Substance suite of applications and Adobe Aero face competition from both hardware and software players in these
nascent fields and competitors include Autodesk, Foundry, Quixel and Unity. 
The stock content marketplace has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily
operates today with our Adobe Stock offering. Key competitors in this segment include Shutterstock, Getty Images and a number
of smaller companies. Deep product integration with Adobe Creative Cloud and superior reach and relationships with creative
professionals around the world differentiate our Adobe Stock offerings.Table of Contents

The nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, collaboration and signing has been rapidly evolving as
knowledge workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google,
Box, Dropbox and DocuSign all offer competitive alternatives to our Adobe Document Cloud business for creating and managing
PDFs and e-signatures. In addition, other PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web or via mobile
applications. To address these competitive threats, we are working to ensure our Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront
of innovation in emerging opportunities such as PDF document generation, document collaboration and document security,
document workflow management, easeful software integrations, enablement of paper to digital transformations, and accessibility
and usability on multiple devices, including mobile and desktop.
Digital Experience
The markets in which our Digital Experience business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense
competition. Our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, Oracle,
salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Shopify, Sitecore and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors.
Additionally, new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to
customers, generally through a web browser, while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers.
In addition, we compete at times with our customers’ or potential customers’ internally developed applications. Of the competitors
listed above, no single company has products identical in breadth and depth to our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings. Adobe
Experience Cloud competes in a variety of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization;
online marketing; audience management; advertising and real-time bidding technology; marketing automation; customer data
platforms; digital commerce enablement; order management; web experience management; customer experience management
and others.
Large software, internet and database management companies have expanded their offerings in the digital experience area,
either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic partners of ours. We believe competitive
factors in our markets include the proven performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic
relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable
cost-effective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands; enterprise-level
customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time data and reporting; independence
from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in educating customers in how to utilize
services effectively. We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-cost alternatives based on many of these
competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our focus on global, multi-brand companies, our
superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, standards-based architecture, scalability and
performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.
Creative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital experience technology
to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come to market
with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital experience capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete
technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked
closely with marketing and creative customers for over 30 years. We also believe we have leadership in this space, with current
customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in
serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization,
digital experience management, marketing automation, cross-channel campaign management, digital commerce, audience
management and customer intelligence in our Adobe Experience Cloud. Most importantly, we provide a vision for our Digital
Experience customers as we engage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending from their use of Adobe
Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud to how they manage, deliver, measure and monetize their content, participate in digital
commerce, and create highly personalized and engaging shoppable experiences with our Experience Cloud.
Publishing
Our Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies,
as well as lower-end desktop publishing products. Similarly, our web conferencing product faces competition from a number of
established products from other companies, including Cisco, Citrix and Microsoft. Competition involves a number of factors,
including: product features, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of customization and integration with other publishing
system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete
based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among users, the widespread adoption of our products among
printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming interfaces.Table of Contents
10
In printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language
or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability, price, support and engineering development
assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency, OEM customer relationships and our
intellectual property portfolio.Table of Contents

17OPERATIONS
Marketing and Sales
We market and license our products directly using our sales force and certain local offices and through our own website at
www.adobe.com. We also market and distribute our products through sales channels, which include distributors, retailers, software
developers, SIs, ISVs and V ARs, as well as through OEM and hardware bundle customers.
Our local field offices include locations in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong
Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South
Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
We sell the majority of our products through a software subscription model where our customers purchase access to a
product for a specific period of time during which they always have rights to use the most recent version of that product. We also
license perpetual versions of our software with maintenance and support, which includes rights to upgrades, when and if available,
support, updates and enhancements.
For fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , there were no customers that represented at least 10% of net revenue. As of fiscal year end
2019  and 2018 , no single customer was responsible for over 10% of our trade receivables.
Services and Support
We provide expert consulting, customer success management, technical support and learning services across all our customer
segments, including enterprises, small and medium businesses, creative professionals and consumers. With a focus on ensuring
sustained customer success and realized value, this comprehensive portfolio of services is designed to help customers and partners
maximize the return on their investments in our cloud solutions and licensed products. Our service and support revenue consists
primarily of consulting fees, software maintenance, technical support fees and training fees.
Consulting Services
We have a global professional services team dedicated to designing and implementing solutions for our largest customers.
Our professional services team uses a comprehensive, customer-focused methodology that has been refined over years of capturing
and analyzing best practices from numerous customer engagements across a diverse mix of solutions, industries and customer
segments. Increasingly, our customers seek to integrate across Adobe’s products and cloud solutions, and engage our professional
services teams to share their expertise in leading customers’ digital strategies, multi-solution integrations and in running customer
platforms. Using our methodology, our professional services teams are able to accelerate customers’ time to value, and maximize
the return customers earn on their investment in Adobe solutions.
A key component of Adobe’s strategy is developing a large partner ecosystem to expand the reach and breadth of Adobe
solutions in the global marketplace. In order to assist partners in building their respective digital practices, Adobe Global Services
provides a comprehensive set of deliverables through Adobe’s Solution Partner Program. The breadth of services described in the
program provides system integrators, agencies and regional partners the tools required to develop core capabilities for positioning
and building with Adobe technology, as well as implementing and running customer platforms. We believe that through these
programmatic services and support, our joint customers benefit greatly from the combination of Adobe technology and the deep
customer context that our global partners represent.
Customer Success Account Management
Adobe Customer Solutions provides Customer Success Managers, who work with enterprise and commercial customers
on an ongoing basis to understand their current and future business needs, promote faster solution adoption, and align product
capabilities to customers’ business objectives to maximize the return on their investment in Adobe’s offerings. We engage customers
to share innovative best practices, relevant industry and vertical knowledge, and proven success strategies based on our extensive
engagements with leading marketers and brands. The performance of these teams is directly associated with customer-focused
outcomes.
Technical Support
Adobe provides enterprise maintenance and support services to customers of subscription products as part of the subscription
entitlement, and to perpetual license customers via annual fee-based maintenance and support programs. These offerings provide:
•technical support on the products they have purchased from Adobe; 
•“how to” help in using our products; and
•product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support or subscription period, which is
typically one to three years.
We provide product support through a global support organization that includes several regional and global support centers,
supplemented with outsourced vendors for specific services. Customers can seek help through multiple channels including phone,
chat, web, social media and email, allowing quick and easy access to the information they need. These teams are responsible for
providing timely, high-quality technical expertise on all our products.
Certain consumers are eligible to receive Getting Started support, to assist with easy adoption of their products. Support
for some products and in some countries may vary. For enterprise customers with greater support needs, we offer personalized
service options through Premium Services options, delivered by global support centers and technical account managers who can
also provide proactive risk mitigation services and on-site support services for those with business-critical deployments.
Lastly, we also offer delivery assurance, technical support and enablement services to partners and developer organizations.
Through the Adobe Partner Connection Reseller Program, we provide developers with high-quality tools, software development
kits, information and services.
Digital Learning Services
Adobe Customer Solutions offers a comprehensive portfolio of learning and enablement services to assist our customer
and partner teams in the use of our products, including those within Digital Experience, Digital Media and other legacy products
and solutions. Our training portfolio includes a large number of free online self-service learning options on

strategy, we have introduced a new learning subscription service that enables customers to access both business and technical
Digital Experience training over a 12-month period, which is a scalable approach to supporting long-term learning.
Investments
From time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent
of securing financial returns as well as for strategic purposes, as they often increase our knowledge of emerging markets and
technologies and expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services.Table of Contents

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
A continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of new
solutions due to the speed of technological change that characterizes the software industry. We develop our software internally,
as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns
the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed
by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based
on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.Table of Contents
19PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign
intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have United States and foreign patents and
pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single
patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and
international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.
Our enterprise customers license our hosted offerings as SaaS or Managed Services, and consumers primarily use our
desktop software and mobile apps. We license our desktop software to users under ‘click through’ or signed license agreements
containing restrictions on duplication, disclosure and transfer. Similarly, cloud products and services are provided to users under
‘click through’ or signed agreements containing restrictions on access and use.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may
attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing
unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use
software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and
may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.
EMPLOYEES

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss
some of the factors that could cause these differences. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect
our operations, performance and financial condition.
Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving
distribution models, limited barriers to entry, disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price
sensitivity and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of
charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal
and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our continued
ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-
effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate
emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Furthermore, some of
our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and
other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current
customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. In addition, consolidation
has occurred among some of our competitors. Further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive
pressures and may harm our results of operations.
For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we
operate, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Part I. Item 1 of this report.
If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products
and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
The process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex,
costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological
trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain
appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect
customer demand for our products and services. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may
not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. Additionally, any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or
launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract
new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. 
We offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. Consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet
and mobile devices. If we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices, or if our competitors can adapt their
products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more
difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or
operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.
Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.
The expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. Our future success depends on a variety of
factors, including our continued ability to innovate, introduce new products and services efficiently, enhance and integrate our
products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate
emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Integration of our products
and services with one another and other companies’ offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on
third parties. If any disruptive technology, or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our
solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed. 
The introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products
rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements.
We use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, gauge the performance of their advertisements and detect
and prevent fraudulent activity. Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or “ad-blocking” software or
applications. The most common Internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being
accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. Increased use of methods, software or applications
that block cookies could harm our business.Table of Contents
22
Security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalf, may compromise the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation
and business.
We process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, a large volume of which is hosted by third-party
service providers. A security incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service providers may compromise
the confidentiality, integrity or availability of this data. Unauthorized access to or loss or disclosure of data stored by Adobe or
our service providers may occur through physical break-ins, breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party, software
vulnerabilities or coding errors, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to or
disclosure of employee or customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers or employees.
Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to employee or customer data.
Additionally, failure by Adobe or our customers to remove the accounts of their own employees, or the granting of accounts in an
uncontrolled manner, may allow for access by former or unauthorized individuals. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of
customer data, or unauthorized access to the data we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our
reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations, or fines. In addition,
such perceived or actual unauthorized loss or disclosure of the information we collect, process, or store or breach of our security
could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.
We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, as well as access, collect,
process, use, transmit and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or
transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.
Much of our business relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed and controlled directly by Adobe or third-
party service providers, including our online store at adobe.com, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud solutions.
We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our
disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting
or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with
us, without adequate notice, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could
subject us to reputational harm, costly and time-intensive notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future
business. Occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments. If a transition among data
centers or to third-party service providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity, or unplanned disruptions
despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services to customers and result
in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm our operating results and our business.
It is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers)
could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies
that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with regulatory notification
requirements. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including
access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic
on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses, worms, or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and
the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation, and costly and
time-intensive notification requirements. 
We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a
number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software, or the
failure of our third-party service providers’ network or software. If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand
it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our
data centers or those of third parties, service outages could occur, and our customers could suffer impaired performance of our
services. Such a strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject us to regulatory and customer notification requirements,
violations of service level agreement commitments, financial liabilities, result in customer dissatisfaction, or harm our business.
If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real
time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers as a result, or we could be found liable for damages
or incur other losses.  
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose
us to increased liability.
As a global company, Adobe is subject to global data privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply
to our various business units. These laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and
differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government officials and regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneysTable of Contents
23
are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny
may result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting Adobe’s business. Globally, new and emerging laws,
such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the Network and Information Systems Directive (“NISD”) in
Europe, state laws in the U.S. on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as
industry self-regulatory codes create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or
severally with our customers and suppliers. While we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirements, these
new and emerging laws, regulations and codes may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers’ ability) to reach current and
prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of
access, correction and deletion of their personal information), and to implement our business models effectively. These new laws
may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence
and machine learning). These requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden
of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Any perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual
privacy rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators,
industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Additionally,
we collect and store information on behalf of our business customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations
or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.
Transferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. For example, European
data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely
upon for European data transfers (e.g., Privacy Shield and Model Clauses) are being contested in the European court system. We
are closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data outside the European Union and other
countries that have similar trans-border data flow requirements. These requirements may result in an increase in the obligations
required to provide our services in the European Union or in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other countries,
including Australia and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information.
Other countries, such as India, are considering requirements for data localization (e.g., where personal data must remain in the
country). If the mechanisms for transferring personal information from certain countries or areas, including Europe to the United
States, should be found invalid or if other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers (or not
permit data to leave the country of origin), such developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems, or in our supply chain, could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.
Maintaining the security of our products and services is a critical issue for us and our customers. Security threats to our
information systems, end points and networks have the potential to impact our customers as well. Security researchers, criminal
hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate our end points, information systems and network
security measures. And, as we have previously disclosed, certain unauthorized parties have in the past managed to gain access to
and misuse some of our systems and software in order to access our end users’ authentication, payment and personal information.
In addition, cyber-attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools and other malicious software
programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, services, information systems or networks. Hardware,
software and operating system applications that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or
manufacture, including bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system
or impair a customer’s ability to operate or use our products. The costs to prevent, eliminate, mitigate, or alleviate cyber- or other
security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts
to address these problems, including notifying affected parties, may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in
interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency
or impact these problems may have on us.
Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products
or services to disclose sensitive, personal, or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics.
Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or
attempt to gain logical access to our products, services, or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data.
These actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized
dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their
end users, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms
of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information.
This may result in litigation and liability or fines, our compliance with costly and time-intensive notice requirements, governmental
inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation,
possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources
to repair our brand and reputation. These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and
services and store and process more data, including personal information.Table of Contents
24
These problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular
offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be identified in some of our
applications and services and those of our third-party service providers. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications and
services to crash and could allow an attacker to access our or our users’ confidential or personal information or take control of the
affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and
services to customers. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products,
enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests,
deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, reviewing our service providers’ security controls, reviewing and auditing
our hosted services against independent security control frameworks (such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI), and improving our
incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our
operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent cyber-attackers from gaining
unauthorized access into our systems and products. Despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities
in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and
could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services,
or to use competing products or services. If we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if
our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our
business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer
systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Further, if we, our supply chain, or our customers are subject
to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, we could be subject to costly and time-intensive notice
requirements, and it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take
appropriate responsive and preventative steps. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. Moreover,
delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or preventative measures could
adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.
Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform
solutions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”) in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The
complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including:
•the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our
products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;
•the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements
prior to making information technology expenditures;
•the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and
evaluation of our products and services;
•intensifying competition within the industry; 
•the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;
•the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due
to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments within customers’ organizations; and
•customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately
purchase our solutions. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and
could have a greater impact on our results of operations.  Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven,
where a higher percentage of a quarter’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.
Our extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.
If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results
could suffer.
Our Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings typically involve subscription-based offerings
pursuant to product and service agreements. Revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably over the
term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions
for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and customers may not renew their subscriptions at the
same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. Moreover, under certainTable of Contents
25
circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the terms. Our varied
customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription-based agreements complicates our ability
to precisely forecast renewal rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer
renewal rates.
Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction
with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription
offerings, the prices of offerings and those offered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information security of our systems
and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers’ spending levels or declines in customer
activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions
or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.
We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.
As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas,
we are subject to a number of risks, including:
•foreign currency fluctuations and controls;
•international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad
and the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union (Brexit);
•tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);
•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
•changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
•failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
•inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;
•delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;
•the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand
our business;
•costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;
•operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
•other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.
Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks and if our third-
party business partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks, our business may be harmed. If sales to any of our customers
outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.
Our business could be harmed if we fail to effectively manage critical strategic third-party business relationships.
As our offerings expand and our customer base grows, our relationships with strategic partners become increasingly valuable.
If our contractual relationships with these third parties were to terminate, or if we were unable to renew on favorable terms, our
business could be harmed. This is especially the case when the third party’s offerings are integrated with our products and services,
or where the third party’s offerings are difficult to substitute or replace. Alternative arrangements for such products and services
may not be available to us, or on commercially reasonable terms, and we may experience business interruptions upon a transition
to an alternative partner. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable products and services or to update their technology may
result in a disruption to our business operations and those of our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us
to lose customers and damage our reputation.Table of Contents

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may
disrupt our business and management.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of a company, division, product or technology,
each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:
•inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
•difficulty in, and the cost of, effectively integrating the operations, technologies, products or services, and personnel
of the acquired business;
•entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger
market positions;
•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities
and challenges;
•inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
•inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
•inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
•incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating
results;
•elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;
•increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business
models;
•additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to a multinational
corporation;
•difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;
•impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our
technologies, products or services;
•failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired
company or technology;
•exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an
acquisition, such as claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;
•incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
•inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
•inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent
such acquisitions; 
•the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
•delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service
offerings; and
•incompatibility of business cultures.
Mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky. If we do not complete an announced acquisition
transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition
to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.Table of Contents
27
We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.
We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally.
These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control,
data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated
content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition,
employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory
requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and
may at times conflict. For example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to
engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents and business partners will not take actions in violation of
our internal policies or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes
in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages,
criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our
reputation. 
In addition, approximately 48% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly, we are exposed to
changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations
regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation
rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. 
Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any
of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.
As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic
and political conditions, both domestically and globally, including trends toward protectionism and nationalism. Uncertainty about
the effects of current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult
for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do
business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could
result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and
increased price competition. Among our customers are government entities, including the U.S. federal government, and our revenue
could decline if spending cuts impact the government’s ability to purchase our products and services. Deterioration in economic
conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable,
which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and
affect our derivative counterparties. Any of these events would likely harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would
also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.  
We generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which
typically range from 1 to 36 months. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of
subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may
not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter. Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue
in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully
reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly
increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new
customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. 
Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could
affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative
licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual
results may vary materially from those anticipated.Table of Contents
28
Changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and
results of operations.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“GAAP”). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and
create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the adoption of new
accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results, and could even retroactively affect previously reported
transactions, and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we
change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. For additional
information regarding these new standards, see the section titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective” within
Part II. Item 8, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and income, or cause
an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results. 
Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted
into law on December 22, 2017, changed existing U.S. tax law applicable to us and included certain international provisions
effective for us starting in fiscal 2019. The applicability and impact of these new tax provisions, and of other international tax law
changes effective for fiscal 2020 and beyond, will likely require us to respond by making change(s) to our international trading
structure. The net impact of such change(s) is uncertain but is anticipated to adversely affect our effective income tax rate and
cash flows in years beyond fiscal 2020. 
Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to
discrete items including, but not limited to, the effects of tax credits, stock-based compensation and settlements of tax examinations,
and to tax on earnings from foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations.
Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income
is earned, by changes in our repatriation policy, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions
in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by
unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation
of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
In addition, in countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those
covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we
are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to
tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental
economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented
assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and
historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. In the current
global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely
affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and
other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing
practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine
the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We
cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating
results and financial position.
If our products or platforms are used to create or disseminate objectionable content, particularly misleading content intended
to manipulate public opinion, our brand reputation may be damaged, and our business and financial results may be harmed.
We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the
brands within Adobe increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the
needs of our customers. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of customers.
Our brands may be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to create or disseminate newsworthy content that is
deemed to be misleading, deceptive, or intended to manipulate public opinion (e.g. “DeepFakes”), by the use of our products orTable of Contents
29
services for illicit, objectionable, or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and expeditiously to such uses of our
products and services. Such uses of our products and services may also cause us to face claims related to defamation, rights of
publicity and privacy, illegal content, misinformation and personal injury torts. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require
us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable
content created using our products or services or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands and our
business and financial results may be adversely affected.
The success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers
of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.
The success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to attract
new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain existing
customers and contributors. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which
increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our
online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers
and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our
collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our
results of operations.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including
our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade
secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. Preventing
unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as
we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy
activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. We apply for patents in the U.S. and
internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable to obtain patent protection for the technology described
in our pending patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely, this could result in revenue loss, adverse effects on operations and
harm to our business. We offer our products and services in foreign countries and we may seek intellectual property protection
from those foreign legal systems. Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property
protection laws and schemes as those offered in the U.S. In some foreign countries, the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property
rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business.  
If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose
future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties
to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our
revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-
disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However, there is a risk that our confidential
information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights
may be difficult or costly.
We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.
We have been, are currently, and may in the future be, subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation
relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights.
Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the
attention of management and key personnel. We may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property
disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into
royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of
our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the
markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual
provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring
the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with
our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.
Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business.
Global economic events, including trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty
may cause currencies to fluctuate. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on ourTable of Contents
30
judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly review our program to partially hedge
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary. Our hedging activities may not offset more than
a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could
adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
Failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers’ requests could
harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.
Our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services. We
outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. We depend
heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to
continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not
be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities.
Our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially
if these third-party organizations are based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical
support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose
customers and associated revenue.
Revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to
decline.
In the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. A
number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as:
•shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about, our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”),
sales of our Digital Experience offerings, or other key performance metrics;
•changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
•whether our results meet analysts’ expectations;
•compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies;
•the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or
significant agreements by us or our competitors;
•the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new
customers;
•recruitment or departure of key personnel;
•variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and
developments in our industry; 
•general socio-economic, political or market conditions; and
•unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and
other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. 
In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general may experience uneven investor confidence,
which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. V olatility
in the market price of a company’s securities for a period of time may increase the company’s susceptibility to securities class
action litigation. Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources which may
adversely affect our business. 
Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process. 
We provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities, both domestically and
internationally. Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended
sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and
other government-specific contractual requirements. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government
contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including terminationTable of Contents
31
of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation
and financial results.
If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management.
These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could
harm our business, especially if we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business is also dependent
on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. Our efforts to
attract, develop, integrate and retain highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications may be compounded by intensified
restrictions on travel, immigration, or the availability of work visas. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry
are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. We may experience
higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity
or increased sales. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. 
We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower
costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures. Nonetheless,
as globalization continues, competition for these employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to
retain these employees and increase our expenses resulting from competitive compensation. We may continue to expand our
international operations and international sales and marketing activities, which would require significant management attention
and resources. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our
revenue may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, causing our results to suffer.  
We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster
innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired
in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture,
which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
Failure to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
We contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which are individually responsible
for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. Nonetheless, if any single agreement with one of our distributors
were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and
services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors
and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel
partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to,
export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior. 
We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively. If
our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. Our distributors also sell our
competitors’ products and services, and if they favor our competitors’ products or services for any reason, they may fail to market
our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to
suffer. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs decide not to bundle our
applications on their devices, our results could suffer. In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing
relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in
economic conditions, which could result in insolvency, the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of
our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us.
We also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel
include more extended sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and
motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives. Moreover, recent hires
may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full
productivity. Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase
in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact
our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.Table of Contents

If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to
earnings.
GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. In addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable
intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible
assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our
industry. Depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated
financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined,
negatively impacting our results of operations.
We have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and have a $2.25 billion term loan, and may incur other debt in the future,
which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. 
We have $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes and a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan outstanding. We also have a
$1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial
condition and future financial results by, among other things: 
•increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;
•requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby
reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;
and
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain
compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.
If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure
periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our
debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if
our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility
and Term Loan could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our
ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology
systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, some
of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving
our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or
third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss,
telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic
event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of
intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss
of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders or could negatively impact a country
or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’s or region’s demand for our products. Our
corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain
other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant
operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results
in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely
affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
 While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize
that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where
we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority. Our major sites in California, Utah and India are
vulnerable to climate change effects. For example, in California, increasing intensity of drought throughout the state and annual
periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages in the communities where we work and live. WhileTable of Contents
33
this danger has a low-assessed risk of disrupting normal business operations, it has the potential impact on employees’ abilities to
commute to work and to stay connected. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events
and their impact on U.S., India and other major regions’ critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-
party suppliers, and/or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses, and additional costs
to maintain or resume operations. To accurately assess and take potential proactive action as appropriate, Adobe is aligned with
the guidelines of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations and the
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board environmental metrics.
Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.
Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of November 29, 2019  consisted of asset-backed securities,
corporate debt securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and U.S. Treasury securities. We follow
an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk.
The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various
asset classes.
Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising
from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and
expense to vary from expectations. As of November 29, 2019 , we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-
term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we
cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment
portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.Table of Contents

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights,
including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted
litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by
diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or
resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual
property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable
terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our
sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy
indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service
agreements.
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and, based on known facts, assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations,
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise
specifically disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, we have determined that no provision for liability
or disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding
amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss
cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our piracy conversion efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business
Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to
counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to
such counter-claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be
negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims.Table of Contents

38ACQUISITIONS 
During fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately held 3D editing
and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately  $106.2 million  in cash consideration, and
integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment.
During fiscal 2018, we completed our acquisitions of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for
$4.73 billion  and Magento, a privately held commerce platform company, for $1.64 billion , and integrated them into our Digital
Experience reportable segment.
During fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for
$560.8 million , and integrated it into our Digital Experience reportable segment. 
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. 
See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions, including
pro forma financial information related to the Marketo acquisition.  Pro forma information has not been presented for our other
acquisitions during the fiscal years presented as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical
experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and
estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business
combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key
components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and
consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates
relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
Revenue Recognition 
Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both
on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services
are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other,
and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/
on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are
not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for
which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud
and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that
operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates
cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow
efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.
Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with
the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access
their work, settings, preferences, and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in
real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile, and web; automatic
cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial
intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-
awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition, and automated document tagging.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make
significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the
assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and
information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates
in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and
acquired developed technologies and patents;
•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired
trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;
•the expected use of the acquired assets; and 
•discount rates.
In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue
obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-
up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. 
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates
or actual results.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates
to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax
laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic
tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could
be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our
intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from
these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that
may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these
examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview of 2019
For fiscal 2019 , we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our
two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Experience, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of
products and solutions.
On December 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, we adopted the requirements of the new revenue standard
utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition, and began to report our financial results under the new revenue standard.
The impact of the adoption was not significant to our results of operations. 
In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides
desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative
Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled
services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to
marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools
which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained
long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users as a result of low cost of
entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest
release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content
in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users,
attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.
We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our
Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop
and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and
ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License
Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.
We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products,
including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat
provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document
Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes
Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track
documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through
subscription and perpetual licenses.
Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health
and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue, unbilled
backlog and remaining performance obligation as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of
these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR
results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year.
We calculate ARR as follows:

Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2019  was $7.31 billion , up from $5.92 billion  at the end of fiscal 2018 . Document Cloud ARR
exiting fiscal 2019  was $1.09 billion , up from $791 million  at the end of fiscal 2018 . Total Digital Media ARR grew to $8.40
billion  at the end of fiscal 2019 , up from $6.71 billion  at the end of fiscal 2018 . Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2019  using
currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2019 , our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2019  would be $8.33 billion  or
approximately $66 million  lower  than the ARR reported above.
Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2019  was
$6.48 billion , up from $5.34 billion  in fiscal 2018  and representing 21% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal
2019  was $1.22 billion , up from $981.8 million  in fiscal 2018  and representing 25% year-over-year revenue growth. Total Digital
Media segment revenue grew to $7.71 billion  in fiscal 2019 , up from $6.33 billion  in fiscal 2018  and representing 22% year-over-
year growth. 
We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. Our Digital Experience
business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management,
cross-channel campaign management, marketing automation, audience management, commerce, premium video delivery and
monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and
digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance.
During fiscal 2019, our hierarchy of solutions in the Digital Experience segment consisted of the following cloud offerings:
•Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital
formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens.
•Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating
audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through
the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that
data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager.
•Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage
their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes
Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Marketo Engage and Adobe Primetime.
•Adobe Commerce Cloud—provides digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence based on a unified
commerce platform enabling shopping experiences across a wide array of industries; includes Magento Commerce. 
In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions
include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and
information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe
products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our
Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their
content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of
partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our
solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market,
and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. 
We achieved record Digital Experience revenue of $3.21 billion  in fiscal 2019 , up from $2.44 billion  in fiscal 2018  which
represents 31% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which
grew to  $2.67 billion  in fiscal  2019  from  $1.95 billion  in fiscal  2018 , representing  37% year-over-year growth. Largely
contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Marketo Engage. To a lesser
extent, subscription revenue associated with Magento Commerce and Adobe Experience Manager also contributed to the overall
increase. We expect that continued demand across our portfolio of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, including new offerings
and enhancements to existing solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.Table of Contents

Our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the new revenue standard that was adopted under the
modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Prior period results have not been restated which limits the
comparability of our results of operations for fiscal 2019 when compared to the year-ago period. See Note 2 of our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding adoption of the new revenue standard. 
Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2019
•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $8.40 billion  as of November 29, 2019  increased  by $1.69 billion , or 25%,
from $6.71 billion  as of November 30, 2018 . The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to stronger new
user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud offerings. 
•Creative revenue of $6.48 billion  increased by $1.14 billion , or 21%, during fiscal 2019 , from $5.34 billion  in fiscal
2018 . The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud
offerings.
•Digital Experience revenue of $3.21 billion  increased  by $762.4 million , or 31%, during fiscal 2019 , from $2.44 billion
in fiscal 2018 . The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue driven by the addition of Marketo
and Magento, which we acquired in the later part of fiscal 2018.
•Our total deferred revenue of $3.50 billion  as of November 29, 2019  increased  by $447.1 million , or 15%, from $3.05
billion  as of November 30, 2018 . The increase was primarily due to increases in new contracts and the timing of
renewals for offerings with cloud-enabled services and hosted services. 
•Cost of revenue of $1.67 billion  increased  by $477.7 million , or 40%, during fiscal 2019 , from $1.19 billion  in fiscal
2018 . The increase was primarily due to increases in amortization of intangibles from our acquisition of Magento and
Marketo in the later part of fiscal 2018. To a lesser extent, increases in hosting services and data center costs also
contributed to the overall increase in cost of revenue. 
•Operating expenses of $6.23 billion  increased  by $1.24 billion , or 25%, during fiscal 2019 , from $4.99 billion  in fiscal
2018 . The increase was primarily due to increases in base compensation and related benefits costs and stock-based
compensation expense associated with headcount growth, including additions from the acquisitions of Magento and
Marketo in the later part of fiscal 2018. To a lesser extent, increases in marketing spend also contributed to the overall
increase in operating expenses. 
•Net income of $2.95 billion  increased  by $360.7 million , or 14%, during fiscal 2019  from $2.59 billion  in fiscal 2018
primarily due to increases in revenue and offset in part by the increases in operating expenses and cost of revenue. 
•Net cash flow from operations of $4.42 billion  during fiscal 2019  increased  by $392.5 million , or 10%, from $4.03
billion  during fiscal 2018  primarily due to higher net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. This increase
was offset in part by comparatively lower increases in income taxes payable and higher increases in prepaid expenses
and other assets. Table of Contents

Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased  $1.38 billion  during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018 , driven by increases in
revenue associated with our Creative and Document Cloud offerings. Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which
includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed Creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2019 . The
increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue across all of our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases
in net new subscriptions. Adobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service,
increased during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to increases in subscription revenue driven by strong adoption
of our Document Cloud.Table of Contents

Digital Experience
Revenue from Digital Experience increased  $762.5 million  during fiscal 2019 , as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due
to subscription revenue growth across our Experience Cloud offerings. Largely contributing to the subscription revenue increases
were revenue associated with Marketo Engage, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and revenue associated
with our Magento Commerce offerings. Also contributing to the subscription revenue growth were increases in our AEM and
Campaign offerings.

Overall revenue during fiscal 2019  increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to increases
in Digital Media and Digital Experience revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment
were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. 
Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  were impacts associated with foreign currency as
shown below. Our cash flow hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

 During fiscal 2019 , the U.S. Dollar strengthened against EMEA and other currencies, which decreased revenue in U.S.
Dollar equivalents. The foreign currency impact to revenue was offset in part by hedging gains primarily from our EMEA currencies
cash flow hedging programs during fiscal 2019.
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of revenue by geography.
Backlog
Adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in changes to our measurement of unbilled backlog starting in fiscal 2019
such that orders with a right of termination and unbilled amounts recognized as revenue under the new revenue standard are not
included in our unbilled backlog, consistent with our measurement of remaining performance obligations. Our unbilled backlog
represents expected future billings not yet recognized in revenue that are contractually committed under our existing subscription
agreements. As of November 29, 2019 , we had unbilled backlog of $6.38 billion , which excludes amounts cancellable without
substantive penalty. Approximately $2.61 billion  of our unbilled backlog is not reasonably expected to be recognized during fiscalTable of Contents
44
2020. As of November 30, 2018 , we had unbilled backlog of approximately $5.05 billion , which was measured under the accounting
standard in effect for that period.
We expect that the amount of unbilled backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing
and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, timing of customer renewals,
timing of revenue recognition, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Our presentation
of unbilled backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. Table of Contents

Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure,
including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and
related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of
certain intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for hosting services and use of data
center facilities. Our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar

Amortization of Intangibles
During the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of
these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to
fifteen  years.
Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to amortization of intangible
assets purchased through our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo in the later part of fiscal 2018 and partially offset by certain
fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions. Table of Contents

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net  
Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed
income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and
foreign exchange gains and losses.
Interest Expense
Interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our Term Loan, senior notes and interest rate swaps. In October
2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $2.25 billion  senior unsecured term loan for the purpose of partially
funding the purchase price for our acquisition of Marketo. Interest on our Term Loan is payable periodically at the end of each
interest period, whereas interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating
interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-
annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.  See Notes 6  and 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further details regarding our interest rate swaps and debt, respectively.  
Interest expense increased  during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to interest on our Term Loan which
was entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Investment Gains (Losses), Net
Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred
compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect
investments in privately held companies.
Investment gains increased during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to the gain recognized upon our
acquisition of the remaining interest in Allegorithmic in January 2019, which was accounted for as an equity-method investment
immediately before the acquisition. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding
our acquisition of Allegorithmic.Table of Contents
48Provision for Income Taxes 
 (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017% Change
2019-2018% Change
2018-2017
Provision $ 253.3 $ 203.1 $ 443.7 25% (54)%
Percentage of total revenue 2% 2% 6%
Effective tax rate 8% 7% 21%
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately one percentage point during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018 . The
effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 included U.S. federal and state taxes associated with our current year international earnings
resulting from the international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) effective this year and for additional foreign
taxation on our foreign operations. This increase was offset in part by the provisional accounting expense recorded in the prior
year for the effects of the Tax Act adoption.
Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 14 percentage points during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.  The
lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, which included the reduction
in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018, and a related change to our
corporate tax structure from which we serve our foreign customers that provided us the ability to deduct more expenses against
our earnings in the U.S.
Beginning in our fiscal 2019, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21% and certain international provisions of
the Tax Act, such as a tax on global intangible low-tax income, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax and a special tax deduction for
foreign-derived intangible income, took effect. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations that could impact
the calculation of taxes related to these provisions and which are anticipated to be applicable on a retroactive basis. While the
Company continues to evaluate the impact, such regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. We will account
for new regulations in the period of enactment.
We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making
such a determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, forecasted
earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to
maintain a valuation allowance related primarily to the realizability of state and foreign credits. Total valuation allowance was
$244.4 million as of November 29, 2019 . 
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. The Tax Act provides an exemption
from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings
that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign
earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax.
Subsequent to November 29, 2019 , final and proposed tax regulations were issued that are applicable to Adobe. We are
currently evaluating the impact of these enacted and issued regulations, but we do not anticipate they will have a material impact
to our fiscal 2020 operating results.
The Tax Act included certain international provisions effective for us starting in fiscal 2019. As discussed in Part 1. Item
1A. Risk Factors, the applicability and impact of these new tax provisions, and of other international tax law changes effective
for fiscal 2020 and beyond, will likely require us to respond by making change(s) to our international trading structure. The net
impact of such change(s) is uncertain but is anticipated to adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in years
beyond fiscal 2020. 
See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $173.3 million , $196.2 million  and
$172.9 million  for fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 29, 2019 ,
November 30, 2018  and December 1, 2017  were recognized, $127.0 million , $145.2 million  and $135.0 million  would decrease
the respective effective tax rates.
The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately
$25.1 million  and $24.6 million  for fiscal 2019  and 2018 , respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes
payable in their respective years.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our
tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude
or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above,
we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to
approximately $20 million .
In addition, in countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those
covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we
are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to
tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental
economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented
assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and
historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. In the current
global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely
affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign
tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other
matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance
that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
position.Table of Contents

Working Capital
Working capital as of November 29, 2019  and November 30, 2018  was $1.70 billion  of a deficit and $555.9 million  of a
surplus, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of $3.15 billion  total carrying value of our $2.25 billion
term loan due April 30, 2020 (“Term Loan”) and $900 million  4.75%  senior notes due February 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”) to current
liabilities. We intend to refinance our Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates.

stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses,
general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business
acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
For fiscal 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities of $4.42 billion  was primarily comprised of net income adjusted
for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with an increase in
deferred revenue, which was offset in large part by cash outflows due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The
increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by increases related to Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services and
Digital Experience hosted services. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses with certain
vendors, sales commissions paid and capitalized, advanced payments related to income taxes and increase in long-term contract
assets.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For fiscal 2019 , net cash used for investing activities of $455.6 million  was primarily due to  purchases of property and
equipment and our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Allegorithmic. These cash outflows were offset primarily by
proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For fiscal 2019 , net cash used for financing activities was $2.95 billion  primarily due to payments for our treasury stock
repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury
stock for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.
We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, facilities expansion and
purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff.
Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire
companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Table of Contents

Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations
Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2020  due to changes in our planned
cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct costs and integration costs related to our acquisitions. 
Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed
in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our
existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility
will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
We have a $1 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of
lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of November 29, 2019 , there were
no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion  credit line remains available for borrowing. 
As of November 29, 2019 , we have a  $2.25 billion  Term Loan outstanding and $1.9 billion  senior notes outstanding,
consisting of our 2020 Notes and $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with the
2020 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes and Term Loan rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the 2020 Notes as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the Term Loan as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As
of November 29, 2019 , the carrying value of the 2020 Notes was $899.6 million  which includes the fair value of the related interest
rate swap and is net of debt issuance costs, and the carrying value of the Term Loan was $2.25 billion , net of unamortized original
issuance discount. We intend to refinance the Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our Term Loan and 2020 Notes, we entered into
Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional
amount of $1 billion  of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark
interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon debt issuance.
Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, municipal
securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our
investment portfolio. 
Stock Repurchase Program
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May
2018, our Board of Directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to $8 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal
2021.
During fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.75 billion , $2.05 billion , and $1.10 billion , respectively.
We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the V olume Weighted
Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the
discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There
were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement
for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. 
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon
discount. Table of Contents

For fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 29, 2019 , November 30, 2018  and December 1,
2017  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 29, 2019 , $229.2 million  of prepayments remained
under the agreement. 
Subsequent to November 29, 2019 , we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution
whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $850 million . This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $850 million  stock repurchase agreement, $4.25 billion  remains under our
May 2018 authority. 
See Item 5, Market for Registrant’ s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 29, 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
 Our principal commitments as of November 29, 2019  consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements
and various service agreements. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
our contractual commitments.

Total $7,121.3 $ 3,860.7 $ 1,158.8 $ 747.6 $ 1,354.2
As of November 29, 2019 , our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion . At our election, the Term Loan will bear
interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500%
to 1.000%  or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110% . Interest is payable periodically,
in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. Based on the LIBOR rate at November 29, 2019 , our estimated maximum
commitment for interest payments was $23.2 million  for the remaining duration of the Term Loan.
As of November 29, 2019 , the carrying value of our Notes payable was $1.89 billion . Interest on our Notes is payable semi-
annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 29, 2019 , our maximum commitment for interest payments was
$200.1 million  for the remaining duration of our Notes.
Our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement contain similar financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum
leverage ratio. As of November 29, 2019 , we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our
credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our senior notes do not contain any
financial covenants.Table of Contents
52
Under the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends
unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.
Transition Taxes Liability
As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, an accrued transition tax liability of approximately $427.1 million
as of November 29, 2019  is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income
taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject
to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in
the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax. 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
See Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes  above and Note10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
Royalties
We have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. Royalty expense is generally based
on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against
claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we
are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification
provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions
on our future results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for
certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director
and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Table of Contents
53ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.
Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us
to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge
our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with
foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely
affected by changes in exchange rates. 
Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were as follows :
(in millions, except Japanese Yen) 2019 2018 2017
Euro € 1,603.2 € 1,309.9 € 1,044.7
Japanese Yen (in billions) ¥ 73.2 ¥ 60.8 ¥ 51.0
British Pounds £ 503.3 £ 423.1 £ 338.4
As of November 29, 2019 , the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and
forwards, was $1.90 billion , which included the notional equivalent of $927.0 million  in Euros, $431.0 million  in British Pounds,
$341.3 million  in Japanese Yen and $201.8 million  in other foreign currencies. As of November 29, 2019 , all contracts were set
to expire at various dates through June 2020. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses
that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement
transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the
net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 29, 2019 . This sensitivity
analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S.
Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and
a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our
financial hedging instruments by $113.6 million . Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a
decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $33.4 million .
As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in
countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the
local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and
retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 29, 2019  and November 30,
2018 , this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $385.2 million  and $292.3 million , respectively,
with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment
exposures.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure
in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and
assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.
Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue 
We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in
Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows
will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities
between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course
of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.
We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify
the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it
becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended November 29, 2019 , there were no net gains or losses recognized
in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.
Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities
Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use
to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash
flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at
fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated
Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At
November 29, 2019 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.
See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial instruments.Table of Contents

Interest Rate Risk
Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities
At November 29, 2019 , we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.53 billion . Changes in interest
rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio
as of November 29, 2019 . The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that
would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.
The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming
immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of
November 29, 2019  and November 30, 2018 :
 (dollars in millions)
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
11/29/19 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 1,544.8 $ 1,538.8 $ 1,532.8 $ 1,526.8 $ 1,520.7 $ 1,514.7 $ 1,508.7
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
11/30/18 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 1,617.5 $ 1,607.1 $ 1,596.6 $ 1,586.2 $ 1,575.7 $ 1,565.3 $ 1,554.8
Term Loan 
As of November 29, 2019 , our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion . At our election, the Term Loan will bear
interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500%  to 1.000%  or (ii) a base rate plus a
margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110% . Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each
interest period we elect. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have
a significant impact on our results of operations.
Senior Notes
As of November 29, 2019 , the amount outstanding under our Notes was $1.9 billion . In June 2014, we entered into interest
rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a
fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the
hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million . An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates
would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.
As of November 29, 2019 , the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.89 billion  and the related fair value based on
observable market prices in less active markets was $1.96 billion .
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion  Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million  notes payable
due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S.
Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion  of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the
impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our anticipated
refinancing. We record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) until the anticipated refinancing. Upon refinancing and termination of the derivative instruments, their fair value
will be amortized over the term of our new debt to interest expense.Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
62NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Operations
Founded in 1982, Adobe Inc. is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of
products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, students, application developers, enterprises
and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and
experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers
through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at
www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both
of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute
certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, independent software
vendors, retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology
to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run
on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have
operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all
intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Use of Estimates
In preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-
based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets, litigation and income taxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Fiscal years 2019 , 2018  and 2017
were 52-week years. 
Reclassifications
Certain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance 
On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it
expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. Topic 606 also includes Subtopic 340-40, Other
Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, which requires the capitalization of incremental costs to obtain a contract
with a customer. The new revenue standard replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and permits the use of
either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. 
On December 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, we adopted the requirements of the new revenue standard
utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition. Prior period information has not been restated and continues to be reported
under the accounting standard in effect for those periods. We applied the new revenue standard to contracts that were not completed
as of the adoption date, consistent with the transition guidance. Further, adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in changes
to our accounting policies for revenue recognition and sales commissions as detailed below. 
We recognized the following cumulative effects of initially applying the new revenue standard as of December 1, 2018:

Below is a summary of the adoption impacts of the new revenue standard:
•We capitalized $413.2 million  of contract acquisition costs comprised of sales and partner commission costs at adoption
date (included in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term
portion), with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings. We are amortizing these costs over their respective
expected period of benefit.
•Revenue for certain contracts that were previously deferred would have been recognized in periods prior to adoption
under the new standard. Upon adoption, we recorded the following adjustments to our beginning balances to reflect
the amount of revenue that will no longer be recognized in future periods for such contracts: an increase in unbilled
receivables (included in trade receivables, net) of $24.8 million , an increase in contract assets (included in prepaid
expenses and other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion) of $46.4 million
and a decrease in deferred revenue of $52.8 million , with corresponding adjustments to retained earnings.
•We recorded an increase to our opening deferred income tax liability of $82.8 million , with a corresponding adjustment
to retained earnings, to record the tax effect of the above adjustments. 
•Further, we had other impacts to various accounts which resulted to an immaterial net reduction to our retained earnings.Table of Contents

There was no net impact to our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows resulting from the adoption of the new revenue standard other than the impact to reported net income as presented above.
The impact to our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity was only to retained earnings, as presented above. 
The most significant impact of the new revenue standard relates to our capitalization of certain incremental costs to acquire
contracts and the requirement to amortize these amounts over the expected period of benefit. Under the previous standard, we
expensed costs related to the acquisition of revenue-generating contracts as incurred. Additionally, there was impact from
arrangements with our customers that include on-premise term-based software licenses bundled with maintenance and support.
Under the previous standard, revenue attributable to these software licenses was recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement
because vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) did not exist for the undelivered maintenance and support element as it is
not sold separately. The requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue recognition for
delivered software licenses is eliminated under the new revenue standard. Accordingly, under the new revenue standard we recognize
as revenue a portion of the arrangement fee upon delivery of the software licenses and classify that recognized revenue as product
revenue instead of subscription revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
64
Other impacts to our policies and disclosures include earlier recognition of revenue for certain contracts due to the elimination
of contingent revenue limitations, the requirement to estimate variable consideration for certain arrangements, increased allocation
of revenue to and from professional services and other offerings and changes to our financial statement disclosures such as new
disclosures related to our remaining performance obligations. However, the timing and pattern of revenue recognition related to
our professional services and cloud-enabled offerings, including Creative Cloud and Document Cloud for enterprises, individuals
and teams, remain substantially unchanged. When Creative Cloud and Document Cloud are sold with cloud-enabled services, the
on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud-enabled services are so highly interrelated and interdependent that they are not
each separately identifiable within the context of the contract and therefore not distinct from each other. Revenue for these offerings
continues to be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.
There have been no other new accounting pronouncements made effective during fiscal 2019  that have significance, or
potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty,
and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical
support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.
Revenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be capable of being distinct
and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and
Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any
taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Product, Subscription and Services Offerings
We enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions,
cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans,
consulting services, training and technical support.
Fully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without
taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based
on consumption or usage.
We recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed
number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on
the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through
the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance
with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration.
Fees based on a number of transactions or impressions per month, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance,
customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for
subscriptions sold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and
consumes the benefit of the underlying service.
When cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled
Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized
ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.
Licenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or
based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from distinct on-premise licenses is recognized at the
point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classified as
product revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Some of our enterprise license arrangements allow customers toTable of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
65
commit non-cancellable funds. These non-cancellable committed funds are nonrefundable and provide our customers options to
either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services.
Revenue associated with these monthly term-based licenses is classified as subscription revenue.
Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training, and maintenance and support, primarily related to
our enterprise offerings. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer
organizations related to our desktop products. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials basis and recognize
the related revenue as services are rendered. We typically sell our maintenance and support contracts on a flat fee or percentage
of associated license fees basis and recognize the related revenue ratably over the support term as the underlying service is a stand-
ready performance obligation.
We exclude from the transaction price sales and other taxes collected from customers on behalf of the relevant government
authority. Most of our products are delivered electronically, however in instances where shipping and handling costs are incurred,
we treat these amounts as costs to fulfill the contract and they are not considered a performance obligation and the associated fees
are not included in the transaction price.
Judgments
Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both
on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services
are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other,
and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/
on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are
not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for
which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and
Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates
seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based
and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies
that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.
Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with
the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access
their work, settings, preferences, and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in
real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile and web; automatic
cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial
intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-
awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.
Standalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling
prices for performance obligations where available, and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market model and
geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are
sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the performance
obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include reviewing
pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.
Capitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based
on analysis, to be 5 years . We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including
contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period of
benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical
expedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data used to determine the
amortization period. 
When revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which
involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal,
and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtainTable of Contents

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
66
control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party
is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in establishing price
and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.
We offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our
distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as variable consideration
when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on a
portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when additional information becomes available.
General Contract Provisions
We maintain revenue reserves for rebates, rights of return and other limited price adjustments.
Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors
are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced
by new versions.
We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts
based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting.
On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to
each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a percent
of revenue to determine a historical reserve rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for
estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve in excess of portfolio-level estimated requirements.
This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other
factors.
Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel
their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term and consumers
have a period of time to terminate certain agreements without penalty. In the event a customer cancels their contract, they are
generally not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them. Contracts that include termination rights without
substantive penalty are accounted for as contracts only for the committed period. Periods of time after the right of termination are
accounted for as optional purchases when they do not represent material rights. For certain of our usage-based license agreements,
typically in our royalty and OEM businesses, reporting may be received after the end of a fiscal period. In such instances, we
estimate and accrue license revenue. We base our estimates on multiple factors, including historical sales information, seasonality
and other business information which may impact our estimates. We do not estimate variable consideration for our sales and usage-
based license royalty agreements, consistent with the associated exception for sales and usage-based royalties for the license of
intellectual property under the new revenue standard.
Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 20 years for computers and other
equipment, which includes our corporate jet, 1 to 6 years for furniture and fixtures, 5 to 20 years for building improvements and
up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining
respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.
Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment
annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any one of our reporting units below its respective carrying amount. In performing
our goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment, which requires that we consider events or circumstances
including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in
management or key personnel, changes in strategy, changes in customers, changes in the composition or carrying amount of a
reporting segment’s net assets and changes in our stock price. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determineTable of Contents

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
67
that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting segments are greater than the carrying amounts, then the quantitative
goodwill impairment test is not performed.
If the qualitative assessment indicates that the quantitative analysis should be performed, we then evaluate goodwill for
impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill.
To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies
in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions
consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . We determined, after performing
a qualitative review of each reporting segment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting segments
substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative
goodwill impairment test was not performed. We did not identify any events or changes in circumstances since the performance
of our annual goodwill impairment test that would require us to perform another goodwill impairment test during the fiscal year.
We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever
an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts
of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances
occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize
an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible
asset impairment charges in fiscal 2019 , 2018  or 2017 .
During fiscal 2019 , our intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.
Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line
basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:
Weighted
Average
Useful Life
(years )
Customer contracts and relationships 10
Purchased technology 6
Trademarks 9
Backlog 2
Acquired rights to use technology 10

Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities,
and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount
for which realization is more likely than not.
Taxes Collected from Customers
We net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements.
Accordingly, taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the
difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is
re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent thatTable of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
68
there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses
upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were $221.1 million ,
$173.6 million  and $141.7 million , respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation
We translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, at exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include
accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).
Derivative Financial Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use
foreign exchange option and forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue primarily
in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign
exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange
rates. 
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them
at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and
whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair
value through earnings. 
Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts which
hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each period as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue and Treasury
lock agreements are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted
transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency and Treasury lock cash flow hedges to
revenue and interest expense, respectively.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments,
structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.
Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers.
Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy.
Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of
credit risk exists with respect to these investments.
We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of
transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to
exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established
thresholds.
Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market,
customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors,
dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and require letters of credit
or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their
ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of paymentsTable of Contents

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
69
from their customers. Certain contracts with advertising agencies contain sequential liability provisions, under which the agency
is not required to pay until payment is received from the agency’s customers. In these circumstances, we evaluate the credit-
worthiness of the agency’s customers in addition to the agency itself. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a
customer where we have a reason to believe the customer’s ability and intention to pay is not probable, the arrangement is not
considered to be a revenue contract. Accordingly, we will not recognize any consideration received as revenue until termination
or substantive completion of the services.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
On February 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and
a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases with a lease term of twelve months or
less. For lessees, leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. Lessor accounting
is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model. Lessors will continue to classify
leases as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. The effective date of the new leases standard for public companies is for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The
new leases standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and we did not early adopt.
The new leases standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method and allows for the application
of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or at the adoption date. In July 2018, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases - Targeted Improvements, providing an optional transition method that allows entities to initially
apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings in the period of adoption. We will adopt the new leases standard using this optional transition method.
We have completed our assessment of the impacts of the standard, and note that the most significant impact will be the
recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The standard will not have a material
impact to our Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows. We are in the final stages of implementing a new lease accounting
system and updating our processes for the adoption of the new leases standard.
On August 28, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging, requiring expanded hedge accounting
for both non-financial and financial risk components and refining the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entity’s
hedging strategies. For example, adoption would result in reclassification of hedge costs from foreign currency hedges from interest
and other income (expense), net to revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The updated standard also amends the
presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how entities assess hedge effectiveness. The effective date of the new
standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition with a cumulative-effect
adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings as of the initial adoption date. The updated standard is effective for us beginning
in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related
disclosures.
With the exception of the new standards discussed above, there have been no other new accounting pronouncements that
have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Table of Contents

Segment Information
We report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.
Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each
of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception
of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. 
Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. These segments
provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our
two strategic growth opportunities as described in the “Business Overview” within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing business
in a third segment that contains some of our mature products and solutions.
In fiscal 2019 , we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:
•Digital Media —Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises
to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators,
experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as
marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who
create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content. 
•Digital Experience —Our Digital Experience segment provides products, services and solutions for creating, managing,
executing, measuring, monetizing and optimizing customer experiences from advertising to commerce. Our customers
include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists,
developers, marketing executives, information management and technology executives, product development
executives, and sales and support executives.  
•Publishing —Our Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse authoring and publishing
needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. It also includes our web

Contract Balances
Trade Receivables
A receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment exists, such that only the passage of
time is required before payment of consideration is due. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing
to customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer.
Included in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced,
and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing occurring.
The opening balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, as of December 1, 2018  was $1.36 billion ,
inclusive of unbilled receivables of $105.8 million . As of November 29, 2019 , the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances
for doubtful accounts, was $1.53 billion , inclusive of unbilled receivables of $149.3 million .Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
72
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables.
The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowance by considering
factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions
that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible. 
During fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , our allowance for doubtful accounts activities were as follows:
(in thousands) 2019 2018 2017
Beginning balance $ 14,981 $ 9,151 $ 6,214

Ending balance $ 9,650 $ 14,981 $ 9,151
________________________________________
(1) Deductions related to the allowance for doubtful accounts represent amounts written off against the allowance, less recoveries.
Contract Assets
A contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has occurred. Contract
assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated to the satisfied
performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review
contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, age of the balance and
other economic or business factors. Contract asset impairments were not significant in fiscal 2019 .
The opening balance of contract assets as of December 1, 2018  was $46.4 million . As of November 29, 2019 , the balance
of contract assets was $63.9 million .
Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations
Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription
services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and deposits. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue
when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments
and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several
factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity
within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription
agreements. 
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30
to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our
contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide
customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a
subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any
potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.
The adjusted opening balance of deferred revenue as of December 1, 2018  was $3.00 billion . As of November 29, 2019 ,
the balance of deferred revenue was $3.50 billion , inclusive of $265.4 million  of non-cancellable and non-refundable committed
funds and $56.9 million  of refundable customer deposits. Arrangements with non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds
provide our customers options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other
Adobe products or services. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral
cancellation right for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided
at the time of cancellation on a prorated basis.Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Significant movements in the deferred revenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received
prior to transfer of control of the underlying performance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through
business combinations, which were offset by decreases due to revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended November 29,
2019 , approximately $2.8 billion  of revenue was recognized that was included in the adjusted opening balance of deferred revenue
as of December 1, 2018.
Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been
recognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction
price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals and
average contract terms. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and
recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based royalties not yet
consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint in accordance with the new revenue
standard. 
Remaining performance obligations were approximately $9.82 billion  as of November 29, 2019 , which includes $776.4
million  of non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements.
Approximately 74% of the remaining performance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are
expected to be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.
Contract Acquisition Costs
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those
costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.
The costs capitalized under the new revenue standard are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel.
Capitalized costs may also include portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs
to acquire customer contracts and incentive payments to partners.
Capitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based
on analysis, to be 5 years . Amortization of capitalized costs are included in sales and marketing expense in our Consolidated
Statements of Income. During fiscal 2019 , we amortized $170.9 million  of capitalized contract acquisition costs into sales and
marketing expense. We did not incur any impairment losses.
The opening balance of capitalized contract acquisition costs as of December 1, 2018  was $413.2 million . As of
November 29, 2019 , the balance of capitalized contract acquisition costs was $473.7 million , of which $314.7 million  was long-
term and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining balance of the capitalized costs to obtain
contracts was current and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

75NOTE 3.  ACQUISITIONS
Allegorithmic
On January 23, 2019 , we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software
company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we
held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for
approximately $106.2 million  in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our
pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million .
In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0
million , which represents the difference between the $54.8 million  acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest
and our previous carrying amount. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic’s net tangible and
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the
net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million  was allocated
to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million  to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net
liabilities assumed.
Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated
Financial Statements was not material.
Marketo
On October 31, 2018 , we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for
approximately  $4.73 billion  of cash consideration. Adding Marketo’s engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers
our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions
to enable customers across industries and companies automate and orchestrate their marketing activities. Under the terms of the
Share Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Milestone Topco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Topco”) and indirect parent company of Marketo, and other equity interests in
Marketo. In connection with the acquisition, each Marketo equity award that was issued and outstanding was cancelled and
extinguished in exchange for cash consideration. Also pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon closing of the transaction, cash
was paid for the settlement of Marketo’s long-term incentive plan, the settlement of Marketo’s indebtedness and the acquisition
of all remaining equity interests in Marketo K.K., a Japanese corporation and joint venture. 
In connection with the acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $2.25 billion  senior unsecured term
loan (“Term Loan”). The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition and pay
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. The Term Loan funds were received on October 31, 2018 upon
closing of the acquisition. See Note 17 for further details regarding our Term Loan.
We integrated Marketo into our Digital Experience reportable segment and have included the financial results of Marketo
in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on the acquisition date. The amounts of net revenue and net loss of Marketo
included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from the acquisition date through November 30, 2018  were not material. The
direct transaction costs associated with the acquisition were also not material.
Purchase Price Allocation
Under the purchase accounting method, the total final purchase price was allocated to Marketo’s net tangible and intangible
assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.
The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to the acquired net tangible and intangible assets of Marketo
based on their estimated fair values as of October 31, 2018  and the associated estimated useful lives at that date. During fiscal
2019, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management’s estimates and assumptions in
regards to total purchase price, intangible assets, deferred revenue, tax liabilities assumed and their related impact to goodwill.

Identifiable intangible assets — Customer relationships consist of Marketo’s contractual relationships and customer loyalty
related to their enterprise and commercial customers as well as technology partner relationships. The estimated fair value of the
customer contracts and relationships was determined based on projected cash flows attributable to the asset. Purchased technology
acquired primarily consists of Marketo’s cloud-based engagement marketing software platform. The estimated fair value of the
purchased technology was determined based on the expected future cost savings resulting from ownership of the asset. Backlog
relates to subscription contracts and professional services. Non-compete agreements include agreements with key Marketo
employees that preclude them from competing against Marketo for a period of two years from the acquisition date. Trademarks
include the Marketo trade name, which is well known in the marketing ecosystem. We amortize the fair value of these intangible
assets on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.
Goodwill — Approximately $3.46 billion  of goodwill has been allocated entirely to our Digital Experience reportable
segment. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying acquired net tangible and
intangible assets. The factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill included securing buyer-specific synergies that increase
revenue and profits and are not otherwise available to a marketplace participant, acquiring a talented workforce and cost savings
opportunities. 
Net liabilities assumed — Marketo’s tangible assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2018 were reviewed and adjusted to
their fair value as necessary. The net liabilities assumed included, among other items,  $102.6 million  in accrued expenses, $74.8
million  in deferred revenue and $182.6 million  in deferred tax liabilities, which were partially offset by $54.9 million  in cash and
cash equivalents and $71.6 million  in trade receivables acquired.
Deferred revenue — Included in net liabilities assumed is Marketo’s deferred revenue which represents advance payments
from customers related to subscription contracts and professional services. We estimated our obligation related to the deferredTable of Contents

revenue using the cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the direct and indirect
costs related to supporting the obligation plus an assumed operating margin. The sum of the costs and assumed operating profit
approximates, in theory, the amount that Marketo would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation. The estimated
costs to fulfill the obligation were based on the near-term projected cost structure for subscription and professional services. As a
result, we recorded an adjustment to reduce Marketo’s carrying value of deferred revenue to $74.8 million , which represents our
estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed.
Taxes — As part of our accounting for the Marketo acquisition, a portion of the overall purchase price was allocated to
goodwill and acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax
purposes. Thus, approximately $348.8 million , included in the net liabilities assumed, was established as a deferred tax liability
for the future amortization of the intangible assets, and was partially offset by other tax assets of $166.2 million , which primarily
consist of net operating loss carryforwards.
Any impairment charges made in the future associated with goodwill will not be tax deductible and will result in an increased
effective income tax rate in the quarter the impairment is recorded.

Cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid debt investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date
of purchase. We classify our investments in marketable debt securities as “available-for-sale.” We carry these investments at fair
value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and recognized when
realized in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value
has occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income.

We review our debt securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not any security
has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. We consider factors such as the length of time and extent to which
the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and our intent to sell, or
whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost
basis. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of these securities, we write down these investments to fair
value. The portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive
income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal
2019 , 2018  and 2017 , we did not consider any of our investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Table of Contents

Our fixed income available-for-sale debt securities consist of high quality, investment grade securities from diverse issuers
with a weighted average credit rating of A+. We value these securities based on pricing from independent pricing vendors who
use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that model information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly in determining
fair value, including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We
therefore classify all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing
prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded. 
The fair values of our money market mutual funds and time deposits are based on the closing price of these assets as of the
reporting date. We classify our money market mutual funds and time deposits as Level 1. 
Our Level 2 over-the-counter foreign currency, Treasury lock and interest rate swap derivatives are valued using pricing
models and discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement
date.
Our deferred compensation plan assets consist of money market mutual funds and other mutual funds.Table of Contents

83NOTE 6.  DERIV ATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future
cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.
We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of
transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master
netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral
when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. 
Cash Flow Hedges
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use
foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue.
These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months . As of November 29, 2019 , total
notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion , hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds
and Japanese Yen.
In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion  Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million  notes payable
due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S.
Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion  of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the
impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our anticipated
refinancing. Upon refinancing and termination of the derivative instruments, their fair value will be amortized over the term of
our new debt to interest expense.
To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge,
and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in
fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until
the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the
foreign currency and Treasury lock cash flow hedges to revenue and interest expense, respectively. In the event the underlying
forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related
cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the same income statement line item as the hedged item.
If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value
from period to period are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item. 
We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively, and on an ongoing basis both retrospectively
and prospectively. We record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our
Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain or loss recognized in interest and other income (expense), net due to hedge
ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented.
Effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, all changes in fair value of our foreign currency cash flow hedges are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Prior to this, we recorded the time value of purchased contracts in interest and
other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The impact of the de-designation of our hedges due to the
change in methodology in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was immaterial.
For fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , there were no net gains or losses recognized in income relating to hedges of forecasted
transactions that did not occur. 
Fair Value Hedges
During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our
$900 million  of 4.75%  fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps
convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).
Under the terms of the swaps, we pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the
$900 million  notional amount through February 1, 2020. In exchange, we receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest from the swap
counterparties. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.
The interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged
portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in interest rate. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements
of Income. As of November 29, 2019 , the fair value of the interest rate swaps is recognized in accrued expenses on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets with a corresponding offset to current debt.
Non-Designated Hedges
Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use
to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The changes in fair value of these contracts is
recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the
underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related
contracts.
As of November 29, 2019 , total notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $702.4 million ,
primarily hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Indian Rupees. As of November 30, 2018 ,
total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $427.9 million , primarily hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British
Pounds, Japanese Yen and Indian Rupees. At November 29, 2019  and November 30, 2018 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging
derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.

U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed
existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing
a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act
reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal
statutory tax rate was 22.2% . This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced
tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on
deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5%  for foreign cash and certain other net current
assets, and 8% on the remaining income, in each case reduced by certain foreign tax credits. The Tax Act also included a provision
to tax global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income
and a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure that may tax certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its subsidiaries. These
additional provisions of the Tax Act were effective for us beginning December 1, 2018.
During fiscal 2018, we recorded tax charges for the impact of the Tax Act using the current available information and
technical guidance on the interpretations of the Tax Act. The accounting analysis was finalized based on the guidance, interpretations
and data available as of November 30, 2018. 
Certain international provisions introduced in the Tax Act are effective for us starting in fiscal 2019. As part of these
provisions, an accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of certain taxes in the period that is subject
to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We
elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that it is subject to such tax.
Reconciliation of Provision for Income Taxes 
Total income tax expense differs from the expected tax expense (computed by multiplying the U.S. federal statutory rate
of 21% in 2019, 22.2%  in 2018 and 35% in 2017 by income before income taxes) as a result of the following:

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
The tax effects of the temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of November 29, 2019  and November 30, 2018  are presented below:

Total deferred tax liabilities 587,766 559,189
Net deferred tax liabilities $ 140,498 $ 46,702
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Included in the
deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2019  and 2018  are amounts related to various acquisitions. In assessing the realizability
of deferred tax assets, management determined that it is not more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in
certain states and foreign jurisdictions to fully utilize available tax credits and other attributes. The deferred tax assets are offset
by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.
We provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered
permanently reinvested outside the United States or are exempted from taxation as a result of the new territorial tax system. To
the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may
be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of November 29, 2019 , the cumulative amount of foreign
earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided, and the corresponding unrecognized deferred tax liability, is not
material. 
As of November 29, 2019 , we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $421.6 million  for federal, $374.5
million  for state and $82.6 million  for foreign. We also have federal, state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$44.4 million , $243.8 million  and $15.1 million , respectively. The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire
in various years from fiscal 2020  through 2038 . The majority of the state tax credit carryforwards and a portion of the federal net
operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The net operating loss carryforward assets and certain credits are
reduced by the valuation allowance and are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The carrying
amount of such assets and credits is expected to be fully realized.
As of November 29, 2019 , a valuation allowance of $244.4 million  has been established for certain deferred tax assets
related to certain federal, state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2019 , the total change in the valuation allowance was $69.9 million .Table of Contents

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

as follows:
 (in thousands) 2019 2018
Beginning balance $ 196,152 $ 172,945
Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions 14,850 16,191

Settlements with taxing authorities (230) —
Lapse of statute of limitations (49,813 ) (45,922 )
Foreign exchange gains and losses (987) (3,783 )
Ending balance $ 173,337 $ 196,152
The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately
$25.1 million  and $24.6 million  for fiscal 2019  and 2018 , respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes
payable in their respective years.
We file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are
subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic
and foreign tax authorities. Our major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and
the United States, the earliest fiscal years open for examination are 2008 , 2015  and 2016 , respectively. We regularly assess the
likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have
reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however,
there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating
results and financial position.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our
tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude
or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above,
we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to
approximately $20 million . Table of Contents

91NOTE 11.  BENEFIT PLANS
Retirement Savings Plan
In 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is
a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe Inc. 401(k) Retirement
Savings Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the IRS
annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2019 , we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. We contributed
$51.7 million , $41.0 million  and $34.3 million  in fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively. We are under no obligation to continue
matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.
Deferred Compensation Plan
On September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, effective December 2,
2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, deferred compensation
arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a portion of their annual
compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100%  of other specified compensation,
including commissions, bonuses, performance awards, time-based restricted stock units and directors’ fees. Participants are able
to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan year in which election is
made or vests. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in cash and in the form of a lump sum, or five, ten, or fifteen-
year annual installments. For stock benefit elections, distributions are settled in stock and in the form of a lump sum payment only.
Beginning January 1, 2020, our updated Deferred Compensation Plan will no longer allow participants, except our Board of
Directors, to make stock benefit elections.
As of November 29, 2019  and November 30, 2018 , the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan total $93.8
million  and $69.0 million , respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 29,
2019  and November 30, 2018 , $108.8 million  and $84.0 million , respectively, were recorded as long-term liabilities to recognize
undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.Table of Contents

92NOTE 12.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Our stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide
incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-
based compensation plans and programs:
Restricted Stock Units
Prior to April 2019, we granted restricted stock units and performance awards to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity
Incentive Plan, as amended (“2003 Plan”). In April 2019, our stockholders approved the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”)
which replaced the 2003 Plan.
Beginning January 2019, restricted stock units granted as part of our annual review process or for promotions vest over
four years. Restricted stock units granted as part of our annual review process or for promotions with grant dates prior to January
2019 continue to vest over three years. Restricted stock units granted to new hires generally vest over four years. Certain grants
have other vesting periods approved by our Board of Directors or an authorized committee. We grant performance awards to
officers and key employees which cliff-vest after three years. 
As of November 29, 2019 , we had reserved 46.0 million  shares of common stock for issuance under our 2019 Plan and had
44.1 million  shares available for grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common
stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of a twenty-four-month offering period with four six-month
purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our
common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. The ESPP
will continue until the earlier of termination by the Board of Directors or the date on which all of the shares available for issuance
under the plan have been issued.
As of November 29, 2019 , we had reserved 93.0 million  shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP and
approximately 3.8 million  shares remain available for future issuance.
Performance Share Programs
Our 2019 , 2018  and 2017  Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value,
provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the ability of the Company to
attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors
approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology, under the terms of
our 2003 Plan. Shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a
three-year performance period. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest upon the later of the Executive
Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement or the three-year anniversary of each grant. Program
participants generally have the ability to receive up to 200%  of the target number of shares originally granted.
On January 24, 2018, the Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2019  Performance Share Program, the terms
of which are similar to prior year performance share programs as discussed above. 
As of November 29, 2019 , the shares awarded under our 2019 , 2018  and 2017  Performance Share Programs remain
outstanding and are yet to be achieved.
Issuance of Shares
Upon vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, purchases of shares under the ESPP and exercise of stock
options, we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the
impact of on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, we
instituted a stock repurchase program. See Note 14 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.
Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. 
Our performance share awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards are fixed at
grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. 
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP shares. The determination of the fair
value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility
over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and
any expected dividends.
The expected term of ESPP shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period. The
assumptions used to value employee stock purchase rights were as follows:
2019 2018 2017
Expected life (in years) 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0
V olatility 30% - 35% 26% - 29% 22% - 27%
Risk free interest rate 1.78% - 2.47% 1.54% - 2.52% 0.62% - 1.41%

Summary of Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares
The weighted average subscription date fair value of shares under the ESPP during fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were $72.98 ,
$53.12  and $29.86 , respectively. Employees purchased 1.5 million  shares at an average price of $150.55 , 1.8 million  shares at an
average price of $104.94 , and 1.9 million  shares at an average price of $77.63  for fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively. The
intrinsic value of shares purchased during fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017  was $178.8 million , $198.9 million  and $97.7 million ,
respectively. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market value on the date of purchase and the purchase
price of the shares.
Grants to Executive Officers
All equity awards granted to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Grants to Non-Employee Directors  
Although the 2003 and 2019 Plans provide for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-
employee directors, restricted stock units are the primary form of our grants to non-employee directors. The initial equity grant
to new non-employee directors and annual equity grants to existing non-employee directors are restricted stock unit awards, each
grant having an aggregate value of $0.3 million  based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day
before the date of grant and vest 100%  on the day preceding the next annual meeting. The actual target grant value of initial equity
grants will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before the next annual meeting or the date of the first anniversary
of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled. 
Restricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were as follows:

Initial equity grants to new directors 1 1 —
Compensation Costs
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is
based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
We also recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line
basis over the requisite performance period or service period of the entire award, whichever is longer. Our performance share
awards are earned upon achievement of an objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year performance
period, as described above.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards
that are expected to vest.
As of November 29, 2019 , there was $1.36 billion  of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures,
related to non-vested stock-based awards and purchase rights which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9
years. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. Table of Contents

97NOTE 14.  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May
2018, our Board of Directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to  $8 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal
2021. 
During fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.75 billion , $2.05 billion , and $1.10 billion , respectively.
We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the V olume Weighted
Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the
discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no
explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the
financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon
discount. We repurchased approximately 9.9 million  shares at an average price of $270.23  per share in fiscal 2019 , 8.7 million
shares at an average price of $230.43  per share in fiscal 2018 , and 8.2 million  shares at an average price of $134.20  per share in
fiscal 2017 . 
For fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 29, 2019 , November 30, 2018  and December 1,
2017  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 29, 2019 , $229.2 million  of prepayments remained
under the agreement. 
Subsequent to November 29, 2019 , we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution
whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $850 million . This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $850 million  stock repurchase agreement, $4.25 billion  remains under our
May 2018 authority. 
NOTE 15.  NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period,
excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, purchase
rights, performance awards and stock options using the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 :

 Lease Commitments
We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire
at various dates through 2031 . We also have one land lease that expires in 2091 . Rent expense includes base contractual rent and
variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was
approximately $170.5 million ,  $137.2 million  and $115.4 million  in fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively. Our sublease income
was immaterial for all periods presented.
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

Total $ 2,036,494 $ 738,692 $ 27,212
Royalties
We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally
based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost
of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $153.7 million , $119.1 million  and $100.9 million  in
fiscal 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively.
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against
claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we
are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification
provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions
on our future results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for
certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director
and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We
believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.
Legal Proceedings
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including
patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation.
Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the
attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past
litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes
could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent
us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products
or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification
commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our
independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations,
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.Table of Contents

In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter-
claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims.Table of Contents

Total carrying value of debt $ 4,138,267 $ 4,124,800
Term Loan Credit Agreement
In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for an up to $2.25 billion  senior unsecured term loan for the
purpose of partially funding the purchase price for our acquisition of Marketo and the related fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the acquisition. The Term Loan funds were received on October 31, 2018 upon closing of the acquisition and will
mature 18 months  following the initial funding date. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $0.7 million  which are amortized
to interest expense over the term using the straight-line method. The Term Loan ranks equally with our other unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness. There are no scheduled principal amortization payments prior to maturity and the Term Loan may
be prepaid and terminated at our election at any time without penalty or premium. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest
at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500%  to 1.000%  or (ii) a base rate plus a margin,
based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110% . Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest
period we elect. During fiscal 2019 , we made interest payments on our Term Loan totaling $69.9 million . The Term Loan credit
agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and
indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders similar to those contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement, including the
financial covenant. As of November 29, 2019 , we were in compliance with all covenants. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019,
we reclassified the Term Loan as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 29, 2019 , the carrying value
of the Term Loan was $2.25 billion  which is net of debt issuance costs. We intend to refinance the Term Loan on or before the
due date.
Senior Notes
In February 2010, we issued $900 million  of 4.75%  senior notes due February 1, 2020 . Our proceeds were approximately
$894.5 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million . Both
the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest
method. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in
arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010 . 
In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million  designated as a fair value
hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating
interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate
plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest
from the swap counterparties. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is included in the carrying value of our debt in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See Note 6 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives.
In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of
$7.9 million . Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using
the effective interest method. The effective interest rate including the discount, issuance costs and interest rate agreement is 3.67% .
Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2015 . 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the 2020 Notes as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of November 29, 2019 , the carrying value of the 2020 Notes was $899.6 million  which includes the fair value of the interest
rate swap and is net of debt issuance costs. We intend to refinance the 2020 Notes on or before the due date. 
As of November 29, 2019 , our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes (the “Notes”) with a
total carrying value of $1.89 billion , which includes the fair value of the interest rate swaps and is net of debt issuance costs. Based
on quoted prices in inactive markets, the fair value of the Notes was $1.96 billion  as of November 29, 2019 . 
The Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the Notes at any time,
subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be
required to repurchase the Notes, at a price equal to 101%  of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date
of repurchase. The Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on assets and to enter into sale and leaseback
transactions, subject to significant allowances. As of November 29, 2019 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants.
During fiscal 2019 , we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2020 and 2025 Notes totaling $75.3 million .
In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our Term Loan and 2020 Notes, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with
large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion  of our future
debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments
and will be terminated upon debt issuance. These derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges. See Note 6 for
further details regarding our Treasury lock agreements.
Revolving Credit Agreement
In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), providing for a five-year $1 billion
senior unsecured revolving credit facility and incurred issuance costs of $0.8 million  which are amortized to interest expense over
the term using the straight-line method. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for loans to Adobe and certain of its subsidiaries
that may be designated from time to time as additional borrowers. Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we
may, subject to the agreement of lenders to provide additional commitments, obtain up to an additional $500 million  in commitments,
for a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion . At our election, loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear
interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.585%  to 1.015%  or (ii) a base rate, which is
defined as the highest of (a) the agent’s prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500%  or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%  plus
a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.000%  to 0.015% . In addition, facility fees determined according to our debt
ratings are payable on the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage, quarterly in an amount ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110%
per annum. We are permitted to permanently reduce the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any
time. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, Adobe and any of its subsidiaries designated as
additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants,
including a financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants
include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions
and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to
exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Table of Contents

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Adobe Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adobe Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of November
29, 2019 and November 30, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended November 29, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the
consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of November
29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended November 29, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
November 29, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue
from contracts with customers and sales commissions as of December 1, 2018, due to the adoption of Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  and Subtopic
340-40,  Other Assets and Deferred Costs -  Contracts with Customers .
Basis for Opinions 
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting under item 9A. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonableTable of Contents
104
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Assessment of performance obligations in cloud-enabled software subscriptions
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and
interrelated with on-premise or on-device software licenses in the Company’s Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
subscription offerings. Because of this, the cloud-based services and the on-premise/on-device software licenses are not
considered distinct from each other and the applicable subscription is accounted for as a single performance obligation. 
We identified the assessment of performance obligations in these cloud-enabled software subscription offerings as a
critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the nature of the Company’s
Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, their intended benefit to customers as an integrated offering, and the level
of integration that exists between the cloud-enabled services and the on-premise/on-device licenses. 
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain
internal controls over the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls related to the assessment of distinct
performance obligations. We read the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offering agreements to understand
the contractual terms and conditions. We participated in product demonstrations, examined marketing materials, and
performed interviews with the Company’s product and engineering department to both understand and observe specific
functionalities of the integrated offering and evaluate the nature of the promise made to the Company’s Creative Cloud
and Document Cloud customers. We evaluated the features and functionalities of the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
subscription that can be accessed only when using the on-premise/on-device software while connected to the Adobe cloud
to assess that customers receive the intended benefit from each solution only as an integrated offering.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE

106ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 29, 2019 . Based on their evaluation
as of November 29, 2019 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were
effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal controls over financial reporting as of November 29, 2019 . In making this assessment, our management used the
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Our management has concluded that, as of November 29, 2019 , our internal controls over financial
reporting is effective based on these criteria.
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
On December 1, 2018, we implemented new and modified existing internal controls based on the adoption of the new
revenue standard. This resulted in changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and underlying control activities,
including our information systems. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter
ended November 29, 2019  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over
financial reporting.
