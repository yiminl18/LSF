PART I
Item 1—Business
Costco
 Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. We are principallyengaged
 in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan,Australia,
 Spain,  and through  majority-owned  subsidiaries  in Taiwan and Korea.  Costco  operated 715 , 686, and 663 warehouses worldwide atAugust
 28, 2016, August 30, 2015, and August 31, 2014, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under thesymbol “COST.”
We report on a
 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen, four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first threequarters
 consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). Thematerial
 seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2016,2015, and 2014 relate to the 52-week fiscal years en
ded August 28, 2016, August 30, 2015, and August 31, 2014, respectively.General
We
 operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded andprivate-label products in a wide range
 of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined withthe
 operating  efficiencies  achieved  by  volume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-servicewarehouse
 facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandisecosts)
 than most other retailers.  We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early paymentdiscounts
 when  available.  To  the  extent  that  sales  increase  and  inventory  turnover  becomes  more  rapid,  more  inventory  is  financed  throughpayment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital.
We
 buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  a  cross-docking  consolidation  point  (depot)  or  directly  to  ourwarehouses.
 Our  depots  receive  large  shipments  from  manufacturers  and  quickly  ship  these  goods  to  our  individual  warehouses.  This  processmaximizes freight volume and handling effici
encies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.3

Table of ContentsItem 1—Business (Continued)
Our
 average warehouse space is approximately 144,000 square feet, with newer units slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy andefficiency
 in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by thequality
 of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of ourwarehouses
 and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to amounts well below those of typical discount retailoperations.
Marketing
 activities  for  new  locations  generally  include  community  outreach  to  local  businesses  in  new  and  existing  markets  and  direct  mail  toprospective
 new members. Ongoing promotional programs primarily relate to coupon mailers, The Costco Connection (a magazine we publish forour members), and promotional e-mails to members.
Our
 warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours ofoperation
 are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to thevolume
 of  sales.  Merchandise  is  generally  stored  on  racks  above  the  sales  floor  and  displayed  on  pallets  containing  large  quantities,  therebyreducing
 labor  required.  In  general,  with  variations  by  country,  our  warehouses  accept  certain  debit  and  credit  cards,  co-branded  Costco  creditcards, cash, or checks.
Our
 strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere.We
 seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 activestock
 keeping  units  (SKUs)  per  warehouse  in  our  core  warehouse  business,  significantly  less  than  other  broadline  retailers.  Many  consumableproducts are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In
 keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day
 return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverageis sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise in the following categories:
•
Foods (including dry foods, packaged foods, and groc eries)•
Sundries (including snack foods , candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies)•
Hardlines (including major applianc es, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)•
Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) •
Softlines (including apparel and s mall appliances)•
Other (including gas stations and pharmacy) Ancillary
 businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently.We
 sell gasoline in all countries except Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan and operated 508, 472, and 445 gas stations at the end of 2016, 2015, and2014, respectively. Ancillary business
es also include optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers.Our
 online  businesses,  which  include e-commerce,  business  delivery,  and  travel,  operate  websites  in  all countries  except  Japan,  Australia,  andSpain.
 They provide our members additional products and services, typically not found in our warehouses. Net sales for our online business wereapproximately 4% of our net sales in 2016 and 3% in 2
015 and 2014, respectively.We
 have  direct  buying  relationships  with  many  producers  of  national  brand-name  merchandise.  We  do  not  obtain  a  significant  portion  ofmerchandi
se from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that ifone or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we w
ould be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of4

Table of ContentsItem 1—Business (Continued)
our
 business. We also purchase private label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our membersis greater as compared to brand-name items.
Certain
 financial  information  for  our  segments  and  geographic  areas  is  included  in  Note  11  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  inItem 8 of this Report.
Membership
Our
 members may utilize their memberships at any of our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Businessmemberships
 are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence.Business
 members have the ability to add additional cardholders (add-ons). Add-ons are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee forthese
 memberships is $55 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies by country in our Other International operations. All paid membershipsinclude a free household card.
Our
 member renewal rate was 90% in  the U.S. and Canada, and 88% on  a worldwide basis in 2016 .  The majority of members renew within sixmonths
 following their renewal date. Therefore, our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteenmonths prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):
 
2016   2015   2014 Gold Star
36,800   34,000   31,600 Business, including add-ons
10,800   10,600   10,400      Total paid members
47,600   44,600   42,000 Household cards
39,100   36,700   34,400 Total cardholders
86,700   81,300   76,400 Paid cardholders are eligib
le to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $55, and in Mexico andthe U.K.,
 for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $750per year in
 our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in our Other International operations), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses.This
 program also offers (except in Mexico) additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and homeinsurance,
 the Costco auto purchase program and check printing services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by stateand
 country. Executive members represented 39% of  paid cardholders at the end of 2016 , 2015 ,  and 2014 .  Executive members generally spendmore
 than other members, and where executive memberships are offered the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continuesto increase.
Labor
Our employee count was as follows:
 
2016   2015   2014 Full-time employees
126,000   117,000   112,000 Part-time employees
92,000   88,000   83,000 Total employees
218,000   205,000   195,000 Approximately 
15,000 employees,  in a minority of our locations, are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. We consider ouremployee relations to be very good.

Competition
Our
 industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, and customer service. We competeon
 a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialtystores,
 gasoline stations, internet retailers, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Competitors such as Wal-Mart,Target,
 Kroger,  and  Amazon.com  are  among  our  significant  general  merchandise  retail  competitors.  We  also  compete  with  warehouse  cluboperations (primarily Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesa
le Club), and nearly every major U.S. metropolitan area has multiple club operations.Intellectual Property
We
 believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domainnames
 and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in thedevelopment
 and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale ® series  of  trademarks  and  our  private  label  brand,Kirkland
 Signature. ® We believe that Kirkland Signature products are premium products, offered to our members at prices that are generally lowerthan
 those  for  similar  national  brand  products  and  that  they  help  lower  costs,  differentiate  our  merchandise  offerings  from  other  retailers,  andgenerally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to incre
ase the sales penetration of our private label items.We
 rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employeesand
 others to protect our intellectual property rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarksare generally valid and may be renew
ed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.Available Information

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors
The
 risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not theonly
 risks that we face. We could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well asother
 risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed inconjunction with Management 
'  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item    7 and our consolidated financialstatements and related notes in Item 
   8 of this Report.Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our
 financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 84% of net salesand operating income in 2016, respectively. Within 
the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 31% of U.S. netsales in
 2016. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets.Any
 substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines infinancial
 performance  of  our U.S.  operations,  particularly  in California,  and our Canadian operations  could arise  from,  among  other  things:  slowgrowth or declines in
 comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcareand
 energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix towardlower
 gross  margin  products;  changes  or  uncertainties  in  economic  conditions  in  our  markets,  including  higher  levels  of  unemployment  anddepressed
 home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member baseand attract new members.
We
 may  be  unsuccessful  implementing  our  growth  strategy,  including  expanding  our  business,  both  in  existing  markets  and  in  newmarkets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
 growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots. We compete with otherretailers
 and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehousesand
 depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local lawsrestricting
 our  operations  and  environmental  regulations,  may  impact  our  ability  to  find  suitable  locations,  and  increase  the  cost  of  sites  and  ofconstructing,
 leasing  and  operating  our  warehouses  and  depots.  We  also  may  have  difficulty  negotiating  leases  or  purchase  agreements  onacceptable
 terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation orexpansion
 plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. Failure to effectively manage these and othersimilar factors may
 affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect onour future growth and profitability.
We
 seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  overall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existingwarehouses and adversely affect comparable sa
les performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses.We
 also  intend  to  continue  to  open  warehouses  in  new  markets.  Associated  risks  include:  difficulties  in  attracting  members  due  to  a  lack  offamiliarity
 with  us,  attracting  members  of  other  wholesale  club  operators,  our  lack  of  familiarity  with  local  member  preferences,  and  seasonaldifferences
 in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with alarge,
 established market presence. We cannot ensure that our new warehouses and new websites will be profitably deployed and, as a result, ourfuture profitability could be delayed or otherwis
e materially adversely affected.8

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
Our failure to maintain membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.
Membership
 loyalty and growth are essential to our business model. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase thepenetration
 of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputationmay
 negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membershipfee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operatio
ns.In
 addition, we sell many products under our private label Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, andavailability
 of our  Kirkland Signature  products  for  our  members  is essential  to  developing and maintaining  member  loyalty.  These products  alsogenerally
 carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If theKirkland Signature brand experi
ences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.Disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.
We
 depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe thatour
 receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, earthquakes or othercatastrophic
 events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which couldadversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members.
We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, compile results, and manage our business. Failure or disruption of our
primary
 and back-up systems could adversely affect our business. A failure to adequately update our existing systems and implementnew systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.
Given
 the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-criticalcomputer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are
 subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer andtelecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal
 or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes andhurricanes, and errors by
 our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments tofix
 or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We
 are  currently  making,  and  will  continue  to  make,  significant  technology  investments  to  improve  or  replace  critical  information  systems  andprocessing.
 Failure  to  monitor  and  choose  the  right  investments  and  implement  them  at  the  right  pace  would  be  harmful.  The  risk  of  systemdisruption is increased when sig
nificant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate thisrisk.
 Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from thetechnology.
 Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above orbelow
 our  needs  could  result  in  the  loss  of  our  competitive  position  and  adversely  impact  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.Additio
nally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of ouroperations
 in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a highercost.

If
 we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and other business information, we could damage our reputation withmembers, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.

 service  providers  that  perform  activities  for  us.  Our  warehouse  and online businesses  depend upon the secure  transmission  of  encryptedconfident
ial information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those ofour
 business associates, that results in our members '  information being obtained by unauthorized persons, could adversely affect our reputationwith
 our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation againstus
 or  the  imposition  of  penalties.  In  addition,  a  breach  could  require  that  we  expend  significant  additional  resources  related  to  the  security  ofinformation systems and could disrupt our operations.
The
 use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries.   Privacy
 and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systemschanges
 and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations, ourreputation
 could  be  damaged,  possibly  resulting  in  lost  future  business,  and  we  could  be  subjected  to  additional  legal  risk  as  a  result  of  non-compliance.
Our
 security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise,and,
 as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because thetechniques
 used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable  or  degrade  service,  or  sabotage  systems  change  frequently  and  may  not  immediatelyproduce
 signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate preventativemeasures. Any such breach or unauthorized access coul
d result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentiallyhave an adverse effect on our business.
We are subject to payment-related risks.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash an
d checks, a select variety of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card.As
 we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraudlosses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other relate
d card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees.We
 rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards, and our proprietarycash
 card, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject topayment
 card association rules and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronicfunds
 transfers, which could change over time. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”), whichcontain
 compliance  guidelines  and  standards  with  regard  to  our  security  surrounding  the  physical  and  electronic  storage,  processing  andtransmission
 of individual cardholder data. As of October 1, 2015, the payment card industry shifted the liability of certain credit card transactions toretailers
 who are not able to process Europay, MasterCard, Visa (“EMV”) chip enabled card transactions. As a result, before our implementation ofthe EVM
 technology is complete, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks or other third parties for fraudulent transactionsinitiated
 through  EMV  chip  enabled  cards  before  our  implementation  of  EMV  chip  technology.  Implementation  of  the  EMV  chip  technology  andreceipt
 of  final  certification  is  subject  to  hardware  installation,  software  modification,  and  certification  with  our  third-party  transaction  serviceproviders.
 If we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment methods. Inaddition,
 if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transactionfees
 and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adverselyaffected.

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
We might sell unsafe products, resulting in illness or injury 
to our members, harm to our reputation, and litigation.If
 our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children '  s products, pet products, anddurable
 goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members '  expectations regarding safety, we couldexperience
 lost sales, increased costs, and legal and reputational losses. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injuryto our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauth
orized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including thepresence
 of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling andtransportation
 phases, or faulty design. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependenton
 them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations andwork
 to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will notcause
 a health-related illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to suchmatters
 resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a productliability
 claim  is  unsuccessful  or  is  not  fully  pursued,  related  negative  publicity  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  existing  and  potentialmembers and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be l
ong term.We
 may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members,the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It
 is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our abilityto
 identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumertastes,
 preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affectour
 relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our salestrends
 and  adjusting  our  purchases  accordingly,  we  may  have  excess  inventory,  which  could  result  in  additional  markdowns  and  reduce  ouroperating performance. This could have an adv
erse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.If
 we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could beadversely impacted.
Multichannel
 retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors.Our
 members, especially younger members, are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop and to interactwith us through social media. As part of
 our multichannel strategy, we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. Ifwe
 are  unable  to  make,  improve,  or  develop  relevant  member-facing  technology  in  a  timely  manner,  our  ability  to  compete  and  our  results  ofoperations could be adversely affected.
Inability
 to attract,  train and retain highly qualified  employees could adversely impact our business,  financial  condition  and results ofoperations.
Our
 success  depends  on  the  continued  contributions  of  members  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  operations,  merchandising  andadministrative
 personnel, and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We must attract, train and retaina
 large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control laborand
 benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurancecosts.
 We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them.There is
 no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial conditio
n and results of operations.11

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
Market and Other External Risks
We
 face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations.
The
 retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with awide
 range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouseclub operators, supermarkets,
 supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet retailers. Such retailers and warehouseclub
 operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours,and
 the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improvedthe
 ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financialresources,
 better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures,changes in the retail markets and member expectations could resu
lt in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.General
 economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  ofoperations.
Higher
 energy  and  gasoline  costs,  inflation,  levels  of  unemployment,  healthcare  costs,  consumer  debt  levels,  foreign-currency  exchange  rates,unsettled
 financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscaland tax policies, sovereign debt crises,
 and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a changein
 the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and aresubject
 to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  labor  costs,  competition,  market  speculation,government
 regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profitmargins. These
 factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affectour
 operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significantnational or international events.
Vendors
 may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our highstandards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We
 depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As these quantities continue to grow, wehave
 no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sellsto us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchan
dise leading to loss of sales and profits.We
 purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Ourinability
 to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to developrelations
hips with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existingvendors.
 Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, thelarge volume we demand may not be consistently ava
ilable.Our
 suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,financial
 liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their abilityto
 timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control,legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal w
elfare standards. These deficiencies12

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
may delay or
 preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure couldlead
 to  recalls  and  litigation,  and  otherwise  damage  our  reputation  and  our  brands,  increase  our  costs,  and  otherwise  adversely  impact  ourbusiness.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During
 2016, our  international  operations,  including Canada,  generated  27% and 39% of  our  net sales  and operating  income,  respectively.  Ourinternational
 operations  have  accounted  for  an  increasingly  larger  portion  of  our  warehouses  and  we  plan  to  continue  expanding  them.  Ouroperations
 in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statementsare denominated in
 U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the financial statements of our international operationsfrom
 local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. Future fluctuations in currency exchange rates over time that areunfavorable
 to  us  may  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  our  Canadian  and  Other  International  operating  segments  and  have  acorresponding
 adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuationsin foreign exchange rates may increase.
We
 may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country inwhich
 the  goods  will  be  sold.  Currency  fluctuations  may  increase  our  cost  of  goods  and  may  not  be  passed  on  to  members.  Consequently,fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural
 disasters,  such  as  hurricanes,  typhoons  or  earthquakes,  particularly  in  California  or  Washington  state,  where  our  centralized  operatingsystems
 and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result inphysical
 damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequatework
 force  in  a  market,  the  temporary  or  long-term  disruption  in  the  supply  of  products  from  some  local  or  overseas  suppliers,  the  temporarydisruption in the transport of
 goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which weoperate, and the temporary reduction in the availabi
lity of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad,could
 disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidencelevels.
 These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. We may berequired
 to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.
Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We
 use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Increased U.S. and foreign government andagency
 regulations  to  limit  carbon  dioxide  and  other  greenhouse  gas  emissions  may  result  in  increased  compliance  costs  and  legislation  orregulation
 affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure neededcommodities
 at  costs  and  in  quantities  we  currently  experience.  We  also  sell  a  substantial  amount  of  gasoline,  the  demand  for  which  could  beimpacted
 by  concerns  about  climate  change  and  which  also  could  face  increased  regulation.  Climate  change  may  be  associated  with  extremeweather
 conditions, such  as  more  intense  hurricanes,  thunderstorms,  tornadoes,  and  snow  or  ice  storms,  as  well  as  rising  sea  levels.  Extremeweather conditions increase our costs and resulti
ng damage to our properties may not be fully insured.13

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We
 believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay inmeeting
 these expectations, including our comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share,new warehouse openin
gs, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline.Legal and Regulatory Risks
Our
 international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economicfactors specific to the countrie
s or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.
During
 2016, we operated 214 warehouses in eight countries outside of the U.S. and we plan to continue expanding our international operations.Future
 operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain ofwhich are
 beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and othermatters
 in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations includeforeign
 trade, monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations,and
 risks  associated  with  having  major  facilities  located  in  countries  which  have  been  historically  less  stable  than  the  U.S.  Risks  inherent  ininternational
 operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, andgreater difficulty in enforcing intellectual prop
erty rights.Changes
 in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accountingmatters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting
 principles  and  related  pronouncements,  implementation  guidelines,  and  interpretations  we  apply  to  a  wide range  of  matters  that  arerelevant to
 our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, merchandise inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration,impairment
 of long-lived assets, self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimatesand judgments by
 our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments byour management could significantly cha
nge our reported or expected financial performance.Provisions
 for  losses  related  to  self-insured  risks  are  generally  based  upon  independent  actuarially  determined  estimates.  The  assumptionsunderlying
 the  ultimate  costs  of  existing  claim  losses  can  be  highly  unpredictable,  which  can  affect  the  liability  recorded  for  such  claims.  Forexample,
 variability in health care cost inflation rates inherent in these claims can affect the amounts recognized. Similarly, changes in legal trendsand
 interpretations, as well as changes in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates ofliabilities
 incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect uponfuture claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and co
uld materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.
We
 compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, achange
 in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.Additionally,
 changes  in  the  enacted  tax  rates,  adverse  outcomes  in  tax  audits,  including  transfer  pricing  disputes,  or  any  change  in  thepronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes co
uld have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.14

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
Significant
 changes in, or failure to comply with, federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,storage,
 discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters couldadversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
 are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge anddisposal
 of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws couldresult
 in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties orrestrictions on operations by governmental agenc
ies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We
 are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
Our
 business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  otherproceedings,
 and  lead  to  damage  awards,  fines,  penalties,  and  remediation  costs.  We  are,  or  may  become  involved,  in  a  number  of  legalproceedings
 and  audits  including  grand  jury  investigations,  government  and  agency  investigations,  and  consumer,  employment,  tort,  unclaimedproperty
 laws, and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item    8 ofthis Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedin
gs and other contingencies, including environmental remediationand
 other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws,and
 other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us topay
 substantial  amounts  of  money,  adversely  affecting  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Additionally,  defending  against  theselawsuits and proceedings may invo
lve significant expense and diversion of management '  s attention and resources.Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments

OVERVIEW
We
 believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales assales
 from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to websitesoperating
 for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing membersand
 the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyondour
 control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes inthe cost of gasoline and associated competitive co
nditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadian operations). The higher our comparable salesexclusive
 of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage ofsales
 and  enhancing  profitability.  Generating  comparable  sales  growth  is  foremost  a  question  of  making  available  to  our  members  the  rightmerchandise
 at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in salesgrowth
 is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted byour
 competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers. While we cannotcontrol
 or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting ourbusiness
 to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of ourprivate label items.
Our
 philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term onmaximizing
 prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  –consistently
 providing  the  most  competitive  values.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  can,  from  time  to  time,  include  reducing  prices  onmerchandise
 to  drive  sales  or  meet  competition  and  holding  prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on  to  ourmembers,
 all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasolinebusiness
 draws  members  but  it  generally  has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  non-gasoline  business.  A  higherpenetration
 of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term
 net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our grossmargin
 percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices hasthe inverse effect.
We
 also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become moredifficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial compo
nent of growth. The negative aspects of such growth,however,
 including  lower  initial  operating  profitability  relative  to  existing  warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  whenopenings
 occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growthis
 generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our online business growth bothdomestically and international
ly has also increased our sales.Our
 membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforcemember
 loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase penetration of ourExecutive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially i
nfluences our profitability.Our financial performance depends heavi
ly on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically,some
 significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to thecompensation of our employees, our philoso
phy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that20

(amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) 
(Continued) achieving
 our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levelsthat
 are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers mightseek
 to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the incomestatement, particularly merchandise costs and selling, gen
eral and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our
 operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidatedfinancial
 statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of squarefootage
 growth,  lower  wages  and  benefit  costs  as  a  percentage  of  country  sales,  and/or  less  or  no  direct  membership  warehouse  competition.Additionally, we operate our low
er-margin gasoline business in all countries except Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan.In
 discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which arereferences
 to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from localcurrencies
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the differencebetween
 the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on netsales is calculated based on the differenc
e between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 
2016 , 2015 and 2014 were 52-week fiscal years ending on August 28, 2016 , August
 30, 2015 and August 31, 2014 ,  respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unlessotherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
Highlights for fi
scal year 2016 included:•
We opened 29 net new warehouses in 2016, 21 in the U.S., two in Canada, and six in our Other International segment, compared to 23 netnew warehouses in 2015;
•
Net sales increased 2% to $116,073 , driven by sales  at new warehouses opened in 2015 and 2016, while comparable sales were flat. Net andcomparabl
e sales results were negatively impacted by changes in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreases in the priceof gasoline;
•
Membership  fee  revenue  increased  4%  to $2,646 ,  primarily  due  to  membership  sign-ups  at  existing  and  new  warehouses  and  executivemembership upgrades, partially offset by the negative impact of chang
es in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;•
Gross margin percentage increased 26 basis points, primarily from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales;•
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 basis points, largely driven by the impact ofgasoline price deflation
 on net sales;•
Net income decreased 1% to $2,350 ,  or $5.33 per diluted share compared to $2,377, or $5.37 per diluted share in 2015. The 2015 resultswere
 positively impacted by a $57 tax benefit, or $0.13 per diluted share, in connection with the special cash dividend paid to the Company's401(k) Plan participants;
•
Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.24, largely driven by changes inthe Canadian dollar and 
Mexican peso;•
In December 2015, we paid the outstanding principal balance and associated interest on the 0.65% Senior Notes of approximately $1,204,from our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments;
•
The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 per share in April 2016; and•
In June 2016, we transitioned to our new Citibank-Visa exclusive co-branded credit card in the U.S. (described in further detail in Item 9B ofthis Report).

Net Sales
Net sales increased 
$2,407 or 2% during 2016. This was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2015 and 2016. Comparable sales wereflat.
 Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,690, or 237 basis points, comparedto
 2015. The negative impact was attributable to most foreign countries in which we operate, predominantly Canada of $1,646, Mexico of $550, andUK
 of $224. Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,194, or 193 basis points, due to a 19% decrease in theaverage sales price per gallon.
Comparable Sales
Comparable
 sales were flat during 2016 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency offset by a decrease in the averageticket.
 The average ticket and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and adecrease

The
 increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades toour
 higher-fee Executive Membership program. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar,which negatively impacted membership fees by
 approximately $52 in 2016. At the end of 2016, our member renewal rates were 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 
88% worldwide. 2015 vs. 2014
Membership
 fees increased 4% in 2015. This increase was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increasednumber

The
 gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage ofcore merchandise sales (rather than
 total net sales), increased 13 basis points, primarily due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods.This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales p
enetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.Total
 gross margin percentage increased 26 basis points compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, grossmargin
 as  a  percentage  of  adjusted  net  sales  was  11.14%,  an  increase  of  five  basis  points.  A  larger  LIFO  benefit  in  2016  compared  to  2015positively
 contributed  three  basis  points.  The  LIFO  benefit  resulted  largely  from  lower  costs  for  merchandise  inventories,  primarily  in  food  andsundries and gasoline. Our core merchandise cate

 categories,  primarily  hardlines  and  softlines,  and  the  LIFO  benefit  discussed  above.  The  segment  gross  margin  percentage  in  ourCanadian
 operations decreased, primarily due to a decrease in all core merchandise categories, except hardlines, partially offset by increases inwarehouse

The
 gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage ofcore
 merchandise sales, increased five basis points, primarily due to increases in softlines and food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease infresh foods.
Our
 gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points compared to 2014 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasolineprice
 deflation on net sales. Excluding this impact, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.81%, an increase of 15 basis pointsfrom
 the prior year. This increase was predominantly due to: an increase in our warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of 23 basispoints,
 due primarily to our gasoline business; partially offset by a negative contribution from core merchandise categories of 12 basis points, as aresult
 of a decrease in their sales penetration. A LIFO benefit in 2015 compared to a charge in 2014 positively contributed five basis points. TheLIFO benefit resulted largely from lower costs of gasoline. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin
by approximately $359 in 2015.

SG&A expenses as a percentage of
 net sales increased 33 basis points compared to 2015. Excluding the negative impact of gasoline price deflationon
 net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 10.20%, an increase of 13 basis points. This was largely due to: highercentral
 operating costs of six basis points, predominantly due to costs associated with our information systems modernization, including increaseddepreciation
 for projects placed in service, incurred by our U.S. operations; and higher stock compensation expense of four basis points, due toappreciat
ion in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant. Our investment in modernizing our information systems is ongoing and expected tocontinue
 to  negatively  impact  SG&A  expenses.  Charges  for  non-recurring  legal  and  regulatory matters  during  2016  negatively  impacted  SG&Aexpenses
 by two basis points. Our warehouse operating costs were higher by one basis point due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs,primarily
 health  care,  i n  our  U.S.  operations.  This  increase  was  partially  offset  by  lower  payroll  expense  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales  in  ourCanadian

 expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 18 basis points, mostly due to the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales.Excluding
 this impact, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 9.82%, an improvement of seven basis points. This was due tolower
 warehouse operating costs of 16 basis points, primarily from improvements in payroll expenses in our core business as a result of leveragingincreased
 sales.  This  improvement  was  partially  offset  by  higher  central  operating  costs  of  five  basis  points,  predominantly  due  to  increaseddepreciation
 and service contract costs associated with our information systems modernization  projects that were placed into service during theyear,
 primarily incurred by our U.S. operations. Higher stock compensation expense also negatively impacted our SG&A expenses by four basispoints,
 due  to  an  appreciation  in  the  trading  price  of  our  stock  at  the  time  of  grant.  Changes  in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollardecreased our SG&A expenses by approximate

(2,345 )  (2,480 )  (2,093 ) Net cash used in financing activities
(2,419 )  (2,324 )  (786 )Our
 primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cashand
 cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  were $4,729 and $6,419 at  the  end  of  2016  and  2015,  respectively.  Of  these  balances,approximately
 $1,071  and  $1,243  at  the  end  of  2016  and  2015,  respectively,  represented  unsettled  credit  and  debit  card  receivables.  Thesereceivables generally settle within one week. Cash and
 cash equivalents were positively impacted by changes in exchange rates by $50 in 2016 andnegatively impacted by 
$418 and $11 in 2015 and 2014,  respectively.We
 have  not  provided  for  U.S.  deferred  taxes  on  cumulative  undistributed  earnings  of  certain  non-U.S.  consolidated  subsidiaries,  including  theremaining
 undistributed  earnings  of  our  Canadian  operations,  because  our  subsidiaries  have  invested  or  will  invest  the  undistributed  earningsindefinitely, or the earnings,

 repatriated would not result in an adverse tax consequence. Although we have historically asserted that certain non-U.S. undistributed earningswill
 be permanently reinvested, we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence. If we determinethat
 such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested,  deferred taxes, to the extent required and applicable, are recorded at that time. During2016, we
 repatriated the earnings in our Canadian operations that in 2015 were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Subsequent to the endof
 the fiscal year, we determined that a portion of the undistributed earnings in our Canadian operations could be repatriated without adverse taxconsequences. Accordingly, we no l
onger consider that portion to be indefinitely reinvested.Management
 believes  that  our  cash  position  and  operating  cash  flows  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  theforeseeable
 future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and have nocurrent
 plans  to  repatriate  for  use  in  the  U.S.  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  held  by  these  non-U.S.  consolidatedsubsidiaries
 whose  earnings  are  considered  indefinitely  reinvested.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  held  at  thesesubsidiaries with earnings cons
idered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled $1,535 at August 28, 2016.Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net
 cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,292 in  2016, compared to $4,285 in  2015. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarilyderived from
 net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouseoperating
 costs including payroll and employee benefits, credit and debit card processing fees, and utilities. Cash used in operations also includespayments
 for  income  taxes.  The  decrease  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  2016  when  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  due  toaccelerated vendor
 payments of approximately $1,700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016, in advance of implementing our modernized accountingsystem at the beginning of fiscal 2017.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net
 cash used in investing activities totaled $2,345 in  2016 compared to $2,480 in  2015. Cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related tofunding
 warehouse expansion and remodeling activities. Net  cash flows from investing activities also included purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditure Plans
We
 opened 29 new warehous es  and relocated four warehouses in 2016 and  plan to open up to 31 new warehouses and relocate up to threewarehouses
 in 2017.  Our  primary  requirement  for  capital  is acquiring  land,  buildings,  and equipment  for  new and remodeled  warehouses.  To alesser
 extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations, the modernization of our information systems, and working capital. In 2016 we spent
 $2,649  on  capital  expenditures,  and  it  is  our  current  intention  to  spend  approximately  $2,600  to  $2,800  during  fiscal 2017 . Theseexpendit
ures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. There can beno assurance that current expectations will be realiz
ed and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net
 cash used in financing activities totaled $2,419 in  2016 compared to $2,324 in  2015. The primary uses of cash in 2016 were related to the$1,200
 repayment  of  our  0.65%  Senior  Notes  in  December  2015,  dividend  payments  of $746 ,  repurchases  of common stock,  and payment  ofwithholding
 taxes on stock-based awards. Net cash used in financing activities in 2015 included a $5.00 per share special cash dividend, totalingapproximately $2,201, partially offset by the issuance of $1,00
0 in Senior Notes.27

 2016, our Japanese subsidiary issued approximately $93 of zero percent Guaranteed  Senior Notes through a private placement. Interest onboth issuances are payable semi-ann
ually, and principal is due in March 2026 and June 2021, respectively.Stock Repurchase Programs
During
 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 3,184,000 and 3,456,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $149.90 and $142.87, totalingapproximately
 $477 and $494, respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,222 at  the end of2016.
 Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SECRule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in acc
ordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.Dividends
Cash
 dividends paid in 2016 totaled $1.70  per share, as compared to $6.51 per share in 2015 ,  which included a special cash dividend of $5.00 pershare. In April 2016, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash divi
dend from $0.40 to $0.45 per share.Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We
 maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 28, 2016, we had borrowing capacity within thesefacilities
 of $429, of which $358 was maintained by our international operations. Of the $358, $177 is guaranteed by the Company. There were nooutstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the en
d of 2016 and 2015.The
 Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $153. The outstanding commitments under thesefacilitie
s at the end of 2016 totaled $96, including $94 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities havevarious
 expiration dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. The amount of borrowingsavailable at any time under our bank credit faciliti
es is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding.28

Operating lease obligations exclude amounts for common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $129 to reflect sub-lease income. (4)
Includes build-to-suit lease obligations and contractual interest payments. (5)
The  amounts  exclude  certain  services  negotiated  at  the  individual  warehouse  or  regional  level  that  are  not  significant  and  generally  contain  clauses  allowing  forcancellation without significant penalty.
(6)
Includes $64 in  asset  retirement  obligations,  and  $62  in  deferred  compensation  obligations.  The  total  amount  excludes  $51  of  non-current  unrecognized  taxcontingencies and $29 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current orfuture
 effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than the operating leases included in the table above and discussed in Note 1and Note 5 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report.Critical Accounting Estimates
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requiresthat
 we make estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-livedassets, insurance/self-insurance liabil
ities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe tobe
 reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these statements. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussionin Note 1 to the consolidated financia
l statements included in Item 8 of this Report.Revenue Recognition
We
 generally  recognize  sales,  which  include  shipping  fees  where  applicable,  net  of  returns,  at  the  time  the  member  takes  possession  ofmerchandise
 or receives services. When we collect payment from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance ofservices, the amount is generally
29

Table of ContentsItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) 
(Continued) recorded
 as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns basedon
 historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs accordingly. Our sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizablevalue of merchandise inventories to be returned. Amounts col
lected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a net basis.We
 evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount. Generally, when we arethe
 primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications,or
 have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess otherindicators
 of gross reporting as noted above, we record a net amount, which is reflected in net sales. We record related shipping fees on a grossbasis.
We
 account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executivemembers
 qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $750 per year in the U.S. and Canada andvaries
 in our Other International operations), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. We account for this reward as a reduction insales.
 The  sales  reduction  and  corresponding  liability  are  computed  after  giving  effect  to  the  estimated  impact  of  non-redemptions  based  onhistorical data.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise
 inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using thelast-in,
 first-out  (LIFO)  method for  substantially  all U.S.  merchandise inventories.  Merchandise inventories  for  all foreign  operations are primarilyvalued
 by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary,for
 the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. We believe the LIFOmethod more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues.
We
 provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted toreflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which genera
lly occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year.Inventory
 cost,  where  appropriate,  is  reduced  by  estimates  of  vendor  rebates  when  earned  or  as  we  progress  toward  earning  those  rebates,provided
 they  are  probable  and  reasonably  estimable.  Other  consideration  received  from  vendors  is  generally  recorded  as  a  reduction  ofmerchandise costs upon completion of contractual milesto
nes, terms of agreement, or other systematic approaches.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We
 evaluate  our  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  on  an  annual  basis,  when  relocating  or  closing  a  facility,  or  when  events  or  changes  incircumstanc
es occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. Ourjudgments
 are  based  on  existing  market  and  operational  conditions.  Future  events  could  cause  us  to  conclude  that  impairment  factors  exist,requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair value.
Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
We
 use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary andparticipation
 in a reinsurance program, to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ andofficers’
 liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and areestimated, in part, by
 considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimatedaccruals for these liabilities could be si
gnificantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.30

(amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) 
(Continued) Income Taxes
The
 determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application ofcomplex
 tax  laws.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the  timing  and  amounts  of  deductible  and  taxable  items  and  the  probability  ofsustaining
 uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements onlyafter
 determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstanceschange,
 we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Additionally, our cumulativeforeign
 undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested as of August 28, 2016. These earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax ifwe
 changed our position and could result in a U.S. deferred tax liability. Although we have historically asserted that certain non-U.S. undistributedearnings will be permanently reinv
ested, we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)
Our
 exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  inspeculative or leveraged transactions or hol
d or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk
Our
 exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instrumentsconsidered
 to be cash equivalents as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term
 investments  in  government  and  agency  securities,  and  asset  and  mortgage-backed  securities  with  effective  maturities  of  generally  threemonths
 to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generateyields.
 The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due tointerest rate fluctuations.
Our
 policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized byU.S.
 government  and  government  agency  obligations,  and  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  money  market  funds.  Our  wholly-ownedcaptive
 insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage-backed
 securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA+. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments areprimarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of dep
osit, generally denominated in local currencies.A
 100  basis-point  change  in  interest  rates  as  of  the  end  of 2016 would  have  an  incremental  change  in  fair  market  value  of  $22.  For  thoseinvestments
 that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates arereflected within stockholders’ equity in accumu
lated other comprehensive income.The
 nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of2016,
 the majority of our long-term debt is fixed rate Senior Notes, carried at $4,390 .  Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of thefixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.31

Table of ContentsItem 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)(Continued)
Foreign Currency-Exchange Risk
Our
 foreign  subsidiaries  conduct  certain  transactions  in  their  non-functional  currencies,  which  exposes  us  to  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates.  Wemanage
 these  fluctuations,  in  part,  through  the  use  of  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts,  seeking  to  economically  hedge  the  impact  of  thesefluctuations
 on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economicallyhedge
 exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other thanthe U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accou
nting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts anddo not intend to engage in specul
ative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features.We
 seek to  manage counterparty  risk  associated  with  these contracts  by limiting  transactions  to counterparties  with which we have establishedbanking
 relationships. There can be no assurance that this practice is effective. These contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 andNote
 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forwardforeign-exchange
 contracts  at  the  end  of 2016 and 2015 .  A  hypothetical  10%  strengthening  of  the  functional  currency  compared  to  the  non-functional
 currency exchange rates at August  28, 2016 would  have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $56 and resulted in an unrealizedloss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.
Commodity Price Risk
We
 are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigatethrough
 fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominately in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced
 contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meetthe
 characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidanceand require no mark-to-market adjustment.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
 of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  performed  an  evaluation  under  the  supervision  and  with  theparticipat
ion of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as definedin
 Rules  13a-15(e)  or  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Act  of  1934  (the  Exchange  Act)).  Based  upon  that  evaluation,  our  ChiefExecutive
 Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls andprocedures are effective.
There has
 been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during ourfiscal

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing a
nd maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe
 Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  includes  those  policies  andprocedures
 that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositionsof
 our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  withappropriate
 authorizations;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  ordisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financi
al statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systemsdetermined to be effective can provide only reasona
ble assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.Under the supervision and with the
 participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting asof 
August 28, 2016 ,  using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in InternalControl—Integrated
 Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting waseffective

In
 February 2015, we entered into a Co-Branded Credit Card Program Agreement (the “Program Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”). Under theterms
 of the Program Agreement, Citi became the exclusive issuer of our co-branded credit cards to our members. Additionally, Visa U.S.A. Inc.became
 the credit card network for Costco in the United States and Puerto Rico. Citi purchased the current co-branded credit card portfolio fromAmerican
 Express  in  June  2016.  On  June  20,  2016,  we  began  accepting  all  Visa  cards,  including  the  Citi  co-branded  credit  cards,  replacingAmerican
 Express.  We  receive  various  forms  of  consideration  under  the  Program  Agreement.  The initial  term  of  the  Program  Agreement  is tenyears.
Under the Program Agreement, Costco earns a royalty on purchases made with the
 co-branded card other than from Costco ("external spend"). Theroyalty
 varies  based  on  the  amount  of  external  spend  in  relation  to  total  spend.  In  addition,  Costco  will  fund  a  portion  of  the  loyalty  rewardcardholders
 earn under the program on external spend. Loyalty rewards under the program are as follows: 4% on eligible gasoline purchases, 3%on
 restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% on all purchases from Costco and Costco.com, and 1% on all other purchases. These rewards maybe
 adjusted over the term of the program. The loyalty rewards earned by co-branded cardholders will be in the form of certificates redeemable atCostco, for cash or merchandise. Costco also receives a bounty on approve
d new credit card accounts acquired through Costco34

BLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders
Costco Wholesale Corporation:
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August  28, 2016 and August 30, 2015 
, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods endedAugust
 28,  2016 , August  30,  2015 and August  31,  2014 .  These  consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’smanagement. Our responsibility is to express an opinio
n on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standardsrequire that we
 plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.An
 audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includesassessing
 the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statementpresentation. We believe that our audits provide a reaso
nable basis for our opinion.In
 our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  CostcoWholesale Corporation
 and subsidiaries as of August 28, 2016 and August 30, 2015 ,  and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the52-week periods ended 
August 28, 2016 , August 30, 2015 and August 31, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting princ iples.We

Costco Wholesale Corporation:
We
 have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of August  28, 2016 ,  based on criteria established inInternal
 Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). TheCompany’s
 management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectivenessof
 internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reportingincluded in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opin
ion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standardsrequire
 that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  wasmaintained
 in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk thata
 material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Ouraudit
 also  included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  areasonable basis for our opinion.
A
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  anyevaluation
 of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate.In
 our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August  28, 2016 ,  based oncriteria
 established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission(2013).
We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidatedbalance
 sheets of the Company as of August  28, 2016 and August 30, 2015 ,  and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensiveincome,
 equity, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August  28, 2016 , August 30, 2015 and August 31, 2014 ,  and our reportdated 
October 11, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion  on those consolidated financial statements./s/ KPMG LLP

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or
 the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based onthe
 concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandisecategories
 will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August  28, 2016 ,  Costco operated 715 warehouses worldwide: 501 United States (U.S.) locations (in 
44 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico), 91 Canada locations, 36 Mexico locations, 28 United Kingdom(U.K.)
 locations, 25 Japan locations, 12 Korea locations, 12 Taiwan locations, eight Australia  locations, and two Spain locations. The Company'sonline business operates we
bsites in all countries except Japan, Australia, and Spain.Basis of Presentation
The
 consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation,  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  and  subsidiaries  inwhich it
 has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from theCompany’s
 equity.  All  material  inter-company  transactions  between  and  among  the  Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  beeneliminated
 in  consolidation.  The  Company’s  net  income  excludes  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  in  its  operations  in  Taiwan  andKorea. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributa
ble to Costco.Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 
52/53 week fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending o n the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2016 , 2015, and 
2014 relate to the 52 -week fiscal years ended August 28, 2016 ,  August 30, 2015 , and August 31, 2014 , respectively. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. general
ly accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to makeestimates and assumptio
ns that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from thoseestimates and assumptions.
Reclassifications
Certain
 reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. Thesereclassifications did not have a material impact on the Comp
any’s previously reported consolidated financial statements.Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
 Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at thedate
 of  purchase,  and  proceeds  due  from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  with  settlement  terms  of  up  to  one  week.  Credit  and  debit  cardreceivables were $ 
1,071 and $ 1,243 at the end of 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Short-Term Investments
In
 general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond fiveyears may be classified, based on the Company’s determin
ation,46

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (Continued)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
as
 short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term
 investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains andlosses
 reflected  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  realized.  Realized  gains  and  losses  from  the  sale  of  available-for-salesecurities,
 if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statementsof
 income. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold tomaturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring b
asis.The
 Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative andquantitative
 criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the credit loss component ininterest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
 Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash andcash
 equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3,and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s inv
estments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.Fair
 value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer  a liability in an orderly transaction  between marketparticipants
 at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observableinputs when measuring fair value. The three leve
ls of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservab
le inputs that are corroborated by marketdata.
Level 3: Significant unobservab
le inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such asquoted net asset
 values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all othernon-derivative
 financial  instruments  are  based  on  independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  ofindependent
 external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves includingbut not limited to 
treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can bederived
 principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable,using the fair value of the individual sec
urities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.Current
 financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which isrecorded on the balance sheet at issuance pric
e and adjusted for any applicable unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs.47

Receivables, Net
Receivables consist of the followin
g at the end of 2016 and 2015 :  
2016   2015 Vendor receivables
$ 755  $729 Reinsurance receivables
270  273 Third-party pharmacy receivables
99  103 Other receivables, net
128  119 Receivables, net
$ 1,252  $1,224 Vendor
 receivables include volume rebates or other purchase discounts. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from anyrelated payable due.
 In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor. Reinsurance receivablesare
 held  by  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary.  The  balance  primarily  represents  amounts  ceded  through  reinsurancearrangements
 gross  of the amounts  assumed  under reinsurance,  which are presented  within other  current  liabilities in the consolidated  balancesheets.
 Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurance companies. Other receivables primarily consistof amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.
Receivables
 are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specificidentification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial for fiscal years 
2016 , 2015 , and 2014 . Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the followi
ng at the end of 2016 and 2015 :  
2016   2015 United States
$ 6,422  $6,427 Foreign
2,547  2,481 Merchandise inventories
$ 8,969  $8,908 Merchandise
 inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using thelast-in,
 first-out  (LIFO)  method for  substantially  all U.S.  merchandise inventories.  Merchandise inventories  for  all foreign  operations are primarilyvalued
 by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairlypresents the results of
 operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter,if
 necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, afteractual inflation rates and inventory levels for the year have b
een determined.Due
 to net deflationary trends, a benefit of $64 and $27 was recorded to merchandise costs in 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively. Due to net inflationarytrends
 in 2014 ,  a charge of $28 was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories. At theend of 
2016 and 2015 , the cumulative impact of the LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories w as immaterial and $ 82 , respectively.The
 Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based onthe Company’s experience. The provisio
n is adjusted periodically to reflect actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second andfourth
 fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progressestowards earning those rebates, provided that they are probab
le and reasonably estimable.48

Property and Equipment
Property and
 equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with its own estimated useful life,generally 
five to fifty years for buildings and improvements  and three to twenty years  for  equipment  and fixtures.  Depreciation  and amortizationexpense is computed using the straight-line metho
d over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after thebeginning
 of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial leaseplus any renewals that are reasonably assure
d at the date the leasehold improvements are made.The
 Company  capitalizes  certain  computer  software  and  software  development  costs  incurred  in  developing  or  obtaining  computer  software  forinternal
 use.  These  costs  are  included  in  equipment  and  fixtures  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  thesoftware, generally 
three to seven years. Repair
 and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or changethe
 way  an  asset  functions  or  that  extend  the  useful  life  are  capitalized.  Assets  that  were  removed  during  the  remodel,  refurbishment  orimprovement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 
2016 and 2015 were immaterial. The
 Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes incircumstances
 may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For assetgroups
 held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimatedfuture
 undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In theevent
 that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss would be recognized for the asset group to be held and used equalto
 the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group),the carrying value is
 compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisalsfrom
 third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2016 ,  and charges were immaterialand included in selli
ng, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income in 2015 and 2014 . Accounts Payable
The Company’s banking system provides for
 the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Included in accounts payableat the end of 
2016 and 2015 are $ 619 and $ 538 , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks onwhich
 the checks were drawn. The Company accelerated vendor payments of approximately $ 1,700 in  the last week of fiscal 2016 in advance ofimplementing its modernized accountin
g system at the beginning of fiscal 2017.Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
The
 Company  uses  a  combination  of  insurance  and  self-insurance  mechanisms,  including  for  certain  risks  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurancesubsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program,
 to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage,directors’
 and  officers’  liability,  vehicle  liability,  and  employee  health  care  benefits.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  are  retained  by  theCompany are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by consid
ering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and otheractuarial
 assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from theseassumptions
 and historical trends. At the end of 2016 and 2015 ,  these insurance liabilities were $ 1,021 and  $ 993 in the aggregate, respectively,and were included in accrued sa
laries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.49

The
 Company’s  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  receives  direct  premiums,  which  are  netted  against  the  Company’spremium
 costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsuranceprogram
 that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into byeach
 participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsuranceprogram
 limit any participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts tothe
 consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, theCompany is not relieved of its primary obligation to the pol
icyholders for activity prior to the termination of the annual agreement.Other Curren

2016 and 2015 :  
2016   2015 Accrued sales, income, and other taxes

137  124 Other
314  185 Other current liabilities
$ 2,003  $1,695 Derivatives
The
 Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,through
 the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on knownfuture
 expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventoryexpenditures
 made by the Company’s international subsidiaries, with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts donot
 qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage inspeculative
 transactions.  These  contracts  do  not  contain  any  credit-risk-related  contingent  features.  The  aggregate  notional  amounts  of  open,unsettled
 forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 572 and $ 889 at the end of 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively. The Company seeks to managecounterparty
 risk  associated  with these  contracts  by limiting  transactions  to counterparties  with which the  Company has an established  bankingrelationship.
 There can be no assurance that this practice is effective. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 forinformation on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchan
ge contracts at the end of 2016 and 2015 . The
 unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to thenet changes in
 the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2016 and 2014 , respectively, and a  net gain of $12 in 
2015 . The
 Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  the  energy  it  consumes,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  which  it  seeks  to  partiallymitigate
 through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Companyalso
 enters  into  variable-priced  contracts  for  some  purchases  of  natural  gas,  in  addition  to  fuel  for  its  gas  stations,  on  an  index  basis.  Thesecontracts
 meet  the  characteristics  of  derivative  instruments,  but  generally  qualify  for  the  “normal  purchases  or  normal  sales”  exception  underauthoritative guidance and requ
ire no mark-to-market adjustment.50

Foreign Currency
The
 functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assetsand
 liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded inaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company’s  consolidated  foreign  operations  are  translated  at  averageexchange rates pre
vailing during the year.The
 Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin currencies other than the functional currency in interest income an
d other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally,these
 include  the  U.S.  dollar  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  the  U.S.  dollar  payables  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  revalued  to  their  functionalcurrency.
 Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items resultedin net gains of 
$38 , $35 , and $25 for 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. Revenue Recognition
The
 Company generally recognizes sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession ofmerchandise
 or receives services. When the Company collects payments from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or theperformance
 of  services,  the  amounts  received  are  generally  recorded  as  deferred  sales,  included  in  other  current  liabilities  in  the  consolidatedbalance sheets,
 until the sale or service is completed. The Company reserves for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandisereturns
 and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value ofmerchandise inventories to be returned. Amounts collecte
d from members for sales or value added taxes are recorded on a net basis.The
 Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned.Generally,
 when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influenceproduct
 or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not theprimary obligor and does not
 possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts earned, which is reflected in netsales. The Company records related shippin
g fees on a gross basis.The
 Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  revenue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  over  the  one-year  membership  period.  TheCompany's
 Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $ 750 per year), whichcan
 be  redeemed  only  at  Costco  warehouses.  The  Company  accounts  for  this  reward  as  a  reduction  in  sales.  The  sales  reduction  andcorresponding
 liability (classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets) are computed after giving effect to the estimatedimpact
 of non-redemptions based on historical data. The net reduction in sales was $ 1,172 ,  $ 1,128 ,  and $ 1,051 in 2016 , 2015 ,  and 2014 , respectively.
Merchandise Costs
Merchandise
 costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’sdepot
 operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also includesalaries, benefits, depreciation, and utiliti
es in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.Vendor Consideration
The Company has agreements with
 vendors to receive funds for volume rebates and a variety of other programs. Volume rebates or other purchasediscounts are evidenced by signe
d agreements that are51

reflected
 in  the  carrying  value  of  the  inventory  when  earned  or  as  the  Company  progresses  towards  earning  the  rebate  or  discount,  and  as  acomponent of
 merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costsupon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approac
h.Selling, General and Ad
ministrative ExpensesSelling,
 general  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  benefits  and  workers’  compensation  costs  for  warehouse  employees,other
 than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel.Selling,
 general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, credit and debit card processingfees, utilities, and stock-based compensation expe
nse as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.Retirement Plans
The
 Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90  days of  employment. The plan allows pre-taxdeferrals, a portion of
 which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution.The
 Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  Canadian  employees  and  contributes  a  percentage  of  each  employee's  salary.  Certainsubsidiaries
 in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amountsexpensed
 under  all  plans  were $489 , $454 ,  and $436 for 2016 , 2015 ,  and 2014 ,  respectively,  and  are  included  in  selling,  general  andadministrative expenses and merchandis
e costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.Stock-Based Compensation
Restricted
 stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based
 awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. The Company does notreduce
 stock-based  compensation  for  an  estimate  of  forfeitures,  which  are  inconsequential  in  light  of  historical  experience  and  considering  theawards vest on a quarterly basis. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
Compensation
 expense for all stock-based awards granted is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite serviceperiod
 for the entire award. The terms of the Company’s stock-based awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for acceleratedvesting
 of a portion of outstanding shares based on reaching certain cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for theaccelerated
 shares is recognized upon achievement of the long service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any pointin
 time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as themarket value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected divid
ends forgone during the vesting period.Stock-based
 compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements ofincome. See Note 7 for additional information on the C
ompany’s stock-based compensation plans.Leases
The
 Company  leases  land  and/or  buildings  at  warehouses  and  certain  other  office  and  distribution  facilities,  primarily  under  operating  leases.Operating
 leases expire at various dates through 2064 ,  with the exception of one lease in the Company’s U.K. subsidiary, which expires in 2151 . These
 leases  generally  contain  one  or  more  of  the  following  options,  which  the  Company  can  exercise  at  the  end  of  the  initial  lease  term:(a) renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated

in
 the lease agreement; (b) purchase of the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchaseoffer.
The
 Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of thelease and
 any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property.Certain leases provide for periodic rental incre
ases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume.The
 Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2054 .  Capital lease assets are included in landand
 buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded asdepreciation
 expense  and  is  predominately  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Capital  lease liabilities  are  recorded  at  thelesser
 of the estimated fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and areincluded
 in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest on these obligations is included ininterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company
 records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where itis
 considered  the  owner  for  accounting  purposes,  to  the  extent  the  Company  is  involved  in  the  construction  of  the  building  or  structuralimprovements
 or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangementsqualify
 for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for thearrangement as a financing lease.
The
 Company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) are primarily related to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed inorder
 to comply with the lease agreement. These obligations are recorded as a liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease termbased
 upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the leasehold improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projectedfuture
 value  of  the  obligation  using  the  Company’s  incremental  borrowing  rate.  The  ARO  assets  are  depreciated  using  the  same  depreciationmethod
 as the respective leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associatedwith
 these leases amounted to $ 64 and $ 54 at the end of 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the accompanyingconsolidated balance sheets.
Preopening Expenses
Preopening expenses relate
d to new warehouses, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future taxconsequences
 attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective taxbases
 and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxableincome
 in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxassets
 and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized  in  income  in  the  period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  A  valuation  allowance  isestablished when necessary to reduce d
eferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.The
 determination  of  the  Company’s  provision  for  income  taxes  requires  significant  judgment,  the  use  of  estimates,  and  the  interpretation  andapplication
 of  complex  tax  laws.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the  timing  and  amounts  of  deductible  and  taxable  items  and  theprobability of sustaining uncertain

tax positions. The benefits of
 uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not
 probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge,  if  any,  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstanceschange, the
 Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Additionally,certain
 of the Company's cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested as of August 28, 2016. These earningswould
 be  subject  to  U.S.  income  tax  if  we  changed  our  position  and  could  result  in  a  U.S.  tax  liability.  Although  the  Company  has  historicallyasserted
 that  certain  non-U.S.  undistributed  earnings  will  be  permanently  reinvested,  it  may  repatriate  such  earnings  to  the  extent  it  can  do  sowithout an adverse tax consequence. See N
ote 8 for additional information.Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The
 computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  Thecomputation
 of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus thenumber
 of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stockmethod for shares subject to RSUs and the “if converted” method for the convertible note securities.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased
 shares of common stock are retired,  in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchasedshares
 is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital andretained
 earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and isapplied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaini
ng amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.Recently Adopted Accoun
ting PronouncementsIn
 November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities byjurisdiction,
 along with any related valuation allowance. The guidance requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet on
 either a prospective or retrospective basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within thoseyears
 beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt the guidance at the beginning of thesecond
 quarter  of  fiscal  year  2016  on  a  retrospective  basis  and  reclassified  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  from  current  to  non-current.  Thereclassifications
 reduced other current assets and other liabilities by $520 and $410 ,  respectively, increased other assets by $109 ,  and had animmaterial impact
 on other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2015. Adoption ofthis guidance also had an immaterial imp
act on the total assets by segment as disclosed in Note 11.In
 April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by recording deferred debt issuance costs as a directdeduction
 from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, andinterim
 periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt the guidance at the beginning of its firstquarter
 of fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. The Company reclassified deferred issuance costs from other assets to the respective debtliability.
 Adoption  of  this  guidance  and  prior  fiscal  year  reclassifications  had  an  immaterial  impact  on  previously  reported  consolidated  financialstatements and an immaterial impact on the total assets by segment as disclosed in Note 1
1.In
 April  2014,  the  FASB  issued  guidance  that  changed  the  criteria  for  reporting  discontinued  operations,  as  well  as  requiring  new  disclosuresregarding
 discontinued operations and disposals that do not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This guidance became effective for fiscalyears beginning after

osures.Recent Accounting Pronounceme
nts Not Yet AdoptedIn
 May  2014,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  on  the  recognition  of  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers.  The  guidance  converges  therequirements
 for reporting revenue and requires disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cashflows
 arising from these contracts. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of thedate
 of adoption. The new standard is effective  for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. TheCompany plans to adopt this guidanc
e at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019.In
 February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leases, which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet forthe
 rights and obligations created by all leases with terms greater than twelve months. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periodswithin those years beginning after December 15,
 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning ofits first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
In
 March  2016,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  on  stock  compensation,  which  is  intended  to  simplify  accounting  for  share-based  paymenttransactions.
 The guidance will change several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions,  including accounting forincome
 taxes, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periodswithin those years beginning after December 15,
 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning ofits first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
The Company is evaluating the impact of these standards o

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued)
RSUs
 held  by  employees  and  non-employee  directors  are  subject  to  quarterly  vesting  upon  certain  terminations  of  employment  or  service.Employees
 who attain certain years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting daterather
 than upon retirement. The Seventh Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan), amended in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, is theCompany’s only
 stock-based compensation plan with shares available for grant at the end of 2016 . Each share  issued in respect of stock awards iscounted as 
1.75 shares toward  the limit of shares made available under the Seventh Plan. The Seventh Plan authorized the issuance of 23,500,000 shares
 ( 13,429,000 RSUs)  of common stock for future grants in addition to the shares authorized under the previous plan. The Company issuesnew shares of
 common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares equal tothe minimum statutory withholding taxes.
As
 required by the Company's Seventh Plan, in conjunction with the special cash dividend discussed in Note 6, adjustments were made to awardsoutstanding
 on the dividend record date to preserve their value following the dividend, as follows: (i) the number of shares subject to outstandingRSUs
 was increased; and (ii) the exercise prices of outstanding stock options were reduced and the number of shares subject to such options wasincreased. Approximately 
410,000 stock options were adjusted, and approximately 8,956,000 RSUs were adjusted. These adjustments did n ot resultin
 additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the outstanding awards did not change. As further required by the SeventhPlan,
 the maximum number of shares issuable under the Seventh Plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 750,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
RSUs
 granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five years and three years,  respectively. Additionally, the terms ofthe RSUs, including performance-based a
wards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 ormore
 years and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively, and provide for vesting upon certain terminations of employment orservice. Recipients are not
 entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested and undelivered shares. At the end of 2016 , 15,068,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs un
der the Seventh Plan.The following awards were outstand
ing at the end of 2016 : •
7,878,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employme nt over specified periods of time;•
448,000 performance-based  RSUs,  of  which 236,000 were  granted  to  executive  officers  subject  to  the  certification  of  the  attainment  ofspecified
 performance targets for 2016 . This  certification occurred in September 2016 ,  at which time a portion vested as a result of the longservice of all executive officers. The remaining awards vest upon co

$297 and $51 , respectively, included in other liabilities.The
 Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries as suchearnings
 are deemed by the Company to be indefinitely reinvested because its subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earningsindefinitely,
 or  the  earnings  if  repatriated  would  not  result  in  an  adverse  tax  consequence.  Deferred  taxes  are  recorded  for  earnings  of  foreignoperations when it is determined that such earnin
gs are no longer indefinitely reinvested.During
 2015, the Company repatriated a portion of the earnings in the Canadian operations that, in 2014, the Company determined were no longerconsidered
 indefinitely  reinvested.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  the  Company  changed  its  position  regarding  an  additional  portion  of  theundistributed
 earnings of the Canadian operations, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. These earnings were distributed in 2016.Current
 exchange  rates  compared  to  historical  rates  when  these  earnings  were  generated  resulted  in  an  immaterial  U.S.  benefit,  which  wasrecorded
 at  the  end  of  2015.  Subsequent  to  the  end  of  fiscal  2016,  the  Company  determined  that  a  portion  of  the  undistributed  earnings  of  itsCanadian
 operations  could  be  repatriated  without  adverse  tax  consequences.  Accordingly,  the  Company  no  longer  considers  that  portion  to  beindefinitely reinvested.
The
 Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $3,280 and $2,845 at  the end of 2016 and 2015 , respectively, of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsi

the
 subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings, if repatriated would not result in an adverse taxconsequence.
 Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits and complexity of the computation, it is not practicable to determine the U.S.federal income tax liability that would be ass
ociated with such earnings if such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.The
 Company believes that its U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet its U.S. liquidity requirements and has no current plansto
 repatriate for use in the U.S. the cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings areconsidered indefinitely 
reinvested.A reconciliation of the beginni
ng and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  
2016   2015 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginnin
g of year$ 158  $75 Gross increases—current year tax positions
2  26 Gross increases—tax positions in prior years
1  63 Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years
(47 ) (1 )Settlements
(25 ) (3 )Lapse of statute of limitations
(37 ) (2 )Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year
$ 52  $158 The gross unrecognized tax benefit inclu
des tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timingof
 such deductibility. At the end of 2016 and 2015 ,  these amounts were immaterial and $50 , respectively. Because of the impact of deferred taxaccounting,
 other  than  interest  and  penalties,  the  disallowance  of  these  tax  positions  would  not  affect  the  annual  effective  tax  rate  but  wouldaccelerate
 the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. At the end of 2015, the Company recorded an offsetting long-term assetof 
$48 . There was no offsetting long-term asset at the end of 2016.The
 total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $46 and 
$98 at the end of 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Accrued
 interest  and  penalties  related  to  income  tax  matters  are  classified  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense.  Interest  and  penaltiesrecognized by the Company were not material in 
2016 and 2015 . Accrued interest and penalties were not material at the end of 2016 and 2015 . The
 Company  is  currently  under  audit  by  several  taxing  jurisdictions  in  the  United  States  and  in  several  foreign  countries.  Some  audits  mayconclude
 in the  next  12 months  and the unrecognized  tax  benefits  we have recorded  in relation  to  the  audits may  differ  from  actual  settlementamounts.
 It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertaintax positions in connection with the audits. The
 Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount ofunrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.
The
 Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada and in several other foreign jurisdictions.With
 few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2013. The Company iscurrently
 subject to examination in Canada for fiscal years 2012 to present and in California for fiscal years 2007 to present. No other examinationsare believed to be material.

Legal Proceedings
The
 Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance withapplicable
 accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where theypresent loss continge
ncies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. TheCompany
 monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnificationarrangements
 concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date ofthis
 Report, the Company has recorded an immaterial accrual with respect to two matters described below. If the loss contingency at issue is notboth
 probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments thatwill
 make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred,including
 a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (includingany loss in
 excess of the accrual) cannot in our view be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought areindeterminate
 or  unspecified;  (ii)  the  legal  and/or  factual  theories  are  not  well  developed;  and/or  (iii)  the  matters  involve  complex  or  novel  legaltheories or a large number of parties.
The Company is a defendant in the follow
ing matters, among others:Numerous putative class
 actions have been brought around the United States against motor fuel retailers, including the Company, alleging that theyhave
 been overcharging consumers by selling gasoline or diesel that is warmer than 60 degrees without adjusting the volume sold to compensatefor heat-related expansion or disclosing the effect
 of such expansion on the energy equivalent received by the consumer. The Company is named inthe

 Amoco Oil Company, et al., Case No. 07-cv-00661 (D. Utah); and Mark Wyatt, et al., v. B. P. America Corp., et al., Case No. 07-1754 (S.D. Cal.).On
 June 18, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation assigned the action, entitled In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litigation,MDL
 Docket No 1840, to Judge Kathryn Vratil in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. On April 12, 2009, the Company agreedto
 settle  the actions  in which it is named as a defendant.  Under  the settlement,  which was subject  to final approval by the court,  the Companyagreed,
 to the extent allowed by law and subject to other terms and conditions in the agreement, to install over five years from the effective date ofthe
 settlement temperature-correcting dispensers in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico,North
 Carolina,  South  Carolina,  Tennessee,  Texas,  Utah,  and  Virginia.  Other  than  payments  to  class  representatives,  the  settlement  does  notprovide
 for  cash  payments  to  class  members.  On  September  22,  2011,  the  court  preliminarily  approved  a  revised  settlement,  which  did  notmaterially
 alter the terms. On April 24, 2012, the court granted final approval of the revised settlement. A class member who objected has filed anotice
 of appeal from the order approving the settlement. Plaintiffs have moved for an award of $10 in attorneys’ fees, as well as an award of costsand
 payments to class representatives. A report and recommendation has been issued in favor of a fee award of $3.8 ,  to which the Company isobjecting. On August 24, 2016, the
 district court affirmed the report and recommendation. On March 20, 2014, the Company filed a notice invoking a“most favored nation” provision under
 the settlement, under which it seeks to adopt provisions in later settlements with certain other defendants. Themotion was denied on January 23, 201
5. Final judgment was entered on September 22, 2015, and the Company has filed a notice of appeal.The
 Company received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and records ofthe
 Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed propertysubject
 to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. Certain states have separately also maderequests for payment by the Company concerning a specific type of property, some of which have b
een paid in immaterial amounts.The
 Company  has  received  from  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  subpoenas  and  administrative  inspection  warrants  concerning  theCompany'
s fulfillment of prescriptions related to controlled substances and related practices. Offices of the United States Attorney in various districtshave
 communicated  to  the  Company  their  belief  that  the  Company  has  committed  civil  regulatory  violations  concerning  these  subjects.  TheCompany is seeking to cooperate with these process
es and is holding discussions concerning a potential resolution.The
 Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effecton the
 Company’s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could resultin a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal q
