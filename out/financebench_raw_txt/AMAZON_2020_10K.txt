Item 1.
Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated here
in by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations,estimates, and projections as of the da
te of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of PartI — “Risk Factors.”
Amazon.com, Inc.’s principa
l corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our commonstock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Se
lect Market under the symbol “AMZN.”As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” 
“our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.General
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion forinvention, commitment 
to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers,sellers, developers, ent
erprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others,through programs such as sponsored ads, disp
lay, and video advertising.        We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the waythe Company evaluates its busin
ess performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segmen
t Information.”Consumers
We serve consumers through our on
line and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds ofmillions of unique products to b
e sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobileapps, Alexa, devices, stream
ing, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo,Ring, and other devices, and we develop 
and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality,and timely customer se
rvice. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, accessto unlimited stream
ing of tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes, including Amazon Original content, and other benefits.We fulfill custome
r orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced andoutsourced arrangements 
in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which aresupplemented by co-sourced a
rrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”Sellers
We offer programs tha
t enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of recordin these transactions. We
 earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.Developers and Enterprises
We serve developers and en
terprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad setof on-demand technology servi
ces, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services.Content Creators
We serve authors and independ
ent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royaltyoption and make their books ava
ilable in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allowauthors, musicians, film
makers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.3

Table of ContentsCompetition
Our businesses encompass a large v
ariety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete isevolving rapidly and intense
ly competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current andpotential competito
rs include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the productswe offer and sell to consume
rs and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distributionchannels; (3) web search eng
ines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, oracquiring goods an
d services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including websitedevelopment and hosting, omnich
annel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing;(5) companies that provid
e fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide informationtechnology services or produc
ts, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sellconsumer electronics, telecommu
nication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies thatprovide advertising servi
ces, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price,and convenience, inclu
ding fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, andreliability of our se
rvices and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors havegreater resources, long
er histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may securebetter terms from supp
liers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to theirown offerings instead of ours, lock
-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, andmarketing. The Interne
t facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to competeagainst us. Each of our businesses is 
also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors.Other companies also may en
ter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectualproperty as critica
l to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements withour employees, customers, pa
rtners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. andinternational domain n
ames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain ofour proprietary technology.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by season
ality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.Human Capital
Our employees are crit
ical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately1,298,000 full-time and part
-time employees. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competitionfor qualified personnel h
as historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.We focus on investment and innov
ation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous andevolving initiatives to 
implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including industry-leading pay and benefits, skills trainingprograms such as Amazon Career Choi
ce and the Amazon Technical Academy, mentorship and support resources, and programs that advance engagement,communication, and feedb
ack.Available Information
Our investor relations websit
e is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly makeavailable on this website, 
free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), corporate governanceinformation (including ou

Risk Factors Please carefully consid
er the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The eventsand consequences discussed in thes
e risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a materialadverse effect on our busin
ess, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows,liquidity, and stock price. Th
ese risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that arenot presently known to us or that we cur
rently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemicand resulting global disrupt
ions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations,” and in the 
risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give riseto or amplify many of the 
risks discussed below.Business and Industry Risks
We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolv
ing and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, andin different industries, i
ncluding physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronicdevices, digital conten
t, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longerhistories, more custome
rs, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. Theymay secure better t
erms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition continues to int
ensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as ourcompetitors enter in
to business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Inaddition, new and enhanced techno
logies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increaseour competition. The Inte
rnet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses tocompete against us. As a resul
t of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may berequired to increase ou
r spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks
We may have limited o
r no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,which can present new and diffi
cult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures orother quality issues. In addi
tion, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these neweractivities to recoup ou
r investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the valueof those investments being wri
tten down or written off.Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are
 significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international marketsegments, we have relati
vely little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish,develop, and maintain int
ernational operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on asustained basis.
In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•
local economic and political conditions;•
government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as tradeprotection measures, in
cluding export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;•
restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, includinguncertainty as a result of
 less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regardingthe physical and digital
 distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;6

Table of Contents•
business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•
limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•
limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•
shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•
laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions onpricing or discounts;
•
lower levels of use of the Internet;•
lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•
lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•
difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•
different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;•
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officialsand other third parties;
•
laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•
geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international physical, 
e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolvingbusiness models. Local compani
es may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, aswell as their more est
ablished local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Ind
ia regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and licenserequirements that may restrict (i) f
oreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internetcontent, and (iii) the s
ale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurityrequirements, we provide c
ertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. InIndia, the government res
tricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. Forwww.amazon.in, we provide certain m
arketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we holdindirect minority in
terests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities complywith existing laws, they involve uniqu
e risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory,licensing, or other requi
rements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indianlaws and regulations, and it is poss
ible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses andoperations may be unable to 
continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we orour affiliates have 
in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws andregulations could result 
in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced torestructure our opera
tions or shut down entirely.7

Table of ContentsThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
Demand for our products and servi
ces can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, orunforeseeable events, such 
as in response to natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionateamount of our retail sa
les to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meetcustomer demand could signi
ficantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventorymarkdowns or write-offs and incu
r commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost dueto complimentary upgrad
es, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customersaccess our websites within a shor
t period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or preventus from efficiently 
fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we maybe unable to adequately st
aff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies andcustomer service co-sou
rcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimizationand inventory are magnif
ied during periods of high demand.We generally have paym
ent terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumercustomers. As a result of holid
ay sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highestlevel (other than as a 
result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase inaccounts payable as of Dece
mber 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a correspondingdecline in our cash, cash equ
ivalents, and marketable securities balances.We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Se
llersThe law relating to the l
iability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the futurerequire changes in the way th
is business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collectingpayments, fraudulently or o
therwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’descriptions, and to prevent s
ellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful orunethical manner, viol
ating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail tooperate sufficient
ly, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under ourA2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers 
for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program willincrease and could negat
ively affect our operating results.We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protec
ting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of ThirdParties
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical toour success, and we rely on trade
mark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,customers, and others to prot
ect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products andservices are made av
ailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore,regulations governing domain n
ames may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiringdomain names that are s
imilar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.We are not always able to d
iscover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license ourproprietary rights may 
materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure ofsignificant financi
al and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights orprevent third parties 
from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwiseacquire equivalent or su
perior technology or other intellectual property rights.We have been subject to, and 
expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectualproperty rights of third pa
rties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financialand managerial resour
ces, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses fromthird parties who allege 
that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplifiedby the increase in third p
arties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.8

Table of ContentsOur digital content offe
rings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioningof the digital rights m
anagement technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, 
and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposedto foreign exchange rat
e fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains orlosses on the remeasurem
ent of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations hasincreased. We also hold c
ash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. When theU.S. Dollar strengthens compared to 
these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expectedand vice versa.
Operating Risks
Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are continuing to rap
idly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling ourinfrastructure to suppor
t our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management,personnel, operations, systems, 
technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases thesefactors. Failure to man
age growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We are not always able to 
accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion ofour expenses and investments is 
fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustain
able, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on thecontinued growth of demand for th
e products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditionsworldwide. A softening of demand, whether 
caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreasedrevenue or growth.
Our sales and operating resul
ts will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:•
our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;•
our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;•
our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;•
the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;•
changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;•
timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;•
the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;•
the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;•

izing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data CentersFailures to adequately 
predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to timeresult in excess or insuff
icient fulfillment or data center capacity, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As wecontinue to add fulfill
ment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks becomeincreasingly complex and op
erating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.In addition, failure to op
timize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and ourco-sourcers may be una
ble to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain theinventory of other compani
es, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle suchinventory or the inabili
ty of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in usbeing unable to secure suff
icient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business andreputation.
We rely on a limited nu
mber of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. The inability to negotiate acceptableterms with these compani
es or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negativelyimpact our operating r
esults and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers alsomay be negatively aff
ected by natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
Because we collect, process, s
tore, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information,failure to prevent or 
mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products,and systems, could: expose us or our cus
tomers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result inlitigation, liabil
ity, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); detercustomers or sellers f
rom using our stores and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety ofreasons, including, without lim
itation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and otherfunctions. Some of our systems have 
experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, therecan be no assurance of a sim
ilar result in the future. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and preventsuch incidents, including syste
ms and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannotprovide absolute security 
and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occas
ional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us fromefficiently acc
epting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services.Steps we take to add software and ha
rdware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not besufficient to avoid syste
m interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.10

Table of ContentsOur computer and communica
tions systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such asnatural or man-made disasters
, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses,physical or electroni
c break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and couldprevent us from accept
ing and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject usto liability. Our systems a
re not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficientcoverage to compensate 
for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain H
ighly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect OurBusiness
We depend on our senior manage
ment and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “keyperson” life insurance po
licies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically beenintense, particular
ly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or theinability to hire, tr
ain, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppl
iers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to oursourcing, services, manufa
cturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of oursuppliers to guarantee av
ailability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by ourcurrent suppliers to li
mit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as aresult of one or more suppli
er bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable toprocure alternativ
es from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or othervendors of applicable laws, r
egulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practicesregarded as unethical, uns
afe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Allianc
es, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to RisksWe provide physical, e-c
ommerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and businessrelationships. Under these ag
reements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers tooffer products or servic
es through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resourcecommitments, which may l
imit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of thesecommercial relationships, w
hich may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware,content, and third-party so
ftware, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercialagreements is parti
ally dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensationwe receive may be lower
 than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercialrelationships and strat
egic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we areunsuccessful in implemen
ting, maintaining, or developing these services.As our agreements termin
ate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter intoamendments on less favorab
le terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operatingresults.
Our present and fut
ure e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
impairment of other relationships;•
variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and•
difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.11

Table of ContentsOur Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and inves
ted in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additionalcompanies. These transac
tions create risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
problems retaining key personnel;•
additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;•
the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;•
the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result ofany integration of opera
tions;•
the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;•
the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;•
the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and otheradministrative syste
ms to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;•
losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into ourfinancial results;
•
for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on theinvestee’s accounting, f
inancial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;•
the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;•
the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;•
potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and•
for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, andregulatory risks associate
d with specific countries.As a result of future acquis
itions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, oramortization expenses 
related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, ifat all. In addition, valu
ations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations haveexperienced impairments or ot
her-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed tosignificant inventory r
isks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles andpricing, defective m
erchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,and other factors. We end
eavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand forproducts, however, can change signi
ficantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling ormanufacturing a new product, 
it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecastdemand. The acquisition of c
ertain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry abroad selection and signif
icant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantitiesor to meet demand during th
e relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks
We accept payments using
 a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debitfrom a customer’s bank a
ccount, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to ourcustomers, we currently a
re subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implementenhanced authentication
12

Table of Contentsprocesses that could resul
t in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including creditand debit cards, we pay inter
change and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties toprovide certain Amazon-b
randed payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, andpromotional financing. In 
each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card prog
rams, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to paymentcard association opera
ting rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or bereinterpreted to m
ake it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failureto otherwise detect or pr
event fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to finesand higher transaction f
ees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitateother types of online paymen
ts, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.In addition, we provide regula
ted services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to thirdparties, and because we provid
e services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatoryinspection, bonding and capita
l maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, andauthentication. We a
re also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, internationalmoney transfers, privacy, d
ata protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation ofapplicable laws or regul
ations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highl
y VolatileWe have a rapidly evolving bus
iness model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risksdescribed elsewhere in th
is Item 1A, as well as:•
changes in interest rates;•
conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;•
quarterly variations in operating results;•
fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;•
changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;•
changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;•
changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•
changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•
transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.Volatility in our stock pri
ce could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees orgrant larger stock awards 
than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, orboth.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to gene
ral business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, andomnichannel retail, digital co
ntent, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and servicesthat we offer or sell. Thes
e regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content,copyrights, distributi
on, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation,electronic contra
cts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services,registration, licens
ing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation ofwebsites, health, safety, and s
anitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation ofunmanned aircraft syst
ems, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data protection, datasecurity, network security, 
and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronicdevices, advertising, and a
rtificial13

Table of Contentsintelligence techno
logies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving andexpanding as the scope of our business
es expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatoryauthorities under exist
ing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, a number ofregulators have opened inves
tigations to assess whether aspects of our operations violate competition rules. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, orinterpretations by govern
ment or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened orinitiated by them, could 
cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetaryfines), diminish the dem
and for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in amanner material
ly adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations.Claims, Litigation, Government Investigat
ions, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of OperationsAs an innovative company offer
ing a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual andthreatened claims, 
litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a widerange of issues, including pat
ent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data protection, datasecurity, network security, 
consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number andscale of these proceed
ings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operationshave become more compl
ex and available to, and used by, more people. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs,disruption of our operations, div
ersion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictableand subject to significan
t uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range ofuncertainties and unpred
ictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and suchamounts could be materi
al. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business,consolidated financia
l position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as aresult of a settlem
ent, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offeringcertain products or serv
ices, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringingor otherwise altered produ
cts or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.We Are Subject to Product Liability Clai
ms When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or ManufactureSome of the products we sell or m
anufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmentalor property damage, and can 
require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liabilityclaims. Although we maintain 
liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance willcontinue to be availabl
e to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales ofcertain type of products, we 
may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreementswith our vendors and sellers do not ind
emnify us from product liability.14

Table of ContentsWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Colle
ction ObligationsWe are subject to a va
riety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognizeadditional tax expense and b
e subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,administrative pra
ctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accountingrules in various jurisdic
tions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions areconsidering or have adopted l
aws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and theremote selling of goods and se
rvices. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remotesellers, or other requi
rements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countrieshave proposed or enacted tax
es on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected byadditional taxes of this n
ature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collectionobligations or failure 
to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. Insome cases we also may not have su
fficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collectionobligations by the effec
tive date.Our tax expense and liabili
ties are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into newbusinesses and geographies, inte
rcompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able torealize related tax benefits, the a
pplicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price,changes to our forecasts of 
income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In theordinary course of our business, th
ere are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is requiredin evaluating and estim
ating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.We are also subject to 
tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, orother tax controversy can h
ave a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as forprior and subsequent periods. We 
regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our taxaccruals. Although we believe ou
r tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materiallydifferent from our historical ta
x accruals.We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Relat
ed Procurement RegulationsOur contracts with U.S., as well as stat
e, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirementsrelating to their fo
rmation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violationscould result in various civ
il and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeitureof profits, payment of fin
es, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic fundingapproval and/or provide for 
termination by the government at any time, without cause.Item 1B.

looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actualresults could differ material
ly for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions andcustomer spending, world events, the rate o
f growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new businessopportunities and the timing of those 
investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared withservices, the extent 
to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growthand expansion, the outcomes of claims, li

ly, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items soldby third-party sellers 
as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. Wealso offer other servi
ces such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainab
le growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven pr imarily by increasing operating income andefficiently manag
ing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property andequipment. Increases in 
operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partiallyoffset by investments 
we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase salesof products and services, we focus on 
improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster deliveryand performance tim
es, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information,improving ease of use, improv
ing reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additionalinformation on our non-GAAP free cash f
lows financial measures.We seek to reduce our variabl
e costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include p roduct and content costs, payment processingand related transac
tion costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and aportion of our marketing cos
ts. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to ouronline stores, web services, e
lectronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costsgenerally change dire
ctly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion,and other factors. To decr
ease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increasediscounts from suppliers, and r
educe defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies andmaintain a lean culture.
Because of our model we are able to turn our inv
entory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle.  On average, our high inventory velocity meanswe generally collect from co
nsumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected bynumerous factors, including ou
r product mix, the mix of sales The operating cycle is th
e number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.11

rs, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies andproduct lines, and the exten
t to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over timesince they are affe
cted by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changesin payment terms over t
ime, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in te
chnology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, andmerchandising employees. Our technology and con
tent investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due togeographic expansion and the cross-func
tionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, includingAWS, and expansion of new and existing product 
categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience andimprove our process efficienc
ies. We believe that advan ces in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics,improved wireless con
nectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on theInternet and increas
e its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers abroad set of on-demand techno
logy services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers andenterprises of all si
zes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices.We seek to effici
ently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions,and aligning employee compensation with shareho
lders’ interests. We utilize restr icted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because webelieve this compensat
ion model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested andunvested stock awards outstanding, withou
t regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 512 million and 518million as of December 31, 2019 
and 2020.Our financial reporting currency is 
the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens y
ear-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses willbe higher than if curren
cies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, ourconsolidated net sales and op
erating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond theU.S. economy through our growing internation
al businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operatingresults and growth rates befo
re and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasu
rement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreigncurrency exchange rat
es. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidatedtrends and comparisons.

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting globa
l disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers, suppliers, and third-party sellers.To serve our customers while a
lso providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics,transportation, supply chain, pu
rchasing, and third-party seller processes. Beginning in Q1 2020, we made numerous process updates across our operationsworldwide, and adapted our fulfi
llment network, to implement employee and customer safety measures, such as enhanced cleaning and physical distancing,personal protective ge
ar, disinfectant spraying, and temperature checks. Since February 2020, we have hired over 400,000 full-time and part-time employees toincrease our fulfil
lment network capacity. We incurred approximately $4.0 billion in COVID-19 related costs in Q4 2020, for a total of more than $11.5 billionduring 2020. We will continue to pr
ioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving federal, state, and local standards as well as to implementstandards or processes that we d
etermine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.20

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Judgments
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates andassumptions that affec
t the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidatedfinancial statem
ents and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal ofthe company’s financia
l condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result ofthe need to make estimates 
of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgmentsaddressed below. We also have oth
er key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understandingour results. For additional in
formation, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, AccountingPolicies, and Supplemental Disc
losures.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon informationpresently available. Ac
tual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptionsabout future disposition of inv
entory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in thefuture. As a measure of sensi
tivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020, we would have recorded an additional costof sales of approximate
ly $270 million.In addition, we enter
 into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecastedcustomer demand. If we redu
ce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income Taxes
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles,and interpretations in v
arious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, andsignificant judgment is 
required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinarycourse of business for which the ul
timate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic,political, and other cond
itions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.Our effective tax ra
tes could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into newbusinesses and geographies, inte
rcompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictionswhere we have lower statutory r
ates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which weare not able to real
ize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changesto our forecasts of incom
e and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes inthe laws, regulations, admin
istrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and otherlaws and accounting rules in va
rious jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable tocorporate multinationals.
We are also current
ly subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.Developments in an audit, inves
tigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods forwhich that development occu
rs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from theseproceedings to determin
e the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, andany other tax controversi
es could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.21

(10,066) (1,104) Our principal sources of liqu

lion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $15.3 billion and $23.5 billion as ofDecember 31, 2019 and 2020, and were prim
arily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.Cash provided by (used in) operating 
activities was $38.5 billion and $66.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cashreceived from our consum
er, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products andservices, employee comp
ensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cashreceived from our custo
mers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, ourreceivables from consu
mers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increase in netincome, excluding non-cash exp
enses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, includingvariability in demand, 
inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreignexchange rates.
Cash provided by (used in) investing a
ctivities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received fromproperty and equipment vendors, p
roceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, andpurchases, sales, and matur
ities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(24.3) billion and $(59.6) billion in 2019 and 2020,with the variability c
aused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities.Cash capital expenditures we
re $12.7 billion, and $35.0 billion in 2019 and 2020, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support ourfulfillment opera
tions and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments weexpect to continue over t
ime. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion in2019 and 2020.
Cash provided by (used in) financing 
activities was $(10.1) billion and $(1.1) billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted fromproceeds of short-term d
ebt, and other and long-term-debt of $2.3 billion and $17.3 billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted frompayments of short-term d
ebt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $12.3 billion and $18.4 billion in 2019 and 2020. Property andequipment acquired under 
finance leases was $13.7 billion and $11.6 billion in 2019 and 2020, reflecting investments in support of continued business growthprimarily due to invest
ments in technology infrastructure for AWS.We had no borrowings outstanding under th
e unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”), $725 million of borrowings outstanding under thecommercial paper p
rogram (the “Commercial Paper Program”), and $338 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the “CreditFacility”) as of Decemb
er 31, 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equiva
lents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $17.2 billion. We intend to invest substantiallyall of our foreign subsidia
ry earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we wouldincur significant, addi
tional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.Tax benefits relating 
to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income, and allremaining federal 
tax credits, which were primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, reduced our federal tax liability in 2020. U.S. taxrules provide for enhanced 
accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022.Our federal tax provision in
cluded the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election for 2020. Cash taxes paid (net ofrefunds) were $881 million and $1.7 b
illion for 2019 and 2020. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.In connection with the European Com
mission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount,consistent with the
22

Table of ContentsEuropean Commission’s decision, of 
approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of allappeals.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, restric
ted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $321 million and $257 million. See Item 8 of Part II,“Financial Statements 
and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractualcommitments, as well as ou
r pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventorycommitments, were $26.6 bil
lion as of December 31, 2020. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part throughthe contractual provis
ions.We believe that cash 
flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowingarrangements, will be suf
ficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs andcash flows are subject to subst
antial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debtsecurities, obtain cr
edit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, orrepurchase, refinanc
e, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting globa
l disruptions have caused significant market volatility. These disruptions can contribute to defaults in ouraccounts receivable, affect asset
 valuations resulting in impairment charges, and affect the availability of lease and financing credit as well as other segments of thecredit markets. We h
ave utilized a range of financing methods to fund our operations and capital expenditures and expect to continue to maintain financingflexibility in the cu
rrent market conditions. However, due to the rapidly evolving global situation, it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequencesof the pandemic are reasona
bly likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.The sale of additional equ
ity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider theacquisition of, or investm
ent in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidityrequirements or cause us 
to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines orfinancing instruments wil
l be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.23

Table of ContentsResults of Operations
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates itsbusiness performance and m
anages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.”Effects of COVID-19
As reflected in the discuss
ion below, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it had varying effects on our 2020 results ofoperations. Higher net sales 
in the North America and International segments reflect increased demand, particularly as people are staying at home, including forhousehold staples and other essen
tial and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. Other effects in the NorthAmerica and International se
gments include increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to the impact of lowerproductivity, increased 
employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces.We expect the effects of fulfillment
 network capacity and supply chain constraints, elevated collection risk in our accounts receivable, and increasedfulfillment costs and 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue into all or portions of Q1 2021. However, it is not possible to determine the duration andscope of the pandemic, inc
luding any recurrence, the actions taken in response to the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, anyongoing effects on consumer de
mand and spending patterns, or other impacts of the pandemic, and whether these or other currently unanticipated consequences ofthe pandemic are reasonably
 likely to materially affect our results of operations.24

Table of ContentsNet Sales
Net sales include product and s
ervice sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media contentwhere we record revenue gross. Serv
ice sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees,AWS sales, advertising servic
es, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):

ct of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales incr
eased 38% in 2020, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Incre

Cost of sales primarily cons

e we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sa
les in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting fromincreased sales. We exp
ect cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs.Shipping costs to receive produc
ts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.Shipping costs, which include sortat
ion and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $37.9 billion and $61.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. We expect our cost ofshipping to continue to incre
ase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods,including faster deliv
ery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes,optimizing our fulfillment net
work, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices toour customers is fundament
al to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment ar
e primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both ourinternal technology requ
irements and external sales to AWS customers.27

Table of ContentsFulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores,and customer service c
enters and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWScosts are primarily 
classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as paymentprocessing and related t
ransaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent towhich third party sellers u
tilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillmentservices provided by third pa
rties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements inour operations and enhancem
ents to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transactioncosts as a percentage of n
et sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.The increase in fulfi
llment costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increasedproduct and service sales vo
lume and inventory levels, costs from expanding our fulfillment network, and the COVID-19 related impact of lower productivity,increased employee hi
ring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces. We expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negativelyimpacted through at le
ast Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs.We seek to expand our fulfi
llment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes fromsales of our own products as well as sa
les by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing productsand services, development, d
esign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, andinfrastructure costs. Infrastr
ucture costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and otherexpenses necessary to support AWS and oth
er Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety ofproducts and services to our cus
tomers.We seek to invest effi
ciently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our processefficiency through rap
id technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spendingprojects often support a va
riety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expectspending in technology and content 
to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segmentsbased on usage. The increase in 
technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll andrelated costs associa
ted with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and serviceofferings and an increas
e in spending on technology infrastructure, offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimateduseful life of our serve
rs. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, andSupplemental Disclosures — Use of Est
imates” for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers.Marketing
Marketing costs include adv
ertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissionsrelated to AWS. We direc
t customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals,social and online advert
ising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates.To the extent there is in
creased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see acorresponding change in our ma
rketing costs.The increase in marke
ting costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses forpersonnel engaged in marke
ting and selling activities, partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of COVID-19.While costs associated wi
th Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers aseffective worldwide ma
rketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.28

Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative
The increase in genera
l and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and relatedexpenses and professional serv
ice fees.Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (in
come), net was $201 million and $(75) million during 2019 and 2020, and was primarily related to a benefit from acceleratedvesting of warrants to acqui
re equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and Expense
Our interest income was $832 mi
llion and $555 million during 2019 and 2020. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds andinvestment grade short- 
to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on theprevailing rates, which va
ry depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $1.6 bill
ion in 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases.Our long-term lease li
abilities were $39.8 billion and $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our long-term debt was $23.4 billion and $31.8billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Se
e Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” foradditional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t was $203 million and $2.4 billion during 2019 and 2020. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related toequity warrant valuations, 
equity securities valuations and adjustments, and foreign currency.Income Taxes
Our effective tax ra
te is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix ofjurisdictions to which they r
elate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments,audit-related deve
lopments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses),changes in statutes, regul
ations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,competition, and other l
aws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Oureffective tax rate can be more or
 less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductibleexpenses on our effective 
tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there isuncertainty about our abi
lity to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates offuture income more ch
allenging.We recorded a provision fo
r income taxes of $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and SupplementaryData — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for 
additional information.Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measur
es, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our me
asures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet thedefinition of non-GAAP financial m
easures.We provide multiple m
easures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property andequipment with cash and through f
inance leases and financing obligations.29

All of these free cash f

iscretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representingprincipal reductions of d

e. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statementsof cash flows.

We provided guidance on February 2, 2021, 
in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflectAmazon.com’s expectations 
as of February 2, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materiallyaffected by many fac
tors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate ofgrowth of the Internet, onlin
e commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This guidance reflects ou r estimates asof 
February 2, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerousfactors that we may not be 
able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments,businesses, and individuals in respons
e to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffingand productivity, and our signif
icant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumerdemand and spending patterns, as we
ll as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes theimpacts on consumer demand 
and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experiencedduring the first quarte
r of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on ouroperations for the first 
quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materiallyaffect our operations.
First Quarter 2021 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow between 33% and 40% compared with first quarter 2020. This guidanceanticipates a favor
able impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange rates.•
Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020. This guidance assumesapproximately $2.0 billion o
f costs related to COVID-19.•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.32

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market ri
sk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.Information relat
ing to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Resul
ts of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk fo
r changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried atamortized cost and flu
ctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at afixed rate, will gener
ally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing ratesof interest.
We generally invest our 
excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixedincome securities may have t
heir fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securitiesthat have declined in m
arket value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixedincome securities, in

ebt with a face value of $33.2 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rateunsecured senior notes. See It
em 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Foreign Exchange Risk
During 2020, net sales from our Int
ernational segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from ourinternationally-fo
cused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in thefunctional currenci
es of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of ourintercompany balances 
associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, asforeign exchange rates v
ary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on theremeasurement of intercompany 
balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect theprior year, Internat
ional segment net sales increased by $1.7 billion in comparison with the prior year.33

Table of ContentsWe have foreign exchange 
risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance offoreign funds as of December 31, 2020, o
f $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of$1.2 billion, $2.4 billion, and $4.7 bill
ion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component ofstockholders’ equity.
 Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and aremeasured at fair va
lue with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as ofDecember 31, 2020, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20
% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $245 million, $485 million, and $970million, recorded to “Oth
er income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Man
agement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect ofForeign Exchange Rates” for addi
tional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment Risk
As of December 31, 2020, our recorded va
lue in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $6.9 billion. Our equity andequity warrant investmen
ts in publicly traded companies represent $3.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2020, and are recorded at fair value, which issubject to market price volatilit
y. We assess our equity investments in private companies for impairment. Valuations of private companies are inherently morecomplex due to the lack
 of readily available market data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that marketsensitivities are not practicable.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the relatedconsolidated statemen
ts of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2020 and the related 
notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of thethree years in the per
iod ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’sinternal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by theCommittee of Sponsoring Organiza
tions of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinionthereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financ
ial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’sconsolidated financia
l statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respectto the Company in accordance wi
th the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and thePCAOB.
We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performingprocedures to assess the risks o
f material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures thatrespond to those risks. Such procedures 
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financialstatements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overallpresentation of the consol
idated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated
 below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that wascommunicated or required to
 be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financialstatements and (2) involv
ed our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any wayour opinion on the consolidated f
inancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separateopinion on the critical 
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of the Matter
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of theconsolidated financia
l statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate taxdetermination is unce
rtain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determiningits provision for income t
axes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical meritsare more likely than no
t to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December31, 2020, the Company accrued liabi
lities of $2.8 billion for various tax contingencies.Auditing the measurement o
f the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position ismore likely than not to be sus
tained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involvessignificant judgment, and 
is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.36

Table of ContentsHow We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over theassessment as to whether a t
ax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of itstax positions, and the developm
ent of the related disclosures.We involved our internat
ional tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical meritsof certain of the Company’s 
tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments withthe relevant tax autho
rities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including theCompany’s correspondence with such t
ax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. Weused our knowledge of, and experienc
e with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income taxauthorities to evaluate the 
Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatoryenvironments to assess potent
ial effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzedthe Company’s assumptions and data us
ed to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of theCompany’s calculations. We h
ave also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to thesematters.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, A
CCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURESDescription of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,developers, enterprises, 
and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offerprograms that enable se
llers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians,filmmakers, skill and 
app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broadset of on-demand technology se
rvices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sellelectronic devices. 
In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsoredads, display, and video advertis
ing.We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amoun
ts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Proceeds from short-term debt, and other” werereclassified from “Proceeds fr
om long-term debt and other” and “Repayments of short-term debt, and other” were reclassified from “Repayments of long-term debtand other” on our consolidated s
tatements of cash flows.Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of itswholly-owned subsidiaries and those en
tities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in Indiaand certain entities that su
pport our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, revenu
es and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates areused for, but not limited to, 
income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-basedcompensation forfeitu
re rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Given the globaleconomic climate 
and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates have become more challenging, and actual results coulddiffer materially from these estimates.
We review the useful liv
es of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2020 we changed our estimate of the useful life for our servers fromthree years to four yea
rs. The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change inestimate for the ye
ar ended December 31, 2020, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019 and those acquiredduring the year ended Decemb
er 31, 2020, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion,or $4.06 per basic share and $3.98 per d
iluted share.43

Basic earnings per share is 
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh
ares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a netloss, stock awards are excluded 
from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.The following table shows the cal
culation of diluted shares (in millions):

luted earnings per share500 504 510 Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the 
amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, andrebates. Revenue also exclud
es any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multipleperformance obligations, t
he transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determinestand-alone selling pri
ces based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.A description of our principa
l revenue generating activities is as follows:Retail sales
 - We offer consumer produ cts through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to thecustomer, which generally o
ccurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Third-party seller services
 - We offer programs th at enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller ofrecord in these transa
ctions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services arerendered, which generally o
ccurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Subscription services
 - Our subscription sales includ e fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video,audiobooks, digital music, e-books, 
and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite ofbenefits that repres
ent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from sucharrangements is recogn
ized over the subscription period.AWS
 - Our AWS arrangements include g lobal sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-aloneselling prices and is pri
marily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacitydelivered on-demand. Cert
ain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognizedratably. Sales commissions we p
ay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.44

Table of ContentsOther
 - Other revenue primar ily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks orimpressions.
Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce 
revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in“Accrued expenses and other” 
and were $623 million, $712 million, and $859 million as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additions to the allowance were$2.3 billion, $2.5 billion, and $3.5 bill
ion and deductions from the allowance were $2.3 billion, $2.5 billion, and $3.6 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Included in“Inventories” on our consolid
ated balance sheets are assets totaling $519 million, $629 million, and $852 million as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, for therights to recover products 
from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation anddelivery centers and wher
e we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.Shipping costs to receive produc
ts from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.Payment processing and rela
ted transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statementsof operations.
Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with ou
r vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. Wegenerally consider thes
e amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, andare recorded as a redu
ction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimumpurchase thresholds. We eva
luate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can bereasonably estimated, we 
record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,physical stores, and custome
r service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, andpreparing customer orde
rs for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain sellertransactions; responding to 
inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also includeamounts paid to third part
ies that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing productsand services, development, d
esign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, andinfrastructure costs. Infrastr
ucture costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and otherexpenses necessary to support AWS and oth
er Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety ofproducts and services to our cus
tomers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred.Marketing
Marketing costs primar
ily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including salescommissions related to 
AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertisingarrangements with cer
tain of our vendors, and other third parties.Advertising and other promotion
al costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $8.2 billion, $11.0 billion, and $10.9 billionin 2018, 2019, and 2020.
45

Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative
General and administra
tive expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipmentexpenses, such as depreciat
ion and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs.Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all equ
ity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the serviceperiod. The fair value of 
restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value isrecognized as expense over 
the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that willultimately vest requires jud
gment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as acumulative adjustment in the
 period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeitureexperience and employe
e level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasure
d to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration.Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (in
come), net, consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offsetby a lease impairmen
t in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets.Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t, consists primarily of valuations and adjustments of equity securities of $145 million, $231 million, and $833 million in 2018,2019, and 2020, equity warrant valuat
ion gains (losses) of $(131) million, $11 million, and $1.5 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and foreign currency gains(losses) of $(206) million, $
(20) million, and $35 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020.During the period from January 1, 2021 
to February 2, 2021, we expect to record upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies ofapproximately $1.5 billion. 
In addition, for this same period, our equity and equity warrant investments in public companies, which are subject to volatility basedon changes in market pric
es, have experienced gains of approximately $1.5 billion based on available trading prices.Income Taxes
Income tax expense includ
es U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S.taxation and the subsequent r
epatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, aswell as our capital in our 
foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs uponrepatriation of such a
mounts.Deferred income tax balances
 reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well asnet operating loss an
d tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets represe
nt amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization andreduced by a valuation al
lowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization ofour deferred tax assets, 
including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, thecarry-forward periods av
ailable to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimatesof future earnings in re
levant jurisdictions more challenging.We utilize a two-step 
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax positionfor recognition by deter
mining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution ofrelated appeals or l
itigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized uponultimate settle
ment. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments andwhich may not accurately 
forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.46

Table of ContentsFair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as th
e price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. To i
ncrease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used tomeasure fair value:
Level 1 — 
Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 — 
Valuations based on observable inpu ts other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilitiesin active markets, quoted
 prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable 
market data.Level 3 — 
Valuations based on unobservable inpu ts reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by othermarket participan
ts. These valuations require significant judgment.We measure the fair value of m
oney market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets orliabilities. Other marketable sec
urities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similarinstruments and other signi
ficant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securitiescategorized as Level 3 
assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.We hold equity warrants giving us 
the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these warrants had a fair value of $669million and $3.0 billion, and a
re recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense),net” on our consolidated sta
tements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly 
liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventoryvaluation allowance, rep
resenting a write-down of inventory, was $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.We provide Fulfillment by Am
azon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,regardless of whether ful
fillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.We also purchase electronic 
device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for ourproducts. During the normal cours
e of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements withcontract manufacturers and s
uppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreementsconsists of firm, non-canc
ellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incuradditional costs. We also h
ave firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts rece
ivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As ofDecember 31, 2019 and 2020, customer r
eceivables, net, were $12.6 billion and $14.8 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion, and sellerreceivables, net, were $863 
million and $381 million. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides fundingto sellers primari
ly to procure inventory.We estimate losses on r
eceivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired andwritten-off when it is probab
le that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtfulaccounts was $495 million, $718 mil
lion, and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additions to the allowance were $878 million, $1.0 billion,and $1.4 billion, and deductions to th
e allowance were $731 million, $793 million, and $1.0 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020.47

Table of ContentsSoftware Development Costs
We incur software develop
ment costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Softwaredevelopment costs capit
alized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed asincurred.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipme
nt are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendorsare recorded as a redu
ction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit leasearrangements when we have cont
rol over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as serversand networking equipment, heavy equ
ipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimateduseful lives of the assets 
(generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years prior to January 1, 2020 and four yearssubsequent to January 1, 2020 for our serv
ers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three  to ten years for other fu lfillmentequipment). Depreciat
ion and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements ofoperations.
Leases
We categorize leases with co
ntractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow usto substantially utili
ze or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” Allother leases are categorized as
 operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one  to ten years for equipment and one  to twenty years forproperty.
Certain lease contra
cts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these otherservices as a component of 
the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and otherservices components based on es
timated stand-alone prices.Lease liabilities are recognized at
 the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarlysecured borrowings availabl
e to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plusany direct costs from exec
uting the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements arecapitalized at cost and amortized
 over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.When we have the o
ption to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonablycertain that we will ex
ercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variablepayments based on measures th
at include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.Costs associated with operating 
lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assetsare amortized within op
erating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does nottransfer at the end of the
 lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effectiveinterest method over th
e lease term.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Suchassets are amortized over the
 lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.Financing Obligations
We record assets and li
abilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during theconstruction period. If we con
tinue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease.The building is depreciat
ed over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.If we do not control the building 
after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the leaseas either operating or 
finance.48

Table of ContentsGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill and ind
efinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change thatindicate the carrying value ma
y not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair valueof a reporting unit or inde
finite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of eachreporting unit and indefin
ite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize animpairment loss for th
e difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on ourbest estimate of futu
re net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economicconditions.
We completed the requ
ired annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2020, resulting in noimpairments. The fai
r value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairmenttest. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acqu
ired Intangible Assets.”Other Assets
Included in “Other assets” on ou
r consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization;acquired intangible assets
, net of accumulated amortization; certain equity investments; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and lease prepaymentsmade prior to lease commencement.
Digital Video and Music Content
We obtain video content, in
clusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide rangeof licensing provisions includ
ing both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonablyestimable and the cont
ent is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments aremade and we amortize th
e asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensingfee is not determinab
le or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original videocontent for which the product
ion costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patternsassociated with the conten
t. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.5 years.Our produced and licensed video con
tent is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offerAmazon Prime membership
s. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is lessthan the carrying value. Th
e total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 were $5.8 billionand $6.8 billion. Total video and mus
ic expense was $7.8 billion and $11.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. Total video and music expenseincludes licensing and produc
tion costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions andsold or rented content.
Investments
We generally invest our 
excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Suchinvestments are includ
ed in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Marketable debt securities are cla
ssified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated othercomprehensive income (
loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well asour ability and intent to ho
ld the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income(expense), net” on our consolid
ated statements of operations.Equity investments in priva
te companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments forobservable changes in pric
es or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income(expense), net” on our consolid
ated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment isimpaired. Our assessment in
cludes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly availabledata. If the investmen
t is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these investments had a carrying value of $1.5billion and $2.7 billion.
49

Table of ContentsEquity investments are a
ccounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but notcontrol, over an investee. Equ
ity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses asreported by equity-method 
investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity- methodinvestment activity, n
et of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carryingvalue are other-than
-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.Equity investments that
 have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fairvalue with changes recogniz
ed in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwi
ll and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the c
arrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant declinein the observable marke
t value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change thatwould indicate that the c
arrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.For long-lived assets used in oper
ations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable throughits undiscounted, probability
-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fairvalue. Long-lived assets ar
e considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the assetis available for sal
e in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of costor fair value less costs 
to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued e
xpenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations,payroll and related expen
ses, tax-related liabilities, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operatingexpenses.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our liabil
ities for payroll related expenses were $4.3 billion and $7.6 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cardswere $3.3 billion and $4.7 billion. W
e reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to beredeemed is recogniz
ed based on customer usage patterns.Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is record
ed when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.Unearned revenue primar
ily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 was$10.2 billion, of which $7.9 billion was re
cognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020was $11.6 billion. Included in “Other 
long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion of unearned revenue as ofDecember 31, 2019 and 2020.
Additionally, we have perform
ance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that havenot yet been recognized in ou
r financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $50.0billion as of December 31, 2020. The we
ighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.4 years. However, the amount and timing of revenuerecognition is largely d
riven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.Other Long-Term Liabilities
Included in “Other lo
ng-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, asset retirementobligations, deferred t
ax liabilities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.Foreign Currency
We have internationa
lly-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, aredenominated in local fun
ctional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the localcurrency. Assets and liabil
ities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translatedat average rates

Pledged Assets
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged or o
therwise restricted $994 million and $875 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketablesecurities, and cert
ain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby andtrade letters of c
redit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.”Suppliers
During 2020, no vendor accounted for 10% or 
more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors toguarantee the availability of merc
handise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.Other Contingencies
We are subject to cl
aims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions inwhich we already collect 
and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significantadditional tax liabi
lities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period fromJanuary 2016 to March 2016, including in
terest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by ourthird-party sellers. 
In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we have appealed thedecision to the state Court o
f Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authoritieswere successfully to 
seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.58

The Company is involved from tim
e to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed 
a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services,LLC for patent infringemen
t in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual PrivateCloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Sca

a Distributed Computing Environment.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages,enhanced damages, attorn
eys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District ofWashington. In June 2016, the case was st
ayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January2019, the stay of the case was li
fted following resolution of the review petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselvesvigorously in this matter.
In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, In
c. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.The complaint alleges, 
among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringesU.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed Hype
rmedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction andDisplay of Embedded Objects With
in A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. InFebruary 2016, Eolas filed an am
ended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damagesreport that in the even
t of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130-$250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the UnitedStates District Court for th
e Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States DistrictCourt for the Northern Distric
t of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S.Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natura
l Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, anunspecified amount of dam
ages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations ofwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselv
es vigorously in this matter.In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed 
a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District ofIllinois. The complaint 
alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled “NetworkDistributed Tracking Wir
e Transfer Protocol,” and 7,233,978, entitled “Method And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network Separate FromThe Data To Which The Location In
formation Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs,interest, and injunctiv
e relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.Beginning in March 2020, a number of c
lass-action complaints were filed alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc.and third-party selle
rs in Amazon’s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization of an alleged market in online retail or other submarkets, and consumerprotection and unjust enri
chment claims. In March 2020, Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western Districtof Washington. Beginning in April 2020, cl
ass action complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Quebec – Division of Montreal, the Ontario Superior Court ofJustice, and the Federal Court o
f Canada against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities. The complaints allege several distinct purported classes, includingconsumers who purchased a product th
rough Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer.The complaints seek bill
ions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations ofwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselv
es vigorously in these matters.In November 2020, the European Commission 
issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in amanner that infringes EU co
mpetition rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminaryassertions of the European Comm
ission and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In addition, we are regula
rly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and otherintellectual property matters, taxe
s, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes,goods and services offered by us and by 
third parties, and other matters.The outcomes of our legal pro
ceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to ouroperating results and cash 
flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular59

al proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accrualsand reasonably possible losses dis
closed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do notinclude an estimate o
f the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss orrange of losses that could pot
entially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates andassumptions change or prove to hav
e been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on ourbusiness, consolidated financ
ial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See also “Note 9 — Income Taxes.”

In 2018, 2019, and 2020, we recorded net tax prov
isions of $1.2 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.9 billion. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-basedcompensation deductions and a
ccelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $1.2 billion, $881million, and $1.7 billion for 2018, 2019, 
and 2020.U.S. companies are
 eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-DerivedIntangible Income deduc
tion (“FDII”). In addition, certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequentrepatriation of those 
earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing theelection of full expens
ing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualifiedproperty for 2018 and 2019 and a part

Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $1.6 billion, $1.4billion, and $1.8 billion of exc
ess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2018, 2019, and 2020.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits fromstock-based compensation, and 
the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by the impact ofdevelopments in our ongoing global 
tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings and losses, an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-basedcompensation, and an incre
ase in our foreign income deduction under FDII. In addition, our Luxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilizeddeferred tax assets pr
eviously subject to valuation allowances.We intend to invest substant
ially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. inthose jurisdictions in which we would in

Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.(2)
Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions.Our valuation allowances pri
marily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as ofDecember 31, 2020. Our foreign net ope
rating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $13.4 billion before taxeffects and certa
in of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2021.All remaining federal tax credit
s, which were primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, reduced our federal tax liability in 2020.We regularly assess whethe
r it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. Inperforming this assessmen
t with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.The effects of the COVID-19 pandemi
c on our business make estimates of future earnings more challenging. Since Q2 2017, we have recorded a valuationallowance against our net d
eferred tax assets in Luxembourg. There is still significant uncertainty whether our earnings in Luxembourg are sustainable in the futureand we will maintain the va
luation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a release of the valuation allowance.Tax Contingencies
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our taxpositions and determining our p
rovision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which theultimate tax determination is u
ncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxeswill be due. These reserves a
re established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fullysupportable. We adjust thes
e reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes theimpact of reserve prov
isions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.63

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.8 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $1.5 billion, if fully recognized, would decrease oureffective tax ra
te. The decrease in our tax contingencies in 2020 was primarily a result of developments in our global tax controversies.As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had accrued 
interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $131 million and$83 million. Interest and p
enalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 was $20 million, $4million, and $(48) mill
ion.We are under examina
tion, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2013 and thereafter. Theseexaminations may lead 
to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination aswell as subsequent periods. During Q3 2020, we resolv
ed the audits of tax years 2007 through 2012 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent withour accrual.
In October 2014, the European Commission op
ened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard tothe corporate income 
tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commissionannounced its decision that d
eterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision theEuropean Commission announced an est
imated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, andordered Luxembourg tax author
ities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount,consistent with the European Comm
ission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. InDecember 2017, Luxembourg appeal
ed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to bewithout merit and will cont
inue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictionsincluding China, Germany, India, Jap
an, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additionalassessments by the relevan
t authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.Changes in tax laws, regulations, ad
ministrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution ofincome tax examinat
ions is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ fromthe amounts accrued. It 
is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possiblyreach resolution of inco
me tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related topositions on prior years’ tax 
filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. Wecannot currently provide 
an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses“Fulfillment,” “Techno
logy and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which thecosts are incurred. The m
ajority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure te
chnology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between ourreportable segments. Thes
e segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages itsoperations.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an eva
luation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of ourprincipal executive o
fficer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined inRule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of De
cember 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,as of December 31, 2020, our disclosur
e controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us inthe reports that we fil
e or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules andforms and to provide
 reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officerand principal financial officer,
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act.Management has assessed the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in InternalControl — Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment,management concluded th
at, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Ernst & Young has independently assessed 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no change
s in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonablylikely to materially affect, our i
nternal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and proc
edures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving theirobjectives as specifi
ed above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reportingwill prevent or detect 
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assu
rance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to erroror fraud will not occur or th
at all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.69

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amazon.com, 
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control —Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) m
aintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on theCOSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidatedbalance sheets of the Company 
as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’equity, and cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed anunqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over 
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of f
inancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP
