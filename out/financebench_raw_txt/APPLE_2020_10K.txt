 third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2020, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distributionchannels accounted for 34% and 66%, respe
ctively, of total net sales.No single customer accounted fo
r more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.Competition
The
 markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downwardpressure
 on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement inproduct
 price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers andbusinesses.
 Many  of  the  Company’s  competitors  seek  to  compete  primarily  through  aggressive  pricing  and  very  low  cost  structures,  and  by  emulating  theCompany’s products and in
fringing on its intellectual property.The
 Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services andtechnologies
 to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including thehardware, operating system,
 numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, productand
 service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessorie
s ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.®®

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices and services.The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that
 have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as wellas established hardware, soft
ware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines,lower-priced
 products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices andlowered
 product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.The
 Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content andapplications.
 The  Company  expects  competition  in  these  markets  to  intensify  significantly  as  competitors  imitate  the  Company’s  product  features  andapplications with
in their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.Supply of Components
Although
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle
 or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,tablets
 and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject to industry-wide shor
tage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The
 Company  uses  some  custom  components  that  are  not  commonly  used  by  its  competitors,  and  new  products  introduced  by  the  Company  often  utilizecustom
 components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  thesuppliers’
 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,may
 be  affected  if  suppliers  decide  to  concentrate  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  of  components  customized  to  meet  the  Company’srequirements.
The Company
 has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew these agreements on simi
lar terms, or at all.Substantially
 all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computersmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.
Research and Development
Because
 the  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are  characterized  by  rapid  technological  advances,  the  Company’s  ability  to  compete  successfullydepends
 heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Companycontinues
 to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual proper
ty and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.Intellectual Property
The
 Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software andservices.
 This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreigncountries.
 Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success doesdepend in part o
n such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company
 regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands ofpatent
 applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents andothers.
 The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible forprotecting
 the  Company’s  products.  The  Company  believes  the  duration  of  its  intellectual  property  rights  is  adequate  relative  to  the  expected  lives  of  itsproducts.
In
 addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by thirdparties.
 It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While theCompany
 has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could beobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at a

Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe
 Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holidaydemand.
 Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of productintroductions
 can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch,
 and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumersand distributors anticipate a p
roduct introduction.Employees
As of September 26, 2020, the Company had approxi
mately 147,000 full-time equivalent employees.Available Information

Item 1A.    Risk FactorsThe following discussion of
 risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form10-K.
 The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations”
 and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form10-K.
The
 business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, includingbut
 not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operatingresults
 to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materiallyand adversely affect
 the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.Because of the following factor
s, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should notbe considered to be a reliable 
indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.The
 Company’s  business,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  stock  price  have  been  adversely  affected  and  could  in  the  future  bematerially adversely affected by the CO
VID-19 pandemic.COVID-19
 has spread rapidly throughout  the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented  measures in response. Such measureshave
 included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19pandemic has significantly curt
ailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.The
 COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impactthe
 Company’s  business,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  stock  price.  Following  the  initial  outbreak  of  the  virus,  the  Company  experienceddisruptions
 to  its  manufacturing,  supply  chain  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing  partners,  resulting  in  temporary  iPhone  supply  shortages  thataffected
 sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic, the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarilyclosed at
 various times. In many cases, where stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and thehealth and safety of employees and customer
s. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely.The
 Company  is  continuing  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and  requirements  of  relevantauthorities.
 The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and willdepend on many factors outside the Company
’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the developmentand availability of effect
ive treatments and vaccines, the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic onthe
 global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effectson:
 demand for the Company’s products and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company’s ability to execute itsstrategic plans; and 
the Company’s profitability and cost structure.To
 the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have theeffect of heightening many of the other risk
s described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Global
 and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition andgrowth.
The
 Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a majority of theCompany’s
 supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performancedepend significantly on 
global and regional economic conditions.Adverse
 macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal andmonetary
 policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’sproducts
 and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financialnews,
 conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcarecosts and other economic factors.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5

In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have asignificant
 impact  on  the  Company’s  suppliers,  contract  manufacturers,  logistics providers,  distributors,  cellular network  carriers  and  other  channel  partners.Potential effects include
 financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.A
 downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivativecounterparties
 and  other  financial  institutions;  limitations  on  the  Company’s  ability  to  issue new  debt;  reduced  liquidity;  and  declines  in  the  fair  value  of  theCompany’s
 financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financialcondition and growth.
Global markets for the Company’s p
roducts and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may beunable to compete effectively in these markets.
The
 Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downwardpressure
 on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement inproduct
 price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers andbusinesses.
The
 Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services andtechnologies
 to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including thehardware,
 operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. Therecan be no assurance that these
 investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and servicessuccessfully.
The
 Company  currently  holds  a  significant  number  of  patents,  trademarks  and  copyrights  and  has  registered,  and  applied  to  register,  numerous  patents,trademarks
 and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,and
 by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available inevery
 country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or ifcompetitors infringe on the Co
mpany’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.The
 Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition inthese
 markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digitalcontent
 supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base ofactive
 devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors mayhave
 the  resources,  experience  or  cost  structures  to  provide  products  at  little  or  no  profit  or  even  at  a  loss.  Some  of  the  markets  in  which  the  Companycompetes have from time to time expe
rienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally,
 the  Company  faces  significant  competition  as  competitors  imitate  the  Company’s  product  features  and  applications  within  their  products  orcollaborate to
 offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitatethe Company’s approach
 to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The
 Company’s  services  also  face  substantial  competition,  including  from  companies  that  have  significant  resources  and  experience  and  have  establishedservice
 offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competeswith illegitimate means to obt
ain third-party digital content and applications.The
 Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  depend  substantially  on  the  Company’s  ability  to  continually  improve  its  products  and  services  tomaintain
 their  functional  and  design  advantages.  There  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company  will  be  able  to  continue  to  provide  products  and  services  thatcompete effectively.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of productsand services.
Due
 to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products,services
 and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, andsuccessfully
 manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on anumber
 of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associatedwith
 new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments andinventory
 levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand,and
 the risk that new products  and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance theultimate effect of new product and serv
ice introductions and transitions.The Company depends on the performance of ca
rriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The
 Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competingmanufacturers.
 The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sizedbusinesses, and education, enterpri
se and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some
 carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There isno
 assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreementsthe Company enters in
to with new carriers.The
 Company  has  invested  and  will  continue  to  invest  in  programs  to  enhance  reseller  sales,  including  staffing  selected  resellers’  stores  with  Companyemployees
 and  contractors,  and  improving  product  placement  displays.  These  programs  can  require  a  substantial  investment  while  not  assuring  return  orincremental
 sales.  The  financial  condition  of  these  resellers  could  weaken,  these  resellers  could  stop  distributing  the  Company’s  products,  or  uncertaintyregarding demand for some or all of the 
Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.The
 Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellationrisk.
The
 Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated  demand,  or  for  which  costexceeds
 net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Companyreviews
 long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstancesindicate
 the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by whichthe
 carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets andpurchase
 commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other chargesgiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of p
roduct obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The
 Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  Manufacturing  purchaseobligations
 cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s marketsare
 volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess orinsufficient amounts of
 components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 7

Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because
 the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Manycomponents,
 including  those  that  are  available  from  multiple  sources,  are  at  times  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  significant  commodity  pricingfluctuations
 that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements forthe
 supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Component
 suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry,further
 limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economicconditions on the Comp
any’s suppliers, described in “Global and regional eco nomic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, resultsof
 operations, financial condition and growth,”  above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject tosignificant risks of supply short
ages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.The
 Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initialcapacity
 constraints  may exist  until  the  suppliers’  yields have  matured  or  their  manufacturing  capacities  have  increased.  The  continued  availability  of  thesecomponents
 at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of commoncomponents
 instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing productwere
 delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition andoperating
 results  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.  The  Company’s  business  and  financial  performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affecteddepending on the time required to obtain suff
icient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The
 Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing  partners,  many  of  which  arelocated outside of the U.S.
Substantially all
 of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration ofthis
 manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of itstransportation
 and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over productionand distribution.
 Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond tochanging
 conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generallyremains
 responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated productdefect liability. 
While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.The
 Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcingpartners primarily located
 in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have anegative
 impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to finaldestinations
 can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,commercial disputes, military actions, 
economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The
 Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments tocertain
 of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, ifthese
 outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced orterminated, and the recoverabil
ity of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8

The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affectthe Company’s business and result in harm to 
the Company’s reputation.The
 Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operatingsystem
 software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation ofhardware
 or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could makethe
 Company’s  products  unsafe  and  create  a  risk  of  environmental  or  property  damage  and  personal  injury.  These  risks  may  increase  as  the  Company’sproducts are introduced into spec
ialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time totime
 experience  outages,  service  slowdowns  or  errors.  As  a  result,  the  Company’s  services  may  not  perform  as  anticipated  and  may  not  meet  customerexpectations.
 There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers.Failure
 to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can beexposed
 to  product  liability  claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangibleassets, and significant warranty
 and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience forusers
 of  the  Company’s  products  and  services,  and  result  in  harm  to  the  Company’s  reputation,  loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market  acceptance,reduced demand for products and service
s, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.The Company relies on access to third-par
ty digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The
 Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. Thelicensing
 or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of thesearrangements
 on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competingproducts
 and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future.Other
 content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unableto
 continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failureto
 obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a materialadverse impact on th
e Company’s financial condition and operating results.Some
 third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, theCompany may have to develop or l
icense new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license suchsolutions
 at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force theCompany
 to  license  its  digital  rights  management,  which  could  lessen  the  protection  of  content  and  subject  it  to  piracy  and  also  could  negatively  affectarrangements with the
 Company’s content providers.The Company’s future perfor
mance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The
 Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications andservices. There is no assu
rance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products.If
 third-party  software  applications  and  services cease  to  be  developed  and  maintained  for  the  Company’s  products,  customers  may  choose  not  to  buy  theCompany’s products.
The
 Company  believes  the  availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services  for  its  products  depends  in  part  on  the  developers’  perception  andanalysis
 of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’platforms,
 such  as  Android  for  smartphones  and  tablets  and  Windows  for  personal  computers.  This  analysis  may  be  based  on  factors  such  as  the  marketposition
 of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developingsuch applications and services.
The
 Company’s  minority  market  share  in  the  global  smartphone,  personal  computer  and  tablet  markets  could  make  developers  less  inclined  to  develop  orupgrade
 software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products withlarger
 market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices maysuffer.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 9

The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s productsand
 operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change,third-party
 applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result indissatisfied customers.
The
 Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of therevenue
 they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where adeveloper
 offers purchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If developers reduce their use of the Company’s platforms, including in-app
 purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that theCompany retains on such
 sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could bematerially adversely affected.
The
 Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms orat all.
Many
 of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those thirdparties.
 In  addition,  because  of  technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  the  Company  currently  competes  or  in  the  future  may  compete,  currentextensive
 patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents orintellectual
 property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual propertyrights
 of  third  parties.  Based  on  experience  and  industry  practice,  the  Company  believes  licenses  to  such  third-party  intellectual  property  can  generally  beobtained on
 commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms orat
 all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude theCompany from selling certain pr
oducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The
 Company’s financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or governmentinvestigations.
The
 Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have notyet
 been  fully  resolved,  and  new  matters  may  arise  in  the  future.  In  addition,  agreements  entered  into  by  the  Company  sometimes  include  indemnificationprovisions
 which  can  subject  the  Company  to  costs  and  damages  in  the  event  of  a  claim  against  an  indemnified  third  party.  The  number  of  claims,  legalproceedings and
 government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, hasgenerally increased over t
ime and may continue to increase.The
 Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in thefuture.
 For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based onallegations of patent
 infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in severalU.S. jurisdictions, as well as internatio
nally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless
 of  the  merit  of  particular  claims,  defending  against  litigation  or  responding  to  government  investigations  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming,disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of
 these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or otherarrangements
 to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or thatlitigation will not occur. These 
agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses.Except
 as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” underthe heading
 “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or amaterial
 loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement ofintellectual property rights.
The outcome of litigation or govern
ment investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnifiedthird party
 in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting periodcould
 be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgementof
 revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and could require the Company to change its business practices orlimit the Company’s ability to off
er certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.While
 the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types ofclaims that may arise.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10

The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increasedcosts and other adverse effects on the Co
mpany’s business.The
 Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, datasecurity and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;
digital
 platforms;  Internet,  telecommunications,  and  mobile  communications;  media,  television,  film  and  digital  content;  availability  of  third-party  softwareapplications
 and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign owner
ship and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety.Compliance
 with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations. Changes tolaws
 and  regulations  can  adversely  affect  the  Company’s  business  by  increasing  the  Company’s  costs,  limiting  the  Company’s  ability  to  offer  a  product  orservice
 to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services lessattractive
 to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but therecan be
 no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures.If
 the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operatingresults.
The
 technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Companyto
 government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around theworld,
 which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact onthe
 Company’s financial condition and operating results. In addition, if enacted, legislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies couldresult in changes to 
the Company’s business, including requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings, limiting the Company’s ability to investin
 strategic acquisitions, or affecting the Company’s business relationships with other technology companies, and could have a materially adverse impact on theCompany’s
 financial condition and operating results. Further, the Company’s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved againstthem,
 could affect the Company’s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition andoperating
 results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by theoutcomes of such investigation
s, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.The
 Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject tonumerous risks and uncertainties.
The
 Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel.The Company
 also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venuesto
 promote  brand  awareness.  Because  of  their  unique  design  elements,  locations  and  size,  these  stores  require  substantially  more  investment  than  theCompany’s
 more  typical  retail  stores.  Due  to  the  high  cost  structure  associated  with  the  Company’s  retail  stores,  a  decline  in  sales  or  the  closure  or  poorperformance
 of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, couldresult in signifi
cant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.The Company’s retail operations
 are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition andoperating
 results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, theCompany’s
 ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costsassociated with fluctuat
ions in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Investment
 in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplatedand adversely affect the Company’s reputa
tion, financial condition and operating results.The
 Company  has  invested,  and  in  the  future  may  invest,  in  new  business  strategies  or  acquisitions.  Such  endeavors  may  involve  significant  risks  anduncertainties,
 including  distraction  of  management  from  current  operations,  greater-than-expected  liabilities  and  expenses,  economic,  political,  legal  andregulatory
 challenges  associated  with  operating  in  new  businesses,  regions  or  countries,  inadequate  return  on  capital,  potential  impairment  of  tangible  andintangible
 assets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment couldadversely affect the Company’
s reputation, financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11

The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.The
 Company  is  exposed  to  information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions  caused  by  natural  disasters,  accidents,  power  disruptions,telecommunications
 failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy andother
 continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for alleventualities.
 Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s onlineservices,
 interfering  with  customer  transactions  or  impeding  the  manufacturing  and  shipping  of  the  Company’s  products.  These  events  could  materiallyadversely affect the Company’
s reputation, financial condition and operating results.There
 may  be  losses  or  unauthorized  access  to  or  releases  of  confidential  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  that  couldsubject the Company to significant reputational, 
financial, legal and operational consequences.The
 Company’s  business  requires  it  to  use  and  store  confidential  information  including,  among  other  things,  personally  identifiable  information  (“PII”)  withrespect
 to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use ofencryption
 and  other  security  measures  intended  to  protect  its  systems  and  data.  But  these  measures  cannot  provide  absolute  security,  and  losses  orunauthorized
 access to or releases of confidential  information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation,  financial condition andoperating results.
The
 Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secureconfidential
 information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidentialinformation occur and c
ould materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.For
 example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality,integrity or
 availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for itsproducts
 and  services,  impact  the  Company’s  stock  price,  materially  damage  supplier  relationships,  and  expose  the  Company  to  litigation  or  governmentinvestigations, which could result
 in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.Although
 malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Companyis
 at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores andprocesses.
The
 Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss ofsensitive data,
 including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient forall
 eventualities  and  may  be  vulnerable  to  hacking,  employee  error,  malfeasance,  system  error,  faulty  password  management  or  other  irregularities.  Forexample,
 third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, beused
 to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systemsfor
 unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders orimpede customer access t
o the Company’s products and services.In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to
 specific obligations relating to health data andpayment
 card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit bygovernmental
 authorities  regarding  the  Company’s  compliance  with  these  obligations.  If  the  Company  fails  to  adequately  comply  with  these  rules  andrequirements, or
 if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company couldbe subject to litigation 
or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.Under
 payment  card  rules  and  obligations,  if  cardholder  information  is  potentially  compromised,  the  Company  could  be  liable  for  associated  investigatoryexpenses
 and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could alsoexperience
 a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry datasecurity standards, which would
 materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.While the Company mainta
ins insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficientto cover all losses or all types
 of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 12

The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The
 Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these lawsapply
 not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions havepassed
 laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent fromjurisdiction
 to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require theCompany to change its
 business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The
 Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Anyfailure by
 the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulationscould
 result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing auditrequirements and significan
t legal liability.The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key pe
rsonnel.Much
 of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive teamand
 other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especiallyin Silicon Valley, where most of t
he Company’s key personnel are located.The
 Company’s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,industrial accidents and other business interruptions.
Political
 events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions couldharm
 or  disrupt  international  commerce  and  the  global  economy,  and  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company  and  its  customers,  suppliers,contract manufactur
ers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.The
 Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. International trade disputescan
 result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensionsbetween
 the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions.Tariffs
 may increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adverselyimpact
 the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which couldmake
 the  Company’s  products  less  competitive  and  reduce  consumer  demand.  Countries  may  also  adopt  other  measures,  such  as  controls  on  imports  orexports
 of  goods,  technology  or  data,  that  could  adversely  impact  the  Company’s  operations  and  supply  chain  and  limit  the  Company’s  ability  to  offer  itsproducts
 and  services  as  designed.  These  measures  can  require  the  Company  to  take  various  actions,  including  change  suppliers,  restructure  businessrelationships,
 and  stop  offering  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the  Company’s  operations  in  accordance  with  new  or  changed  traderestrictions
 may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. Trade restrictions may be announcedwith
 little  or  no  advance  notice  and  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  Political  uncertaintysurrounding
 international trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’sbusiness.
Many
 of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locationsthat
 are  prone  to  earthquakes  and  other  natural  disasters.  In  addition,  such  operations  and  facilities  are  subject  to  the  risk  of  interruption  by  fire,  powershortages,
 nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, includingpandemics
 such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of naturaldisasters
 occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliverproducts
 to  its  customers,  create  delays  and  inefficiencies  in  the  Company’s  supply  and  manufacturing  chain,  and  result  in  slowdowns  and  outages  to  theCompany’s service
 offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expendituresto
 resume  operations,  and  lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  criticalcomponents, a business interrupt
ion affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13

The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers arerequired
 to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business andharm
 to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in thefuture
 adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safetymeasures,
 such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions inthe
 Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps ofnew products.
While the Company maintains insur
ance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.The Company expects its quarterly net sales and ope
rating results to fluctuate.The
 Company’s  profit  margins  vary  across  its  products,  services,  geographic  segments  and  distribution  channels.  For  example,  the  gross  margins  on  theCompany’s
 products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressuredue
 to  a  variety  of  factors,  including:  continued  industry-wide  global  product  pricing  pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  inresponse
 to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressedproduct
 life  cycles;  potential  increases  in  the  cost  of  components,  outside  manufacturing  services,  and  developing,  acquiring  and  delivering  content  for  theCompany’s
 services;  the  Company’s  ability  to  manage  product  quality  and  warranty  costs  effectively;  shifts  in  the  mix  of  products  and  services,  or  in  thegeographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the
 introduction of new products or services, including new products or serviceswith higher cost structure
s. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The
 Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holidaydemand.
 Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Companygenerates
 a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. TheCompany
 could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with newproduct
 or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,or manufacturing partners.
The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.
The
 Company’s  stock  price  has  experienced  substantial  price  volatility  in  the  past  and  may  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Additionally,  the  Company,  thetechnology
 industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways thatmay
 have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Companyrepurchases
 its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth andprofitability.
 The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that itscurrent
 share  repurchase  program  will  be  fully  consummated.  Future  dividends  are  subject  to  declaration  by  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  and  theCompany’s
 share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to futuregrowth,
 profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverseimpact on investor confidence and e
mployee retention.The Company’s financial performance is subject 
to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The
 Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operatingexpenses
 worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign supplierscould be materially adve
rsely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of
 foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales andearnings,
 and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, forcompetitive
 or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affectthe U.S. dollar value of the gros
s margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14

Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated salesand
 earnings,  could  cause  the  Company  to  reduce  international  pricing  and  incur  losses  on  its  foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  thebenefit.
 Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the  Company’s  cost  of  product  components  denominated  in  those  currencies,  thusadversely affecting gross
 margins.The
 Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange
 rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorablemovements in foreign exchange rates o
ver the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in 
the values of its investment portfolio.The
 Company’s  investments  can  be  negatively  affected  by  liquidity,  credit  deterioration,  financial  results,  market  and  economic  conditions,  political  risk,sovereign
 risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable
 securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, andmarketable
 and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on theCompany’s financial condition an
d operating results.The
 Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supplyagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when econo
mic conditions worsen.The
 Company  distributes  its products  through  third-party  cellular  network  carriers,  wholesalers,  retailers  and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells its productsdirectly
 to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding tradereceivables
 are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’strade
 receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its tradereceivables
 is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-tradereceivables resulting
 from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products forthe
 Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As ofSeptember
 26, 2020, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a fewindividual
 vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-tradereceivables, as well as long-term 
prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The
 Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional taxliabilities.
The Company is subject to taxes in the
 U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.Due
 to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could beaffected
 by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  theintroduction of new taxes, or changes 
in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.The
 Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities andgovernmental
 bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy ofits provision
 for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly inthe
 U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’sfinancial condition and o
perating results could be materially adversely affected.Item 1B.    Unresolved

Item 2.    Properties
The
 Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 26, 2020, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporatefunctions,
 R&D,  data  centers,  retail  and  other  purposes  at  locations  throughout  the  U.S.  and  in  various  places  outside  the  U.S.  The  Company  believes  itsexisting facilit

Item 3.    Legal ProceedingsThe
 Company  is  subject  to  legal  proceedings  and  claims  that  have  not  been  fully  resolved  and  that  have  arisen  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  TheCompany’s
 material  legal  proceedings  are  described  in  Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Note  10,“Commitments and Contingencies”
 under the heading “Contingencies.”The
 outcome  of  litigation  is  inherently  uncertain.  If  one  or  more  legal  matters  were  resolved  against  the  Company  in  a  reporting  period  for  amounts  abovemanagement’s
 expectations,  the  Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.  TheCompany settled
 certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2020 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financialcondition or operating
 results.Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures

Fiscal Year Highlights
COVID-19 Update
COVID-19
 has spread rapidly throughout  the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented  measures in response. Such measureshave
 included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19pandemic has
 significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemicand
 the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business,results of operations,
 financial condition and stock price.During
 2020, aspects of the Company’s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well aschannel
 partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company hasreopened
 some of its offices and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employeesand customers, and it continues to wo
rk on safely re-opening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations.The full extent of the
 future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend onmany
 factors  outside  the  Company’s  control,  including,  without  limitation,  the  timing,  extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  development  andavailability of
 effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy anddemand for consumer products. Refer to Pa
rt I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information.The
 Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidityarrangements,
 will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidityrequirements associated with
 its existing operations.Fiscal 2020 Highlights
Total
 net  sales  increased  6%  or  $14.3  billion  during  2020  compared  to  2019,  primarily  driven  by  higher  net  sales  of  Services  and  Wearables,  Home  andAccessories. The weaknes
s in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2020.In
 April  2020,  the  Company  announced  an  increase  to  its  current  share  repurchase  program  authorization  from  $175  billion  to  $225  billion  and  raised  itsquarterly dividend
 from $0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in May 2020. During 2020, the Company repurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paiddividends and dividend equi
valents of $14.1 billion.On
 August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, RSU and per share or per RSUinformation has been

The
 year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe thatfocused
 investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated productsand services that are
 central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling, General and Administra

 Company’s effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreignearnings, including the i
mpact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.The
 Company’s  effective  tax  rate  for  2020  was  lower  compared  to  2019  due  primarily  to  a  one-time  adjustment  of  U.S.  foreign  tax  credits  in  response  toregulations
 issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019 in connection with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) and highertax benefits from sh
are-based compensation.As
 of September 26, 2020, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of $11.0 billion and deferredtax liabilities of
 $2.8 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certaintax
 planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. TheCompany will cont
inue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.Recent Accounting Pronouncements

As  of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $18.6 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, that was restrictedfrom
 general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 ofthis Form 10-K) and other agreements.
The
 Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidityarrangements,
 will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidityrequirements associated w
ith its existing operations over the next 12 months.In
 connection with the State Aid Decision, as of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded intoescrow, where it will remain restricted fr
om general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Further information regarding the State Aid Decision canbe found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K 
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.”The
 Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potentialrisk
 of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any oneissuer.
During
 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $80.7 billion was a result of $57.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6billion
 and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $5.7 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $4.3 billion during 2020 consistedprimarily
 of cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and cash  paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $1.5  billion,partially
 offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $5.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $86.8 billionduring
 2020 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $72.4 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion,cash
 used  to  repay  or  redeem  term  debt  of  $12.6  billion  and  net  repayments  of  commercial  paper  of  $1.0  billion,  partially  offset  by  net  proceeds  from  theissuance of term deb
t of $16.1 billion.During
 2019, cash generated by operating activities of $69.4 billion was a result of $55.3 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6billion,
 partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billionduring 2019
 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5 billion, partially offset by cash used toacquire
 property,  plant  and  equipment  of  $10.5  billion.  Cash  used  in  financing  activities  of  $91.0  billion  during  2019  consisted  primarily  of  cash  used  torepurchase common stock
 of $66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt of $8.8 billion andnet repayments of commercial pape

The
 Company  issues  unsecured  short-term  promissory  notes  (“Commercial  Paper”)  pursuant  to  a  commercial  paper  program.  The  Company  uses  the  netproceeds
 from  the  commercial  paper  program  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including  dividends  and  share  repurchases.  As  of  September  26,  2020,  theCompany had $5.0 billion of 
Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.62% and maturities generally less than nine months.The
 Company may enter into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amountas an additional short-
term liquidity arrangement.(1)Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 25

As of September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.1billion
 (collectively the “Notes”). During 2020, the Company issued $16.1 billion and repaid or redeemed $12.6 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, andin
 the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter,into foreign currency swaps
 to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes.Further

The
 Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. The Company’sretail store and
 other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractualobligations
 table  includes  future  payments  under  leases  that  had  commenced  as  of  September  26,  2020,  and  were  therefore  recorded  on  the  Company’sConsolidated
 Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of September 26, 2020. Further information regarding theCompany’s leases can be found 
in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Leases.”Manufacturing Purchase
 ObligationsThe
 Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing offinished
 products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typicallycovers periods up to 150 days. The Compan
y also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.Other Purchase Obligations
The
 Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing processequipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other
 activities.(1)Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26

Deemed Repatriation Tax PayableAs
 of  September  26,  2020,  a  significant  portion  of  the  other  non-current  liabilities  in  the  Company’s  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  consisted  of  the  deemedrepatriation tax payable impo
sed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.Other Non-Current Liabilities
The
 Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of thetiming or amount of payments; therefore, su
ch amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.Critical Accounting Po
licies and EstimatesThe
 preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’sdiscussion and
 analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates thataffect
 the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of thisForm
 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Managementbases
 its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which formthe
 basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may bematerial.
Management
 believes the Company’s critical accounting  policies and estimates are those related to revenue  recognition, valuation of manufacturing-relatedassets
 and  estimation  of  inventory  purchase  commitment  cancellation  fees,  warranty  costs,  income  taxes,  and  legal  and  other  contingencies.  Managementconsiders
 these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they requiremanagement
 to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accountingpolicies and related disclosures with
 the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.Revenue Recognition
The
 Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain otherproducts.
 The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software deliveredat
 the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. Thethird
 performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled witheach
 device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices(“SSPs”).
 Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’sestimated
 SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the esti
mated period they are expected to be provided.The
 Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time dependingupon the unique facts and
 circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate ofrelated
 amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factorssubject
 to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and theestimated period they are expected to be prov
ided.Valuation of Manufacturing-Related 
Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation FeesThe Company invests
 in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliersassociated
 with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees relatedto
 inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for itsproducts
 are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellationfee
 accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s productdevelopment plans, or
 an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of ma
nufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27

Warranty CostsThe
 Company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and customersmay
 purchase  extended  service  coverage,  where  available,  on  many  of  the  Company’s  hardware  products.  The  Company  accrues  the  estimated  cost  ofwarranties
 in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim andknowledge
 of specific product failures outside the Company’s typical experience. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions tothe estimated warranty
 liabilities would be required.Income Taxes
The
 Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxingauthorities, based on
 the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on thelargest
 benefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment inestimating
 the  impact  of  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  GAAP  and  complex  tax  laws.  Resolution  of  these  uncertainties  in  a  manner  inconsistent  withmanagement’s expectations could ha
ve a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other Contingencies
As
 discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial
 Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinarycourse of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has
 been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determinationof
 which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10,“Commitments
 and  Contingencies”  under  the  heading  “Contingencies,”  in  the  opinion  of  management,  there  was  not  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility  theCompany
 may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and otherclaims.
The
 outcome  of  litigation  is  inherently  uncertain.  If  one  or  more  legal  matters  were  resolved  against  the  Company  in  a  reporting  period  for  amounts  abovemanagement’s expectations, the Compan
y’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosu
res About Market RiskInterest Rate and Foreign Cur
rency Risk ManagementThe
 Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction withits underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of
 the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory natureof
 the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreignexchange
 or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and lossesrelated to the underlying economi
c exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Interest Rate Risk
The
 Company’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  the  Company’s  investment  portfolio  and  outstanding  debt.  While  the  Company  isexposed to global interest rate flu
ctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S.interest
 rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well ascosts associated with hedg
ing and interest paid on the Company’s debt.The
 Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Companyuses
 a  combination  of  internal  and  external  management  to  execute  its  investment  strategy  and  achieve  its  investment  objectives.  The  Company  typicallyinvests in
 highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requiressecurities
 to be  investment  grade and limits the  amount  of credit exposure  to  any one issuer. To provide  a meaningful  assessment  of the  interest rate riskassociated with the Company
’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would haveon the value of the
 investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 26, 2020 andSeptember
 28, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion incrementaldecline in the fair market
 value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28

As  of  September  26,  2020  and  September  28,  2019,  the  Company  had  outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an  aggregatecarrying
 amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manageinterest
 rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments orfloating-rate
 payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  term  debt  are  generally  offset  by  the  corresponding  losses  and  gains  on  the  relatedhedging
 instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 26, 2020 andSeptember 28, 2019 to increase by $218 mi
llion and $325 million on an annualized basis, respectively.Foreign Currency Risk
In
 general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening ofthe
 U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have toadjust local currency pricing du
e to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.The
 Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated withcertain
 existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,the
 Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on itsforeign
 currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenueand
 inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety ofreasons including, but not l
imited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.To
 provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed asensitivity
 analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using aMonte Carlo simulation to
 generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fairvalue,
 for  a  given  confidence  interval,  to  the  Company’s  foreign  currency  derivative  positions  due  to  adverse  movements  in  rates.  The  VAR  model  is  notintended
 to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilitiesdenominated
 in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximumone-day
 loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28,2019.
 Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offsetby increases in the fair va
lue of the underlying exposures.Actual
 future  gains  and  losses  associated  with  the  Company’s  investment  portfolio,  debt  and  derivative  positions  may  differ  materially  from  the  sensitivityanalyses
 performed as of September 26, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,foreign currency exchange rates and the 
Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 29

Apple Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Summary of Significan
t Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation
 and PreparationThe consolidated fina
ncial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompanyaccounts
 and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments,which
 are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements andaccompanying
 notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect theamounts
 reported.  Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  those  estimates.  Certain  prior  period  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  andaccompanying notes have been reclas
sified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The
 Company’s  fiscal  year  is  the  52-  or  53-week  period  that  ends  on  the  last  Saturday  of  September.  The  Company’s  fiscal  years  2020,  2019  and  2018spanned
 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendarquarters.
 Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and theassociated quarters, months and period
s of those fiscal years.Common Stock Split
On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stoc
k split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) andper share or per RSU infor
mation has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.Recently Adopted Acco
unting PronouncementsLeases
At
 the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update(“ASU”)
 No. 2016-02, Leases  (Topic 842) (“ASU  2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the“new
 leases standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities foroperating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted
 the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospectivetransition
 method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to notreassess
 (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $8
.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.Hedging
At
 the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives  and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements toAccounting
 for  Hedging  Activities (“ASU  2017-12”).  ASU  2017-12  expands  component  and  fair  value  hedging,  specifies  the  presentation  of  the  effects  ofhedging
 instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging.The
 Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase inaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  (“AOCI”)  and  a  corresponding  decrease  in  retained  earnings  in  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Statement  ofShareholders’ Equity.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expe
nsed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Share-Based Compensation
The
 Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizesexpense
 on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be foundin Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”

$ 3.31 $ 2.99 $ 3.00 Diluted earnings per share
$ 3.28 $ 2.97 $ 2.98 The
 Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 62million shares of co
mmon stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
All highly liquid investments with maturities 
of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.The
 Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketabledebt
 securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketabledebt securities classified as av
ailable-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).The Company’s investments 
in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations.The Company’s marketable equ
ity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).The cost of securities sold 
is determined using the specific identification method.Inventories
Inventories are measured using the f
irst-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and Equipment
Depreciation
 on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is thelesser
 of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one  and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturingprocess equipment; and
 the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on astraight-line
 basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three  to  seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property andequipment was $9.7 bill
ion, $11.3 billion and $9.3 billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Non-cash
 investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of$(2.9) billion and $3.4
 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 37

Non-Marketable SecuritiesThe
 Company  has elected  to  apply  the  measurement  alternative  to  equity  securities  without  readily determinable  fair values.  As such, the  Company’s  non-marketable
 equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions foridentical or similar investments of 
the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E.Restricted Cash and Restric
ted Marketable SecuritiesThe
 Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restrictedcash
 as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.The
 Company  reports  restricted  marketable  securities  as  current  or  non-current  marketable  securities  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  based  on  theclassification of the und
erlying securities.Fair Value Measurements
The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and
 certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.The
 valuation  techniques  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  the  Company’s  debt  instruments  and  all  other  financial  instruments,  which  generally  havecounterparties
 with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated byobservable market data.
Note 2 – Revenue Recognition
Net
 sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which itexpects
 to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a presentright
 to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’sProducts
 net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered.Payment
 for  Products  and  Services  net  sales  is  collected  within  a  short  period  following  transfer  of  control  or  commencement  of  delivery  of  services,  asapplicable.
The
 Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on theCompany’s expectations an
d historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to
 alldistinct
 performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determineSSPs.
 When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performanceobligations
 would  be  if  they  were  sold  regularly  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  The  Company’s  process  for  estimating  SSPs  without  observable  prices  considersmultiple
 factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, pricescharged
 by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost toprovide the performa
nce obligation.The
 Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain otherproducts.
 The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software deliveredat
 the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. Thethird
 performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled witheach
 device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Companylacks
 observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocatedto
 the  delivered  hardware  and  bundled  software  is  recognized  when  control  has  transferred  to  the  customer,  which  generally  occurs  when  the  product  isshipped.
 Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basisover
 the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warrantycosts,
 are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized ascost of sales as incurred.
For
 certain  long-term  service  arrangements,  the  Company  has  performance  obligations  for  services  it  has  not  yet  delivered.  For  these  arrangements,  theCompany
 does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value ofthe
 undelivered  services.  Accordingly,  the  Company  has  not  recognized  revenue,  and  has  elected  not  to  disclose  amounts,  related  to  these  undeliveredservices.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 38

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenuebased
 on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party productsincluding, but
 not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuringacceptability
 of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital contentstores,
 the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a netbasis by recognizing in Services n
et sales only the commission it retains.The
 Company  has  elected  to  record  revenue  net  of  taxes  collected  from  customers  that  are  remitted  to  governmental  authorities,  with  the  collected  taxesrecorded within other curr
ent liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Deferred Revenue
As of
 September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had total deferred revenue of $10.2 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. As of September 26,2020,
 the Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2%in greater than three years.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, creditrisk, duration and asset al
location. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one  to five years.The
 Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investmentpolicy
 generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for eachindividual
 security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factorssuch
 as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and theCompany’s
 intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 26,2020, the Company does not consider any of it
s marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Non-Marketable Securities
The Company holds non-marketable equ
ity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of September 26, 2020 andSeptember 28, 2019, the Company’s non-mar
ketable equity securities had a carrying value of $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.Restricted Cash

The
 Company  may  use  derivatives  to  partially  offset  its  business  exposure  to  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  risk  on  expected  future  cash  flows,  netinvestments
 in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for avariety
 of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be noassurance the hedges will off
set more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To protect gross margins from f
luctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollarmay hedge a portion of
 forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecastedinventory
 purchases  not  denominated  in  the  subsidiaries’  functional  currencies.  The  Company  may  enter  into  forward  contracts,  option  contracts  or  otherinstruments
 to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreigncurrency exposure associated 
with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To
 protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forwardand
 option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Inaddition,
 the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certainforeign subsidiaries. In both of the
se cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.To
 protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Companymay
 enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurementgains
 or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020,the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketab
le securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years.The Company
 may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated bythe remeasurement 
of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 41

To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter intointerest rate
 swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value.The
 Company  designates  these  instruments  as  either  cash  flow  or  fair  value  hedges.  As  of  September  26,  2020,  the  Company’s  hedged  interest  ratetransactions are expected to be recogni
zed within seven years.Cash Flow Hedges
Cash
 flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.Deferred
 gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as therelated
 revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost ofsales
 in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense arerecognized in
 OI&E in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excludedfrom the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the
 financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life ofthe hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts e
xcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it
 is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur inthe
 initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instrumentsare reclassified
 into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless theyare re-designated as hedges of other transact
ions.Net Investment Hedges
Net
 investment  hedge  amounts  that  are  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  recorded  in  OCI  as  a  part  of  the  cumulative  translationadjustment.
 For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment ofhedge
 effectiveness  and  recognized  in  OCI  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  life  of  the  hedge.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  amounts  excluded  from  theassessment of hedge effectiveness are re
cognized in OCI.Fair Value Hedges
Fair
 value  hedge  gains  and  losses related  to  amounts  that  are  included  in the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  recognized  in earnings  along  with acorresponding
 loss  or  gain  related  to  the  change  in  value  of  the  hedged  item  in  the  same  line  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.  For  foreignexchange
 forward  contracts  designated  as  fair  value  hedges,  the  forward  carry  component  is  excluded  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  andrecognized in OI&E on
 a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognizedin
 OI&E were gains of $465 million and $777 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment ofhedge effectiveness
 are recognized in OCI.Non-Designated Derivatives
Derivatives that
 are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivativerelates.
The
 Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments isbased
 on  its  hedge  designation.  The  following  tables  show  the  Company’s  derivative  instruments  at  gross  fair  value  as  of  September  26,  2020  andSeptember 28, 20

 that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency orinterest
 rates  at  each  respective  date.  The  Company’s  exposure  to  credit  loss  and  market  risk  will  vary  over  time  as  currency  and  interest  rates  change.Although

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with thesame
 counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received orposted
 when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assetsand derivative
 liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateralreceived
 by  the  Company  related  to  derivative  instruments  under  its  collateral  security  arrangements  was  $875  million  and  $1.6  billion,  respectively.  TheCompany includes gross collateral 
posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.Under
 master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactionswith
 a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-offassociated
 with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of$2.8 billion and $2.7
 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $312 million and $407 million, respectively.Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The
 Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sizedbusinesses
 and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;  however,  theCompany
 will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limitcredit risk on trade
 receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. Thesecredit-financing
 arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assumeany recourse or credit ri
sk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As
 of both September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables.The Company’s cellu
lar network carriers accounted for 51% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019.Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The
 Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacturesub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of
 September 26, 2020, theCompany
 had  two  vendors  that  individually  represented  10%  or  more  of  total  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  which  accounted  for  57%  and  11%.  As  ofSeptember

 Company  is  subject  to  taxation  and  files  income  tax  returns  in  the  U.S.  federal  jurisdiction  and  many  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  The  U.S.  InternalRevenue
 Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remainopen
 in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has beenmade for any adjustments that may result from
 tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressedin
 the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxesin
 the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible thatits gross unrecognized tax benef
its could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $3.9 billion.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47

Interest and PenaltiesThe
 Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28,2019,
 the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penaltyexpense in 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $85 million, $73 
million and $489 million, respectively.European Commission State
 Aid DecisionOn
 August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and2007
 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision orderedIreland
 to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as ofJanuary 2015,
 eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2billion.
 The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). OnJuly 15,
 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision tothe
 European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision wouldbe creditable against U.S. taxe
s, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.On

2014 Employee Stock Plan
In
 the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant newawards
 under  the  2003  Employee  Stock  Plan  (the  “2003  Plan”).  The  2014  Plan  provides  for  broad-based  equity  grants  to  employees,  including  executiveofficers, and permits
 the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards.RSUs
 granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’scommon
 stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of twotimes
 the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grantunder
 the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan havedividend
 equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to thesame
 vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Uponapproval
 of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 1.54 billion shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003Plan.
 Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholdingobligations
 for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 808 million shares were reserved forfuture issuance under the 2014 Plan.
Apple Inc. Non-Employ
ee Director Stock PlanThe
 Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs orstock
 options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board ofDirectors
 and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change thevalue
 and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of theCompany’s
 common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUsgranted
 under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. TheDirector
 Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and otherterms
 and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26, 2020,approximately 4 million shares were r
eserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.(1)Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 51

cquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The
 Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (the  “Purchase  Plan”)  is  a  shareholder-approved  plan  under  which  substantially  all  employees  may  purchase  theCompany’s common stock
 through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end ofsix-month
 offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees maynot
 purchase  more  than  $25,000  of  stock  during  any  calendar  year.  As  of  September  26,  2020,  approximately  107  million  shares  were  reserved  for  futureissuance under the Purchase Plan.

 iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certainconditions
 are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right,with subsequent changes to the guarantee liab
ility recognized within net sales.Concentrations in the Available Sources of 
Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle
 or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,tablets
 and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject to industry-wide shor
tage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The
 Company  uses  some  custom  components  that  are  not  commonly  used  by  its  competitors,  and  new  products  introduced  by  the  Company  often  utilizecustom
 components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  thesuppliers’
 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,may
 be  affected  if  suppliers  decide  to  concentrate  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  of  components  customized  to  meet  the  Company’srequirements.
The Company
 has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew these agreements on simi
lar terms, or at all.Substantially
 all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computersmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.

 of  litigation  is  inherently  uncertain.  If  one  or  more  legal  matters  were  resolved  against  the  Company  in  a  reporting  period  for  amounts  abovemanagement’s
 expectations,  the  Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.  In  theopinion

VirnetX,
 Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11,2018,
 a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe Federal Circuit, which remanded the
 case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled for a re-trial in October 2020.The
 Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declaredthe patents invalid, subject to furthe

Various
 civil litigation matters  have been  filed in state and  federal courts  in the  U.S. and  in various  international  jurisdictions alleging violation  of consumerprotection
 laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operatingsystems,
 introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018,several
 U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ofCalifornia
 (the  “Northern  California District Court”).  On  February  28,  2020,  the  parties  in  the  Multidistrict Litigation  reached  a  settlement  to  resolve  the  U.S.federal and
 California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, theCompany
 has  agreed  to  pay  up  to  $500  million  in  the  aggregate  to  certain  U.S.  owners  of  iPhones  if  certain  conditions  are  met.  The  final  amount  of  thesettlement
 will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the Company has agreed to payat least $310 million to sett
le the claims. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for informationrelating
 to the performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance managementfeature
 introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make anymisleading statements or fa
il to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.French Competition Authority
On
 March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in Franceviolate French competition

raphic DataThe
 Company  reports  segment  information  based  on  the  “management”  approach.  The  management  approach  designates  the  internal  reporting  used  bymanagement for making decision
s and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The
 Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,Japan
 and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East andAfrica.
 Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in theCompany’s
 other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one ismanaged
 separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographicregion. The accounting polic
ies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based
 on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generallybased
 on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segmentincludes net
 sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally includedin
 the  geographic  segment  in  which  the  expenditures  are  incurred.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  excludes  other  income  and  expense  and  certainexpenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from
 segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research anddevelopment,
 corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separatelymanaged general and administrati
ve costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.The following table show

Note 12 – Leases
The
 Company  has  lease  arrangements  for  certain  equipment  and  facilities,  including  retail,  corporate,  manufacturing  and  data  center  space.  These  leasestypically
 have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. TheCompany’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The
 Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-leasecomponents as a single lease co
mponent for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.Payments
 under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of theunderlying
 leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $1.5 billion for 2020. Lease costs associatedwith
 variable  payments  on  the  Company’s  leases  were $9.3  billion for  2020.  Rent  expense  for  operating  leases,  as  previously  reported  under  former  leaseaccounting standards, was $1.3 bi
llion and $1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.For 2020, the Company made $1.5 bill
ion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained in exchange forlease liabilit
ies were $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020. (1)(1)

 of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, andthe related notes (collecti
vely referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financialposition
 of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod ended Sept
ember 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the
 standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internalcontrol
 over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal  Control – Integrated Framework issued  by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tread
way Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These
 financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statementsbased
 on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordancewith the U.S. federal secur
ities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether the financial statements are free of
 material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
 or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
 and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluatingthe
 accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Webelieve that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The
 critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required tobe
 communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  ourespecially
 challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financialstatements,
 taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or onthe account or disclosur
e to which it relates.Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of the Matter
As discussed in
 Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns inthe
 U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 26, 2020, the total amountof
 gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was  $16.5  billion,  of  which  $8.8  billion,  if  recognized,  would  impact  AppleInc.’s
 effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating theimpact of uncertainties in the app
lication of technical merits and complex tax laws.Auditing
 management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustainedand the measurement of
 the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and isbased on interpretations of tax law
s and legal rulings.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 59

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We  tested  controls  relating  to  the  evaluation  of  uncertain  tax  positions,  including  controls  over  management’sassessment
 as  to  whether  tax  positions  are  more  likely  than  not  to  be  sustained,  management’s  process  tomeasure the benefit of its tax posit
ions, and the development of the related disclosures.To
 evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our auditprocedures
 included,  among  others,  reading  and  evaluating  management’s  assumptions  and  analysis,  and,  asapplicable,
 Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of theuncertain
 tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certainof
 Apple  Inc.’s  tax  positions  based  on  our  knowledge  of  relevant  tax  laws  and  experience  with  related  taxingauthorities.
 For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussedthe
 matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosurein relation to these matters in
cluded in Note 5 to the financial statements./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

rtingWe
 have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal  Control – IntegratedFramework
 issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, AppleInc. maintained, in all mate
rial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidatedbalance
 sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,shareholders’ equity and cash flows for
 each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated October 29,2020 expressed an unqualified opin
ion thereon.Basis for Opinion
Apple
 Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol
 over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress
 an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required
 to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whe
ther effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  andevaluating
 the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circum
stances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company arebeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
 directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention ortimely detection of unauthorized a
cquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.
Item 9A.    Controls an
d ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and P
roceduresBased
 on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principalfinancial
 officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Actwere
 effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files orsubmits
 under  the  Exchange  Act  is  (i)  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and(ii) accumulated and
 communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allowtimely decisions regarding require
d disclosure.Inherent Limitations
 over Internal ControlsThe
 Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internalcontrol over financial repor
ting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’sassets;
(ii)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  withGAAP,
 and  that  the  Company’s  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  the  Company’smanagement and directors; and
(iii)
provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assetsthat could have a material effect on the finan
cial statements.Management,
 including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent ordetect
 all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that theobjectives
 of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits ofcontrols
 must  be  considered  relative  to  their  costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  internal  controls  can  provideabsolute
 assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in futureperiods
 are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Inte
rnal Control over Financial ReportingThe
 Company’s management  is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate  internal control over financial reporting  (as defined  in Rule 13a-15(f)under
 the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on thecriteria
 set  forth  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013framework).
 Based  on  the  Company’s  assessment,  management  has  concluded  that  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofSeptember
 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordancewith
 GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal controlover financial reporting, 
which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial 
ReportingThere
 were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020, which were identified in connection withmanagement’s evaluation
 required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likelyto materially affect, t

ing. However, the Notes are structurally subordinated to any indebtedness and preferred stock, if any, of oursubsidiaries and are effect
ively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Claims of thecreditors of our subsidiaries 
generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors, including holdersof the Notes. Accordingly, the 
Notes are effectively subordinated to creditors, including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any, of our subsidiaries. TheIndentures do not restrict our abil
ity or that of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness.Payment on the Notes

may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the applicable Indenture with respect to the Notes ofthat series, except a default (1) in the pa

ied or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any such waiver, such defaultwill cease to exi
st, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiverwill extend to any subsequent or othe
r default or event of default or impair any rights consequent thereon.Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
We may discharge certain ob
ligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and thateither have become due and payable or w
ill become due and payable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with thetrustee, in trust, funds in U.S. do
llars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and premium, if any, andinterest to the date of such deposit (if due and payab
le) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. Wemay direct the trustee to invest su
ch funds in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities.
The Indentures provide that we may elect e
ither (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes of a series(except for, among other things, obligat
ions to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes,to maintain an office or agency w
ith respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (“legal defeasance”) or (2) to be released from our obligationsto comply with the restr
ictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an eventof default with respect to the Notes of a se
ries and clauses (3) and (6) under the caption “Events of Default” above will no longer be applied (“covenantdefeasance”). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, a
s the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us withthe trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. do
llars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that serieswhich through the scheduled payment of pr
incipal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal orpremium, if any, and interest on the 
Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.If we effect covenant defeasance with respe
ct to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term ismodified below), or both, on depos
it with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amountsdue on the Notes of that series at the time of the stated matu
rity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of theacceleration resulting f
rom such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration.With respect to the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000
% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029Notes and the 2031 Notes, the term “U.S. gove
rnment obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the German government or(ii) an obligation of a per
son controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German government the payment of which is fully andunconditionally guaranteed by the Ger
man government or the central bank of the German government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable orredeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (
y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest inobligations described in clause
 (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof.With respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 
Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a directobligation of the United Kingdo
m government or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of theUnited Kingdom government the payment of 
which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of the UnitedKingdom government, which, 
in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receiptsor other instruments which
 evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interestpayments due in respect thereof.
We will be requi
red to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance will not cause the holders and beneficialowners of the Notes of that series to re
cognize income, gain or loss for13

federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or achange in law to that effect.
We may exercise our lega
l defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option.Book-Entry and Settlement
The Notes were issued in book
-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary on behalf ofEuroclear and Clearstrea
m, and are registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not beissued in exchange for
 beneficial interests in the global notes.Certificated Notes
Subject to certain condition
s, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor, inminimum denominations of €100,000 p
rincipal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 
Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, and in minimum denominations of£100,000 principal amount and integra

ccessor depository within 90 days;2.    we determine that the Notes wi
ll no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to that effect; or3.    an event of default with respect to the Notes 
will have occurred and be continuing.Any Note that is exchangeable as above 
is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names asthe common depositary shall d
irect. Subject to the foregoing, a global note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination tobe registered in the name of the common depos
itary or its nominee.The Trustee for the Notes
The Bank of New York Mel
lon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee under the Indentures. We have commercial deposits and custodial arrangements withThe Bank of New York Mellon
 Trust Company, N.A. and its affiliates (“BNYM”). We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the futurein the normal course of busines
s. In addition, BNYM acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities issued by us, and may do so forfuture issuances of 
debt securities by us as well.14

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
1.
General .  These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “Terms ”)  apply to a particular restricted stock unitaward (the “
Award ”)  granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company ”),  and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant (the“
Grant Notice”)  corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Participant .” The
 effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date .”  The Award was granted under and issubject
 to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “Plan ”).  Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein.The
 Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwisepayable
 or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement ”  applicable to theAward.
2.
    Stock Units.  As used herein, the term “Stock Unit ”  shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeepingpurposes
 to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company’s Common Stock (“Share ”)  solely for purposes of the Plan and this AwardAgreement.
 The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if suchStock Units vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.
3.
    Vesting.  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Eachvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “
Vesting Date. ”) 4.
    Continuance of Employment.  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continuedactive
 employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and therights
 and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Vesting Commencement Dateand
 the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionatevesting
 of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (otherthan
 a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by theCompany, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shal
l be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.Nothing
 contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects theParticipant’s
 status  as an employee at will who is subject  to termination  with or without cause, confers upon the Participant  any right  to remainemployed
 by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time toterminate
 such  employment  or  service,  or  affects  the  right  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  to  increase  or  decrease  the  Participant’s  othercompensation
 or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participantwithout his or her consent thereto.

5.    Dividend and Voting Rights. (a)
    Limitations on Rights Associated with Stock Units.  The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company,no
 dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to theStock
 Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by theParticipant.
 No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of thestock certificate or book entry evidencing such Shares.
(b)
    Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares,the
 Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on suchdate,
 multiplied by (ii) the total number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award thatare
 outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend  Equivalent Right”).  Any Dividend Equivalent Rights creditedpursuant
 to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictionsas
 the original Stock Units to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of anyvested
 Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) withrespect
 to any Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminatedpursuant to Section 8.
6.
    Restrictions on Transfer.  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interesttherein
 or  amount  or  Shares  payable  in  respect  thereof  shall  not  be  sold,  assigned,  transferred,  pledged  or  otherwise  disposed  of,  alienated  orencumbered, either voluntarily or involuntari
ly.7.
    Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units.  On or as soon as administratively practical following each vesting event pursuant toSection
 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to theParticipant
 a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, asdetermined
 by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that vest on the applicable Vesting Date, lessTax-Related
 Items (as defined in Section 11 below), unless such Stock Units terminate prior to the given Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. TheCompany’s
 obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that theParticipant
 or  other  person  entitled  under  the  Plan  to  receive  any  Shares  with  respect  to  the  vested  Stock  Units  deliver  to  the  Company  anyrepresentations
 or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights withrespect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.
8.
    Effect of Termination of Service. Except  as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s Stock Units (as well asthe
 related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such Stock Units have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Terminationof
 Service, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the“
Severance Date”),  regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily,or
 whether  the  Participant  was  employed  or  provided  services  for  a  portion  of  the  vesting  period  prior  to  a  Vesting  Date.  Notwithstanding  theforegoing,
 in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to the Participant’s Disability at a time when Stock Units remain unvestedunder
 the Award, (a) the Award shall vest with respect to the number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the number of then-outstandingand
 unvested Stock Units as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant toSection 3 on the next Vesting Date followi
ng the Severance Date but for such2

Termination of Service, by (ii) a fraction,  the numerator of which shall be the number of days that have elapsed between the Vesting Date thatimmediately
 preceded the Severance Date (or, in the case of a Termination of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date, the Vesting CommencementDate)
 and the Severance Date, and the denominator of which shall be the number of days between the Vesting Date that immediately preceded theSeveranc
e Date (or, in the case of a Termination of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date, the Vesting Commencement Date) and the next VestingDate
 following the Severance Date that would have occurred but for such Termination of Service; and (b) any Stock Units (as well as the relatedDividend
 Equivalent Rights) that are not vested after giving effect to the foregoing clause (a) shall terminate on the Severance Date. Further, in theevent
 the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to the Participant’s death, any unvested Stock Units shall be fully vested as of the SeveranceDate,
 and any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited  to the Participant  shall be paid. If  any unvested  Stock  Units are terminated  hereunder,  suchStock
 Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Datewithout
 payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant or the Participant’s personal representative,as the case may be.
9.
    Recoupment.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued,delivered
 or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any suchShares or
 property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company may require theParticipant
 to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered orpaid
 in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares orproperty, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following h
as occurred:(a)
during the period of the  Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment Period
”),  the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offenseunder the applicable laws of any rel
evant foreign jurisdiction);(b)
during  the  Employment  Period  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  the  Participant  has  committed  or  engaged  in  a  breach  ofconfidentiality,
 or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information ofthe Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c)
during  the  Employment  Period  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  the  Participant  has  committed  or  engaged  in  an  act  of  theft,embezzlement
 or  fraud,  or  materially  breached  any  agreement  to  which  the  Participant  is  a  party  with  the  Company  or  any  of  itsSubsidiaries.
For
 purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’sbehalf,
 to any brokerage firm or third party administrator holding the Participant’s Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-convey,transfer, or
 otherwise return such Shares and other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect tosuch matters.
10.
    Adjustments  Upon Specified Events.  Upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events  relating  to  the  Company’s  stock  contemplated  bySection
 11  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  an  extraordinary  cash  dividend  on  such  stock),  the  Committee  shall  make  adjustments  inaccordance
 with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect ofthe Award. No such adjustment
 shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuantto Section 5(b).

11.    Responsibility for Taxes.  The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company or the Participant’s employer(“
Employer”)  take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax,payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participatio
n in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant or deemedby
 the Company or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Participant even if technically due by the Company or the Employer (“Tax- Related
 Items”),  the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any,actually
 withheld  by  the  Company  or  the  Employer.  The  Participant  further  acknowledges  that  the  Company  and  the  Employer  (i)  make  norepresentat
ions or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant ofthe Stock
 Units, the vesting of the Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting, and the receipt of anydividends or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit
 to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of theAward
 to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  Participant’s  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  or  achieve  any  particular  tax  result.  Further,  if  the  Participant  is  orbecomes
 subject  to  tax  in more  than  one jurisdiction,  the  Participant  acknowledges  that  the  Company  or  the  Employer  (or  former  employer,  asapplicable) may be required to withho
ld or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.Prior
 to  the  relevant  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,  the  Participant  shall  pay  or  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  theCompany
 or  the  Employer  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related  Items.  In  this  regard,  the  Participant  authorizes  the  Company  or  the  Employer,  or  theirrespective
 agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable withholdingobligations with regard to all Tax-Rel
ated Items by one or a combination of the following:(a)    
withholding from any wages or other cash compensati on payable to the Participant by the Company or the Employer;(b)
    withholding  otherwise deliverable Shares and from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid uponvesting/settlement of the Award;
(c)
     arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’sdirection pursuant to this authorization), includi
ng selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan; or(d)    
withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acqu ired upon vesting/settlement of the Award.Notwithstanding
 the  foregoing,  if  the  Participant  is  an  officer  of  the  Company  who  is  subject  to  Section  16  of  the  Exchange  Act,  thenthe
 Company  must  satisfy  any  withholding  obligations  arising  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,by
 withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method(b),
 unless  the  Board  or  the  Committee  determines  in  its  discretion  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  one  or  a  combination  ofmethods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
 
   The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates, includingmaximum
 rates  applicable  in  the  Participant’s  jurisdiction(s).   If  the  maximum  rate  is  used,  any  over-withheld  amount  may  be  refunded  to  theParticipant
 in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refundfrom
 the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to theapplicable
 tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares asdescribed
 herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Stock Units,notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are
4

held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or theproceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participa
nt’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.12.
    Electronic  Delivery and Acceptance.  The  Company  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  deliver  any  documents  related  to  the  Award  byelectronic
 means or request the Participant’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive allapplicable

ion otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms (including Exhibit A  hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “
Award Agreement ” applicable to the Award. 2.
    Stock Units.  As used herein, the term “Stock Unit ”  shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeepingpurposes
 to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company’s Common Stock (“Share ”)  solely for purposes of the Plan and this AwardAgreement.
 The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if suchStock Units vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.
3.
    Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shal l vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and Exhibit A
 hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date ”). 4.
    Continuance of Employment.  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continuedactive
 employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this AwardAgreement.
 Employment  or  service  for  only  a  portion  of  the  vesting  period,  even  if  a  substantial  portion,  will  not  entitle  the  Participant  to  anyproportionate
 vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave ofabsence
 (other  than a personal leave of absence)  and (b)  the first  thirty  (30)  days of an approved personal leave of absence,  in each case asapproved

 by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time toterminate
 such  employment  or  services,  or  affects  the  right  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  to  increase  or  decrease  the  Participant’s  othercompensation

5.    Dividend and Voting Rights. (a)
    Limitations on Rights Associated with Stock Units.  The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company,no
 dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to theStock
 Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by theParticipant.
 No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of thestock certificate or book entry evidencing such Shares.
(b)
    Dividend  Equivalent Rights Distributions.  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares,the
 Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on suchdate,
 multiplied by (ii) the total target number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to theAward
 that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend  Equivalent Right”).  Any Dividend Equivalent Rightscredited
 pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions andrestrictions
 as the original Stock Units to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that theamount
 of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rightsthat are paid will
 correspond to the percentage of the total target number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A . No
 crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any Stock Units which, immediately prior tothe record date for that dividend, have either been paid p
ursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A . 6.
    Restrictions on Transfer.  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interesttherein
 or  amount  or  Shares  payable  in  respect  thereof  shall  not  be  sold,  assigned,  transferred,  pledged  or  otherwise  disposed  of,  alienated  orencumbered, either voluntarily or involuntari
ly.7.
    Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units.  On or as soon as administratively practical following the vesting event pursuant toSection
 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to theParticipant
 a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, asdetermined
 by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related
 Items (as defined in Section 11 below), unless such Stock Units terminate prior to the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’sobligation
 to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participantor
 other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested Stock Units deliver to the Company any representations orother documents
 or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any StockUnits that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.
8.
    Effect of Termination of Service.  Except as provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s Stock Units (as well as therelated
 Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such Stock Units have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination ofService,
 meaning  the  first  date  the  Participant  is  no  longer  employed  by  or  providing  services  to  the  Company  or  one  of  its  Subsidiaries  (the“
Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, volu ntarily or involuntarily orwhether
 the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date. In the event the Participant’sSeverance
 Date is the result of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s death or Disability and the Severance Date occursprior to the Vesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with resp
ect to a number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the Stock2

Units  as  well  as  the  related  Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  subject  to  the  Award  that  would  have  otherwise  vested  pursuant  to  the  Award  on  suchVesting
 Date  but  for  the  Termination  of  Service  and  to  the  extent  the  applicable  performance-based  vesting  requirement  is  satisfied,  by  (ii)  theSeverance
 Fraction (determined as set forth below). Any Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are unvested on theSeverance
 Date  and  that  are  not  eligible  to  vest  on  the  Vesting  Date  following  the  Severance  Date  pursuant  to  the  preceding  sentence  shallterminate
 as of the Severance Date, and any Stock Units that remain outstanding and unvested after giving effect to the preceding sentence shallterminate
 as  of  the  Vesting  Date.  The  “Severance  Fraction”  means  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  determined  by  subtracting  thenumber
 of days remaining in the Performance Period on the Severance Date from the total number of days in the Performance Period, and thedenominator
 of which shall be the total number of days in the Performance  Period. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated pursuant to thisAward
 Agreement, such Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of theapplicable Severance
 Date (or, to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the Vesting Date, as provided inExhibit A
)  without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary orpersonal representative, as the case may be.

 property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company may require theParticipant
 to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered orpaid

evant foreign jurisdiction);(b)
during  the  Employment  Period  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  the  Participant  has  committed  or  engaged  in  a  breach  ofconfidentiality,

 or  fraud,  or  materially  breached  any  agreement  to  which  the  Participant  is  a  party  with  the  Company  or  any  of  itsSubsidiaries.
For
 purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’sbehalf, to
 any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Company to hold the Participant’s Shares and other amounts acquiredunder
 the Plan to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company’sexclusive remedy with respect to such matters.

 11  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  an  extraordinary  cash  dividend  on  such  stock),  the  Committee  shall  make  adjustments  inaccordance
 with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect ofthe Award. No such adjustment
 shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuantto Section 5(b).

 tax,  payment  on  account  or  other  tax-related  items  related  to  the  Participant’s  participation  in  the  Plan  and  legally  applicable  to  theParticipant or deemed by the Company
 or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Participant even if technically due by the Company or theEmployer
 (“Tax-Related  Items”),  the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may exceed theamount,
 if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer(i)
 make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, includingthe
 grant of the Stock Units, the vesting of the Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting and thereceipt
 of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grantor
 any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if theParticipant
 is  or  becomes  subject  to  tax  in  more  than  one  jurisdiction,  the  Participant  acknowledges  that  the  Company  and/or  the  Employer  (orformer employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or acco
unt for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.Prior
 to  the  relevant  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,  the  Participant  shall  pay  or  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  theCompany
 and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or theirrespective
 agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable withholdingobligations with regard to all Tax-Rel
ated Items by one or a combination of the following:(a)

withhol ding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid uponvesting/settlement of the Award;
(c)
     arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’sdirection pursuant to this authorization), includi
ng selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan; or(d)    
withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acqu ired upon vesting/settlement of the Award.Notwithstanding
 the  foregoing,  if  the  Participant  is  an  officer  of  the  Company  who  is  subject  to  Section  16  of  the  Exchange  Act,  thenthe
 Company  must  satisfy  any  withholding  obligations  arising  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,by

 unless  the  Board  or  the  Committee  determines  in  its  discretion  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  one  or  a  combination  ofmethods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
 
   The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates, includingmaximum
 rates  applicable  in  the  Participant's  jurisdiction(s).   If  the  maximum  rate  is  used,  any  over-withheld  amount  may  be  refunded  to  theParticipant
 in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refundfrom
 the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to theapplicable
 tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares asdescribed
 herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Stock Units,notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are
4

held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or theproceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participa
nt’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.12.

PERFORMANCE AWARDEXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS
The
 Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined basedon the Company’s relative total sharehold
er return (“TSR ”) Percentile for the Performance Period.The percentage of the Stock Units (and related Divide
nd Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Unitswill vest on the Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest onthe Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest onthe Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the Stock Units will vest onthe Vesting Date.
For TSR
 Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the Stock Units that will veston
 the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e. , linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicatedabove.
Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance  Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundredpercent (100%) of the target Stock Units vest.
The
 number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the Stock Units willnot vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.
    For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will a
pply:•
“TSR Percentile”  means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the Comparison Group members forthe
 Performance  Period.  In  determining  the  Company’s  TSR  Percentile  for  the  Performance  Period,  in  the  event  that  theCompany’
s TSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison Group members for that sameperiod,
 the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking the Company’s TSR for that period as being greaterthan such other Comparison Group members.
•
“Comparison Group” means the  Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index on the first day ofthe
 Performance  Period  and, except  as provided  below,  the common  stock  (or  similar  equity security)  of which continues  to  belisted or
 traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a member ofthe
 Comparison  Group  files  for  bankruptcy  or  liquidates  due  to  an  insolvency,  such  company  shall  continue  to  be  treated  as  aCompariso
n Group member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar equity security)of such company is no longer listed or
A-1

traded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event of a formation of a newparent company by a Comparison Group member, substantially all of the assets an
d liabilities of which consist immediately after thetransaction
 of the equity interests in the original Comparison Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparison Groupmember
 immediately prior to the transaction, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparison Group member tothe extent (and for such peri
od of time) as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securitiesexchange
 but the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original Comparison Group member are not. In the event of amerger
 or  other  business  combination  of  two  Comparison  Group  members  (including,  without  limitation,  the  acquisition  of  oneComparison

 successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparison Group, provided that thecommon stock
 (or similar equity security) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last tradingday
 of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable stock prices shall be equitably andproportionately

 obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends and otherdistributi
ons during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be valued at fairmarket

 prices  of  such  company’s  common  stock  on  the  principal  exchange  on  which  such  stock  is  traded  for  the  twenty  (20)consecutive

 and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closingmarket price on the date of distribution.
 
   With respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an equitable and proportionate adjustment to theextent (if any) necessary
 to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or reverse stocksplit
