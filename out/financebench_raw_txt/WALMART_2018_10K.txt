The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorpor
ated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened afranchise Ben Franklin vari
ety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, ourfounders' business was devoted entir
ely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened inRogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, 
and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.In 1991, we began our first intern
ational initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as ofJanuary 31, 2018 
, our Walmart Intern ational segment conducted business in 27 countries.In 2000, we began our first eCommer
ce initiative by creating walmart.com. That same year, we also created samsclub.com. Since then, our digital presence hascontinued to grow. In 2007, walmart.co
m launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. In2016, we acquired jet.com in th
e U.S. and formed a strategic alliance with JD.com in China. Subsequent to the jet.com purchase, we have acquired several otherU.S. eCommerce entities. In 2017, wal
mart.com launched free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items and we created Store N o  8, a tech incubator with afocus to drive commerc
e forward. These eCommerce efforts have led to omni-channel offerings in many markets, including over 1,100 "Online Grocery" pickuplocations in the U.S.
Information About Our Segments
The Company is engaged in the opera
tion of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina,Brazil, Canada, Central Amer
ica, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportablesegments: Walmart U.S., Wa
lmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decisionmaker ("CODM") regularly revi
ews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of itssegments. It is imprac
tical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.Walmart U.S. is our largest s
egment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, aswell as eCommerce. Wal
mart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fisca l 2018 , and of our three segments, W almart U.S. is the largest and hashistorically had the high
est gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amountto the Company's net sales and oper
ating income.Walmart International consists 
of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and is divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. Thesecategories consist of m
any formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well aseCommerce. Walmart International ge
nerated7

approximately 24% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of itsmerchandise mix. Wal
mart International is our second largest segment.Sam's Club consists of membership-on
ly warehouse clubs and operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as eCommerce. Sam's Club accountedfor approximately 
12% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. As a membership-on ly warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment'soperating income. Sam's Club oper
ates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.The Company measures the resul
ts of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporateoverhead allocations. From 
time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, asdetermined by the infor
mation regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances arereclassified to be co
mparable to the current period's presentation.Walmart U.S. Segment

l industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:•

ment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that give our customers confidence that we will have the products theyneed and operating hours that

Walmart Interna tional operates eCommerce websites in numerous countries. Customers have access through our eCommerce websites and, in countrieswhere available, mobil
e commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country. Our omni-channel offeringsinclude capabiliti
es like "Click & Collect" in the United Kingdom and our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets.Merchandise. 
The merchandising strat egy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope ofmerchandise offered 
for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developedmarket specific pr
ivate brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,""George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "M
ainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brandsincluding "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You" and "Ex
tra Special." In addition, we have developed relationships with11

regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.Operations. 
The hours of operation for oper ating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon localand national ordinances gove
rning hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.Seasonal Aspects of Operations. 
Walmart Interna tional's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operatingincome have occurred in 
the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays,festivals and customs, as wel
l as different weather patterns.Competition. 
Walmart International competes with both physical r etailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,hypermarkets and supercen
ter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores,and digital retail
ers, as well as catalog businesses. We also operate, on a li mited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites fornew or relocated units. Our abi
lity to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integratesdigital and physical s
hopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe priceleadership is a crit
ical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operatefood departments effe
ctively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have eCommercewebsites or mobile comme
rce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers forcustomers and their purch
ases, both in our digital and physical retail operations.Distribution. 
We utilize a total of 188 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa andthe United Kingdom. Through these fac
ilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart Internationalsegment. During fiscal 
2018 , approximately 83% of Walmart Intern ational's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance ofWalmart Interna
tional's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. The following table provides further details of our internationaldistribution facili

As a retailer and warehouse

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS The risks described below could m
aterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations couldalso be affected by addi
tional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.Strategic Risks
General or macro-economi
c factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.General economic conditio
ns and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.Higher interest rates, 
lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and otherenergy, weakness in the housing mark
et, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment,decreases in consumer dispos
able income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns,fluctuations in curren
cy exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes,the imposition of measure
s that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown and other economic factorsin the U.S. or in any of the other ma
rkets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets,change the mix of products we se
ll to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net salesand result in slower inventory 
turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.In addition, the economic 
factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs orcommodity prices, and othe
r economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general andadministrative expenses an
d otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.The economic factors th
at affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of thegoods we sell to our customers or, in 
more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.We face strong competition fro
m other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both),which could materially adversely affe
ct our financial performance.Each of our segments compet
es for customers, employees, store and club sites, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of itsbusiness with many other local, 
regional, national and global physical and digital retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.Our Walmart U.S. segment 
competes with both physical r etailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialtystores, supermarkets, hyper
markets and supercenter-type stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with oth erwholesale club operators, as we
ll as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well asdigital retaile
rs and catalog businesses.17

Our Walmart International segment competes with both physical r etailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,hypermarkets and supercen
ter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores,and digital retail
ers, as well as catalog businesses.We compete in a vari
ety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,location, store hours, in-sto
re amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digitalplatforms, cost and speed of 
and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through the omni-channel integration of 
our physical and digital retail operations. A failure to respond
 effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materiallyadversely affect our financial 
performance. See " Item 1. Business " above for additional discuss ion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.Certain segments of the r
etail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retailmarketplace. Such consolid
ation, or other business combinations or alliances, may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved accessto merchandise, great
er market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations oralliances could resul
t in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which couldadversely affect our financial 
performance.We may not timely identify or e
ffectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to pr
edict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success ofour business depends in part on how accur
ately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing productsand the competitive env
ironment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital platforms or through the combination ofboth. Price transparency, asso
rtment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers andcontinue to increase in im
portance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers forpurchasing products. Our failur
e to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on ourpart to timely ident
ify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with ourcustomers, the demand for 
the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.Failure to grow our eCommerce business through the 
omni-channel integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing eCommerce investments, may ma
terially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.The retail business is rap
idly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, theportion of total consumer 
expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase couldaccelerate.
Our strategy, which includes inves
tments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us togrow our eCommerce business, incr
ease comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of ourbusiness of a moderated pac
e of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver aseamless omni-channel shopp
ing experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . As a result, our market posit ion, net sales andfinancial performance could be
 adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic inour stores and clubs, which would, in turn, r
educe the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce oursales within our stores and clubs 
and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations.Furthermore, the cost of c
ertain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired eCommerce businesses willadversely impact our financial
 performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.The performance of strategic al
liances to support the expansion of our Walmart International segment could materially adversely affect our financialperformance.
Our Walmart Interna
tional segment may enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digitalretail operations, physi
cal retail operations or both. Any strategic alliance may not generate the level of eCommerce or other sales we anticipate when entering intothat alliance or may otherwi
se adversely impact our18

business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connectionwith a strategic alliance coul
d materially adversely affect our financial performance.Operational Risks
Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-polit
ical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.The occurrence of one or mo
re natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditionssuch as major or extended wint
er storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-politicalevents, such as war, civil unres
t or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations andfinancial performance.
Such events could result in physic
al damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distributionfacilities, the l
ack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected bysuch events, the evacuation o
f the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms toour customers, changes in the pu
rchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply ofproducts from some local 
and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to ourdistribution facili
ties or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility servicesto our stores and our facil
ities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.We bear the risk of losses 
incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory andbusiness interruption caused by su
ch events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which theyoccur and could materially a
dversely affect our financial performance.Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could mate
rially adversely affect our financial performance.The products we sell are sourc
ed from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factorin our financial perfo
rmance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to otherwise meetour required supplier stand
ards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficientmanner, is a significan
t challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.Political and economic 
instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'failure to meet c
ertain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and theirmanufacturers, the availability 
of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from thesuppliers and manufactur
ers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount ofmerchandise we purchase en
ters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to thesuppliers and the countries 
in which they are located are beyond our control.In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trad
e policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on theimportation of cert
ain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.These and other factors a
ffecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.If the products we sell are not safe or otherwis
e fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries sufferedby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise exper
ience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance.Our customers count on us to provide th
em with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers orthat we prepare and then se
ll could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food andnon-food needs, even if the basis 
for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly toreestablish. As such, any issue reg
arding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation andfinancial performance.

We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harmour ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual 
transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.Our information systems ar
e subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, othermalicious computer programs
, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations),catastrophic events such 
as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential toour business operations, including 
the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and ouronline operations. Our inform
ation systems are not fully redundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make asignificant investmen
t to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our informationsystems may have a mate
rial adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processesand systems. The risk of system dis
ruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our informationsystems and processes, we may fa
il to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.If the technology-based systems that give our custom
ers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as ourability to grow our eCommerce business globally, could be ma
terially adversely affected.Many of our customers shop with us using our dig
ital platforms, which are a part of our omni-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers,tablets, and smart phones to shop on
line and through digital platforms with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media andelectronic mail 
to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition tohome delivery, we offer "W
almart Pickup," "Pickup Today" and "Club Pickup" and, in a growing number of locations, "Online Grocery" programs under whichmany products available 
for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic atsuch stores and clubs. Omni-channe
l retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth oreCommerce acquisitions) an
d in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.We must anticipate 
and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operationsthrough focusing on the building and de
livery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provideattractive, user-
friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options andthat continually mee
t the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology couldplace us at a competi
tive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on thegrowth of our eCommerce business glob
ally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Our digital platforms, which 
are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems onwhich they run, including those appl
ications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, may be subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks could involveattempts to gain acc
ess to one of our eCommerce websites or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members'payment information and 
related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage oneor more of our digital pl
atforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security ofour digital platforms and
 keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage anddeterioration of our co
mpetitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of whichevents could have a mate
rial adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.Any failure to maintain the security of the 
information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result ofcybersecurity attacks on our information syst
ems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause usto incur substantial additional costs, and materially advers
ely affect our business and operating results.As do most retailers, we rec
eive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive andstore personal informa
tion concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We alsoutilize third-par
ty service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery tocustomers and members, ba
ck-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members,associates or vendors. In addi
tion, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, includinginformation permit
ting cashless payments.20

Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasinglysophisticated. Cyber threa
ts and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single "hackers" or smallgroups of "hackers." Each year, cyb
er-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve,change and become more di
fficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's securitymeasures in the future 
and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.Associate error or mal
feasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' securitymeasures and a breach of ou
r or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufactureor operations or could be inadv
ertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party serviceproviders may not discover any s
ecurity breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.Any breach of our security me
asures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, orany failure by us to comply with 
applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect anycustomers, members, assoc
iates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our informationsystems and administrat
ive processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.In addition, such events could be wid
ely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors andshareholders, could harm our 
competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales inour eCommerce operations, 
as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cashflows and liquidity. Such events could 
also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition andperformance and could r
esult in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by ourinsurance policies. Moreov
er, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breachand to expend significant add
itional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and otherattempts to access such 
information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations.We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer newpayment options over time, whi
ch may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject tovarious industry data prote
ction standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data SecurityStandard. We cannot be cer
tain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detectany cyber-attacks, cybe
r terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our o
r one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may bematerially adversely affected by claim
s from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances,payment card associat
ion rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers ifinformation in connect
ion with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, thecost of complying with stric
ter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us.Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely af
fect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Walmart has reta
il pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and a large majority of the retail pharmacy net sales are generated by fillingprescriptions for which we re
ceive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as privateinsurers, governmental ag
encies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").Our retail pharmacy ope
rations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,shifts in the relativ
e distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorablereimbursement ter
ms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwisereceive preferential coverage treatment); gr
owth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operatedby PBMs and/or any insurance plan or progr
am; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in theadministrative burdens 
associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become availableto consumers; introduction o
f lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changesin drug mix (i.e., the rel
ative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes21

in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition fromother retail pharm
acy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of ourpharmacy customers to pay 
for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentivethresholds to which our level of 
third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and thepharmaceutical indus
try, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or theenactment and imple
mentation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.If the supply of certain ph
armaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severelyaffected until at 
least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in asignificant number of o
ur pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.One or a combination of such fa
ctors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with ourretail pharmacy ope
rations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn,adversely affect our ov
erall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Our failure to attract and reta
in qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adverselyaffect our financial performanc
e.Our ability to continue to condu
ct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associatesglobally. Our ability to me
et our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs anddistribution centers, whil
e controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of asufficient number of qua
lified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,changing demographics, heal
th and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, toattract or to retain qualified per
sonnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.In addition, if our costs of l
abor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted orimplemented that further increase 
our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.Financial Risks
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may mat
erially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.Our operations in countries oth
er than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements aredenominated in U.S. dollars, and to pr
epare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expensesof our operations outside of th
e U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currencyexchange rates that wer
e unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.As a result of such translat
ions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidatedfinancial statements reflecting sig
nificant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in ourfinancial perform
ance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange ratefluctuations will adversel
y affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reportedconsolidated results of ope
rations.We may pay for products we purch
ase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which thegoods will be sold. When we must acquir
e the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorableto us, our cost of sales may inc
rease and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, witha corresponding adverse ef
fect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.Failure to meet market expe
ctations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.We believe that the price of 
our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting theseexpectations, including our 
comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth22

rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchaseprograms or policies. 
Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to match that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our operations subject us to legislative, 
judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries orregions in which we operate, which could materially adverse
ly affect our business or financial performance.In addition to our U.S. operations, we oper
ate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India,Japan and the United Kingdom and our ma
jority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico.In fiscal 2018, our Walma
rt U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sal es. The Federal Government hascreated the potenti
al for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countrieswhere we source many of the produc
ts we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination oftrade agreements and 
the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubsis manufactured in othe
r countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increasesin the prices at which we sel
l such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and ourbusiness.
During fiscal 2018
, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sal es. Walmart International's operations in variouscountries also sources goods and se
rvices from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors,most of which are beyond our contro
l. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal andregulatory constraints, 
local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies,currency regulations, and o
ther matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.Our business and results of operat
ions in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in tradepolicies, or changes in labo
r, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union.Brazilian federal, s
tate and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, theCompany's subsidiaries in Brazil 
are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course ofbusiness in Brazil.
 These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financialperformance.
The economies of some of the 
countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if theyoccurred again, could a
dversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary andfiscal policies of th
e U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risksassociated with having numerous 
facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our internationaloperations generally in
clude, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty inenforcing intellec
tual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doingbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exagg
erated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws andregulations.
In foreign countries in which we h
ave operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in businesspractices prohibited by U.S. laws and 
regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of othercountries, such as the UK Bribery Act. W
e maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption complianceprogram designed to ensure co
mpliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractorsor agents, including those based 
in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries maybe customary, will engage in bus
iness practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws andregulations. Any such violations, ev
en if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.We are subject to inco
me taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. Thedetermination of our worldwid
e provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxescould be materially adversely
 affected by earnings being23

lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changesin the valuation of our def
erred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e "Tax Act") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018,the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statuto
ry tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-partypayments. In addition, the Company was sub
ject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject toU.S. income tax. The Securities and Ex
change Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") on December 22, 2017, whichallows companies to record p
rovisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of theenactment and the comp
lexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisionalamounts in our financial s
tatements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. As the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets theTax Act and any additional guidan
ce issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments tothe provisional amounts during 
fiscal 2019. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in whichthe adjustments are m
ade and could impact our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity.We are subject to regu
lar review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changingtax regulations and legi
slation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recordedin our consolidated financ
ial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which suchdetermination and set
tlement is made.We operate in complex 
regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes toexisting legal requirements i
ncluding the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicableregulations. Our pharmacy ope
rations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirementsfor pharmacies and reimburseme
nt arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration andregulation of pharmac
ies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulationsincluding Medicare and Med
icaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the AffordableCare Act or any successor ther
eto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governingexposure to, and the managem
ent and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (the "FDA") and the Drug Enfo
rcement Administration (the "DEA"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, andconsumer protection and sa
fety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing theavailability, sale, 
advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and statelaws governing health care 
fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.For example, in the United Stat
es the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlledsubstances. We are requi
red to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various statecontrolled substance ac
ts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA andstate regulatory authorities 
have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrativesanctions for violations of 
these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulatingmatters of working conditions, h
ealth and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters, as well as employee benefit,competition, anti-mon
ey laundering, antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the United States. Changesin laws, regulations and polic
ies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantlyaffect our cost of doing busin
ess.The impact of new laws, regula
tions and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicablelaws, regulations an
d policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult toimplement, increase our operati
ng costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulationscould result in the imposi
tion of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension ofpayments from government p
rograms; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs,including the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. Any failure tocomply with applicable r
egulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial24

exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain lega
l proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are involved in a numbe
r of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in anumber of cases containing 
class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number ofcases containing class-
action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Comp
any, has been named as a defendant in over 10,000 "equal value" claimspending in the Manchester Emp
loyment Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA storeemployees, allege tha
t the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobsto that of male employ
ees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is notobjectively justifi
ed. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rateson a prospective basis. At presen
t, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that mayarise from these proc
eedings.In December 2017, the United Stat
es Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by variousplaintiffs, including coun
ties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning theimpacts of widespread opioid 
abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for th
e Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrictlitigation, including c
ases filed by several counties in West Virginia; by healthcare providers in Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Florida; and by the St. CroixChippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Simil
ar cases that name the Company have been filed in state courts by various counties and municipalities; by health careproviders; and by various Native Am
erican Tribes.  At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate anyloss or range of loss that may 
arise from such claims.We discuss these cases and oth
er litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item 3. Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10 in the " Notes to our Consolidated Financial State
ments ," which are part of this Annual Repor t on Form 10-K.We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanc
tions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.The Audit Committee of our Board of Di
rectors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and otheralleged crimes or m
isconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether priorallegations of such viola
tions and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of ourpolicies, practices 
and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since theimplementation of th
e global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware ofadditional allegat
ions regarding potential violations of the FCPA.Inquiries or investigat
ions regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate,including, but not limited 
to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the"DOJ") and the SEC. We have been cooperating wi
th those agencies and discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters. Thesediscussions have progressed to a poin
t that we can now reasonably estimate a probable loss and have recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect tothese matters (the "Accrual").
A number of federal an
d local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the mattersunder investigation have be
en filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex'scurrent and former officers.
We could be exposed to a vari
ety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of thematters that are 
the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,penalties, injunctions, c
ease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgmentsagainst us and our current and 
former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interestregarding these matters, incl
uding additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certainaudiences. Moreover, we have in
curred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimonyand other information in
25

connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations.While we have made an Accru
al for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the finalresolution of these mat
ters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherentuncertainties in such si
tuations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future.ITEM 1B.

II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: 
The Company is a defendant in seve ral lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in anews story that appeared in 
The New York Times ( the " Times " ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the UnitedStates District Court for th
e Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges variousviolations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Prac
tices Act (the "FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, as amended, relat
ing to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquiredstock of the Company between Decemb
er 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conductaffected the value o
f such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed apetition to appeal the 
class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit denied the Company's pet
ition.In addition, a number of der
ivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former directors a
nd certain former officers as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominaldefendant) allege, a
mong other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection withtheir oversight of FCPA compliance. Al
l of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidated29

in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the Western Districtof Arkansas granted the defend
ants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed their notice of appealwith the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Eighth Circuit. On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissalof the consolidated deriv
ative proceedings in Arkansas. There was no appeal from that ruling. On May 13, 2016, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted thedefendants' motion to dismiss 
the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On June 10, 2016, plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidated derivativeproceedings filed thei
r notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. On January 25, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of theconsolidated derivativ
e proceedings in Delaware.Management does not believ
e any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to theCompany's financial condition o

III. ENVIRONMENTAL 
MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires dis closure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosedin accordance with that 
requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may beincurred in connection with 
each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.On January 25, 2018, the Environmental Prose
cutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of $163,000for the absence of an Environ
mental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company plans to challenge the fine before anadministrative court.
In May 2017, WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltd
a ("Walmart Brazil") self-reported to the relevant municipal environmental agency, and proposed a remediationplan for, an oil contamin
ation in the soil and underground water at the Walmart and Sam's Club store location in Barueri, São Paulo (Tamboré), whichcontamination had been con
firmed by an internal investigation in April 2017.  Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency, including seeking authorization tostart a remediation plan.
In April 2017, the California Air Resou
rces Board ("ARB") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed depositscollected on sales of sm
all containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperlyretained approximat
ely $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing.In November and December 2016, the Env
ironmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico ("Ministry") notified a subsidiary of the Company,Arrendadora de Centros Comerci
ales, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("Arrendadora"), that it was proposing aggregated penalties approximating $430,000 in respect to fourstores which the Ministry bel
ieved may have been constructed without first obtaining a required environmental impact license. Arrendadora has challenged thepenalties before an ad
ministrative court and the trials are in process. The Ministry had previously proposed penalties of approximately $640,000 related to thismatter in 2014, but Arrendador
a was released by an administrative court from payment of such penalties on the basis that the Ministry had failed to comply withlegal formalities in connection
 with their imposition.On April 6, 2015, representatives fo
r the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that Walmart Brazil had failed to file required reports documenting thenumber of tires import
ed, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000, which may be doubled and excludes additional amounts inrespect of inflation and i
nterest, and prohibited Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed itsdefense with the agency aga
inst the imposition of this penalty.In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corpo
racion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality ofCurridabat is seeking a pena
lty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distributioncenter that is situated alon
g a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at thetime of construction, but 
the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.In January 2011, the Environmenta
l Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soilcontamination due to le
akage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as theDistrict Attorney's Office 
for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.ITEM 4.

ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSI ON AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview
Walmart Inc. ("Wa
lmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through our operations, wehelp people around the world save 
money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we are striving tocreate a customer-centric experience that
 seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping into an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers.Physical retail encomp
asses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail, or eCommerce, is comprised of oureCommerce websites, mobil
e commerce applications and transactions involving both an eCommerce platform and a physical format, which we refer to as omni-channel. Each week, we serve nea
rly 270 million customers who visit our more th an 11,700 stores and numerous eCommerc e websites under 65 banners in 28 countries. Our strategy is to 
lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. By leading on price weearn the trust of our custo
mers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is ourpricing philosophy under which we pric
e items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.Price leadership is cor
e to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to ourcustomers. Our physical and digi
tal presence, in which we are investing to integrate into a seamless omni-channel, provides customers convenient access to ourbroad assortment anytim
e and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great shopping experience through whichever shopping method theyprefer.
Our operations consist of thre
e reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.•
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats and eCommerce, as well as an omni-channel offering. Of our three reportablesegments, Walmart U.S. has histo
rically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, it has historicallycontributed the great
est amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.•
Walmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These categories, includingeCommerce, consist of many 
formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry.Overall gross profit rate
 for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International isour second largest segment 
and has grown in recent years by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding eCommerce.•
Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as eCommerce through samsclub.com. As a membership-only warehouse club,membership income is a s
ignificant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operatingexpenses as a percentage o
f net sales than our other segments.Each of our segments contribu
tes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to theCompany's net sales and operating 
income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due tofluctuations in curren
cy exchange rates.Our fiscal year ends on 
January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendaryear basis. Our business is seasonal 
to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highestsales volume and operating 
income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . This discussion, which presents our resu
lts for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018 "), January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 ") and January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 
2016 ") should be read in conjunction wi th our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide thereader with information that
 will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period toperiod and the primary f
actors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company'sperformance. Additional
ly, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding ofhow each of those segments and its 
results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.Throughout this Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable storeand club sales and other me
asures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certaincorporate overhead allocation
s, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certaincorporate overhead al
locations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, theprevious period amounts and bal
ances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.34

Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in salesfor such stores and clubs, includ
ing eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition ofcomparable sales inc
ludes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well aseCommerce sales. We m
easure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channeltransactions which are fu
lfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion ofthat store is accompan
ied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related toeCommerce acquisitions 
are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by otherswithin the retail indust
ry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is notnecessarily comparable to similarl
y titled measures reported by other companies.In discussing our operating resu
lts, we use the term "currency exchange rates" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for allcountries where the funct
ional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We calculate the effect of changes in currencyexchange rates from th
e prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchangerates, and current per
iod activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results ofthis calculation as th
e impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operatingincome, of the Company and the W
almart International segment in the future.The Retail Industry
We operate in the highly 
competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar,variety and specialty s
tores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or internationalchains or have a natio
nal or international online presence. We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in attracting andretaining quality emp
loyees ("associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophicevents, weather, competi
tive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods,currency exchange rat
e fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates,labor costs, tax rates, cyb
ersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to ourCompany and an investment in its s
ecurities can be found herein under " Item 1A. Risk Factors ," and under " Cautionary Statement Regard ing Forward-LookingStatements 
." Company Performance Metrics
We are committed 
to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust ourbusiness strategies to ma
intain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  Our financial framework is defined as:•
strong, efficient growth;•
operating discipline; and•
strategic capital allocation.As we execute on this financia
l framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.Strong, Efficient Growth
Our objective of priorit
izing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on increasing comparable sales and eCommerce sales growth while slowing the rate ofgrowth of new stores and clubs. At times, we 
make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company, which may not benefitcomparable sales in th
e near term.Comparable sales is a me
tric which indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, includingeCommerce sales, for a p
articular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retailcalendar (also known as the 4-5
-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterlyearnings releases. However, when we dis
cuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.As our fiscal calendar 
differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in ourquarterly earnings releases.
35

Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , were as follows:  
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,  
 2018  2017  2018  2017  
 With Fuel  Fuel Impact Walmart U.S.
 2.1%  1.6%  0.1%  0.0% Sam's Club
 2.8%  0.5%  1.0%  (0.9)% Total U.S.
 2.2%  1.4%  0.2%  (0.1)% Comparable sales in the U.S., includ
ing fuel, increased 2.2% and 1.4% in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. The fiscal2018 
total U.S. comparable sales we re positively impacted by continued traffic improvement, higher eCommerce sales and the impact of higher fuel sales.eCommerce sales positiv
ely impacted comparable sales approximately 0.7% for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club for fiscal 2018 . The fiscal 2017  total U.S. comparable sales were po
sitively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher eCommerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by thenegative impact of lowe
r fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. eCommerce sales positively impacted comparable salesapproximately 0.4% and 0.7% fo
r Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2017 . In the past, when we were focused on adding n
ew stores and clubs in the U.S., we did so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales awayfrom existing units. We r
educed the number of new store and club openings in fiscal 2018 and the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of these openingswas not significant. We expe
ct this trend to continue in the future as well. In fiscal 2017 , we estimate the negat ive impact on comparable sales as a result ofopening new stores and clubs was approxim
ately 0.7%. Our estimate was calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs,which are identified bas
ed on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the newstores and clubs are opened.
Operating Discipline
We operate with discipl
ine by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage,which we define as net sales growing 
at a faster rate than operating expenses. 
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)
 2018  2017 Net sales
 $495,761  $481,317 Percentage change from comparable period
 3.0 % 0.6 %Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses
 $106,510  $101,853 Percentage change from comparable period
 4.6 % 5.0 %Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales
 21.5 % 21.2 %For fiscal 
2018 , operating, selling, gener al and administrative ("operating") expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to thesame period in the previous 
fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as apercentage of net sal
es, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion of charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estateprojects, approximate
ly $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, a legal accrual of $283million related to 
the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to Walmart U.S. discontinued real estate projects, and the decisions to exit certain internationalproperties and wind down the first p
arty Brazil eCommerce operations.Strategic Capital Allocation
We are allocating 
more capital to remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. Thisallocation aligns with our 
initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping. The following tableprovides additional detail:
(Amounts in millions)
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures
 2018  2017 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations
 $914  $2,171 Remodels
 2,009  1,589 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other
 4,521  4,162 Total U.S.
 7,444  7,922 Walmart International
 2,607  2,697 Total capital expenditures
 $10,051  $10,619 36

Total U.S. capital expenditures decreased $478 million for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. Capital expenditures related to new stores andclubs, including expansions and re
locations, decreased $1.3 billion , partially offset by in creases to capital expenditures for remodels and for eCommerce,technology, supply chain and other. Th
ese changes were a result of our shift in capital allocation strategy to support growth in comparable store and club sales andeCommerce, while slowing the r
ate at which we open new stores and clubs.Returns
As we execute our financial 
framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. We measure returns on capital with our return on investment andfree cash flow metri
cs. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most d
irectly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles in 
the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAPfinancial measure, 
management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deployingits assets. Trends in ROI can fluc
tuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.2% and 
7.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decl ine in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and thedecrease in operating income
 for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 . ROI was 14.2% and 15.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decl
ine in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 . We define ROI as adj
usted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing12 months divided by average inves
ted capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,plus average accumulated de
preciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus arent factor equal to 
the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impactof the discontinued operat
ions.Our calculation of ROI is conside
red a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that areincluded and excluded in the 
most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, we exclude the impactof depreciation and amo
rtization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor ofeight for rent expense th
at estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measurecomputed in accordance wi
th GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which isconsolidated net income 
for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items andadds interest income; adju
sts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates afactor of rent to ar
rive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying ourkey assets and is more mean
ingful to investors than ROA.Although ROI is a standard financia
l metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculateour ROI may differ from the 
methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.37

The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Free cash flow is considered a non
-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, howeve r, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additionalcash from our business operat
ions, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should beconsidered in addition to, r
ather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as ameasure of our liquidity. Se
e Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including n et cash provided by operating activities, net cash used ininvesting activities 
and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash 
flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cashprovided by operating activ
ities of $28.3 billion , $31.7 billion and $27.6 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We gene rated free cash flow of$18.3 billion 
, $21.1 billion and $16.1 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decr eases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cashflow in fiscal 
2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other pay ments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in workingcapital management 
and the benefit from th e application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities and freecash flow in fiscal 
2017 from fiscal 2016 was primarily due to improved working capital m anagement. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new taxregulations related to the accelerate
d deduction of remodels and related expenses.Walmart's definit
ion of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that themeasure does not deduct the p
ayments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, webelieve it is import
ant to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . 38

Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used byWalmart's management to calculate o
ur free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets for
th a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe tobe the GAAP financial measure mos
t directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash usedin financing activities:

for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. Net sales increased $14.4 billion or 3.0% and $2 .7 billion or 0.6% for fiscal 
2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparablesales, the impact fro
m new store openings and sales generated from eCommerce acquisitions . Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sa les was partiallyoffset by a reduction in ne
t sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia busin esses and the $0.5 billion of negative impact f rom fluctuations incurrency exchange rat
es. For fiscal 2017 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales and the 1.3% year-over-year growth inconsolidated retail squ
are feet. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by a n egative impact of $11.0billion or 2.3% as a result o
f fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $0.4 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment.Our gross profit rate decr
eased 26 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 36 basis points fo r fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal2018 
, the decrease was primaril y due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from eCommerce. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross prof it rate wasprimarily due to improv
ed margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lowerfuel costs in the Walm
art U.S. segment. Additionally, improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics programs in the WalmartInternational segment also 
positively impacted our gross profit rate for fiscal 2017 . Operating expenses as a perc
entage of net sales increased 32 and 88 basis points for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year.For fiscal 
2018 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Clubclosures and discontinued re
al estate projects, approximately $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Officeseverance, a legal a
ccrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter in the third quarter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects inWalmart U.S., and the decisions 
to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in operating expenses as a per
centage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from thecontinued investment in asso
ciate wage structure, a $370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects and severance, and our39

continued investments in eCommerce and technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closur
es in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Membership and other incom
e was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased $1.0 billion fo r fiscal 2017 , when compared to the same pe riod in the previousfiscal year. While fiscal 
2018 included a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia, a $47 million gain from a land sale, higher recycling income from oursustainability effor
ts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club, these gains were less than ga ins recognized in fiscal2017 
. Fiscal 2017 included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile.For fiscal 2018, loss on extinguishmen
t of debt was  $3.1 billion , due to the early extinguish ment of long-term debt which allowed us to retire highe r rate debt toreduce interest expens
e in future periods . Our effective income 
tax rate was 30.4% for fiscal 2018 and 30.3% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 . Although relatively consist ent year-over-year, our effectiveincome tax rate may 
fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances,changes in tax laws, outcomes of 
administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. operations and internationaloperations. The reconciliati
on from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 is presented in Note 9 in the " Notes to Consolidated Financial State
ments " and describes the impac t of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") to the fiscal 2018 effectiveincome tax rate.
As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, we reported $10.5 billion and $14.3 billion of consolidated net incom e for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, which represents a decrease of 
$3.8 billion and $0.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income percommon share attribut
able to Walmart ("EPS") was $3.28 and $4.38 for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment

increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 2.1% and 1.6% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and year-over-year growt
h in retail square feet of 0.7% and 1.4% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Additional ly, for fiscal 2018 , sales generated fromeCommerce acquisitions 
further contributed to the  year-over-year increase.Gross profit rate decre
ased 24 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 24 basis points fo r fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primaril
y due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from eCommerce. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings 
from procuring merchandise. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross prof it rate was primarily due to improved margin in food andconsumables, including the i
mpact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased 101 basis points fo r fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fisc
al 2018 and fiscal 2017 included charges rela ted to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million and $249 million, respectively. Forfiscal 
2017 , the increase was prima rily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the investment in the associate wage structure; the charge related todiscontinued real esta
te projects; and investments in digital retail and technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal2017 
was partially offset by th e impact of store closures in fiscal 2016.As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income increased $124 million for fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.3 billion fo r fiscal 2017 , respectively.

ar. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sa les was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of newstores, partially offs
et by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia busin esses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency e
xchange rates. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease in net sa les was due to a $11.0 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currencyexchange rates. Additional
ly, net sales for fiscal 2017 were impacted by positive comparable sales in all of our markets, except in the United Kingdom, and year-over-year growth in reta
il square feet of 1.2%.Gross profit rate decre
ased 28 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 46 basis points fo r fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in the gross p

2017 included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile . Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales decreased 11 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 58 basis points fo r fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal yea
r. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an inc rease in net salespartially offset by restructuri
ng and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from decisions to exit certain propertiesand to wind down the first party Braz
il eCommerce operations. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to decl
ining sales on relatively flat fixed costs in the United Kingdom, as well as adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairment chargesin certain markets.
Segment operating income was n
egatively impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $68 million and $642 million for fisca l 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As a result o
f the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $406 million for fiscal 2018 and increased $412 million for fiscal2017 
, respectively. Sam's Club Segment
We believe the infor

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.9 billion or 3.2% and $0.5 billion or 0.9% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to theprevious fiscal year. For f
iscal 2018 , the increase in net sa les was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion 
in fuel sales from higher  fuel prices in fiscal 2018 . For fiscal 2017 , the increase in net sa les was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales withoutfuel driven by higher
 eCommerce sales, and a year-over-year increase in retail square feet of 0.9%, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in fuel salesprimarily from lower 
fuel prices in fiscal 2017 . In the future, net sales wi ll be negatively impacted by our decision to remove tobacco in certain clubs.Gross profit rate decre
ased 44 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 39 basis points fo r fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross prof
it rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to the club closures, a reclassification of certainsupply expenses from operating 
expenses to cost of goods sold, higher inventory shrink, increased shipping costs at samsclub.com and the investment in cashrewards. For fiscal 
2017 , the increase in gross prof it rate was primarily due to margin rate improvement in home and apparel, health and wellness, and grocery,partially offset by ch
anges in merchandise mix and the growth of the Cash Rewards program.Membership and other incom
e increased 2.3% for fiscal 2018 and decreased 6.5% for fis cal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in membersh
ip and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membershipincome resulting from 
increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease was prima rily due to a reduction in other income partially offset by anincrease of 2.3% in memb
ership income as a result of increased Plus Member renewals.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales increased 80 and 49 basis points for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to the previousfiscal year. For fiscal 
2018 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billionrelated to club closur
es and discontinued real estate projects. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarilydue to an increase in wage, ben
efit and incentive expenses from the investment in the associate wage structure, as well as our investments in eCommerce andtechnology and an increase 
in advertising expense.As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income decreased $689 million and $149 million f or fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability o
f our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,supplemented with our long-te
rm debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that supportthe long-term growth of our ope
rations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock andshare repurchases. We be
lieve our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, paydividends and fund our share repur
chases for the foreseeable future.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

 $28,337  $31,673  $27,552 Net cash provided by operating a
ctivities was $28.3 billion , $31.7 billion and $27.6 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decr ease in net cashprovided by operating activ
ities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other pay ments, as well as lapping theprevious year's improvemen
ts in working capital management and the benefit from th e application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. The increase in netcash provided by operating ac
tivities for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, was primarily due to improved working capital m anagement.Additionally, we benefited f
rom the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses.Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were 
$6.8 billion and $6.9 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our working capi tal deficit was $18.9 billion and $9.2billion 
at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The increa se in our working capital deficit reflects an increase in short-term borrowings as part of our long-termdebt extinguishment act
ivity as well as improved procurement and inventory management. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficientuse of cash in funding operations, 
consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends andshare repurchases.

We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum costpossible. We do not believe i
t will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cashflows provided by domestic opera
ting activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certainexceptions, to continue to ind
efinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. As part of U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22,2017, we are currently assessing 
the impact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact our assertion regarding any potential future repatriation. If ourintentions with respect to 
reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although anyrepatriation under new U.S. tax l
aws could be subject to incremental withholding taxes. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potentialtaxes on anticipated fu
ture repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results ofoperations.
As of 
January 31, 2018 and 2017 , cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to locallaws or other restrict
ions.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

$4.9 billion for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. Fiscal 2018 included cash received o f $1.0 billion from thesale of Suburbia in Mexico, while 
fiscal 2017 included our acquisition of J et.com, Inc. ("jet.com") for approximately $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion ofavailable for sale s
ecurities in JD.com ("JD"). Net cash used in investing activities increased $3.3 billion for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous f iscalyear, primarily due to ou
r acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD, partially offset by $0.7 billion in cash received from the sales of shopping malls in Chile.Refer to 
Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD. Additionally, refer to the "Strategic Capital Alloc
ation " section in our Company Performance Metri cs for capital expenditu re detail for fiscal 2018 and 2017.We continued to focus on eComme
rce, including a seamless omni-channel shopping experience, in each of our segments during fiscal 2018 . Our fiscal 2018 accomplishments in this 
area include growing "Online Grocery" to over 1,100 pickup locations in the U.S., new dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, two-dayfree shipping with no membersh
ip fee at Walmart U.S. and one-hour delivery from stores in China.Growth Activities
For the fiscal year ending J
anuary 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019 "), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion and involve:•
in Walmart U.S., continuing to prioritize store remodels and digital experiences, with approximately 1,000 additional online grocery locations;•
in Walmart International, investing more in fulfillment capabilities in addition to new stores; and,•
eCommerce investments that include enhanced supply chain capabilities.Globally, in fiscal 
2019 , we expect to add approximat ely 280 new, expanded or relocated stores and clubs, with approximately 255 of those in WalmartInternational, focusing on k
ey markets such as Mexico and China.Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

 2018  2017  2016 Net cash used in financing activities
 $(19,875 )  $(19,072 )  $(16,285 ) Net cash flows used in financing a
ctivities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid andthe repurchase of Company stock. T
ransactions with noncontrolling interests are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financingactivities increased 
$0.8 billion and $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compar ed to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Net cashused in financing activi
ties for fiscal 2018 increased due to premiu ms paid for early extinguishment of debt. Net cash used in financing43

activities for fiscal 2017 increased primari ly due to repurchases of Company stock partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt. Further discussion offinancing activiti
es is provided by major category below.Short-term Borrowings
Net cash flows provided by short-te
rm borrowings increased $4.1 billion in fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 , when compared to the balanc e atthe end of the previous fisc
al year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments,share repurchases, capi
tal expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2018 , the additional cash provid ed by short-term borrowings was primarily due tothe timing of our January 2018 deb
t extinguishment. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease in net c ash flows provided by short-term borrowings was due to improved cashflows from operations driven by work
ing capital improvements and changes to tax regulations.The following table includes 
additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 :

  January 2, 2019Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, we repu
rchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchasesmade during the fiscal y
ear prior to November 20, 2017 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2018 . On October 9, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new 
$20.0 billion share repurchase progra m which, beginning on November 20, 2017, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As ofJanuary 31, 2018 
, authorization for $18.8 billion of share repurchases re mained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares areconstructively reti
red and returned to an unissued status.We regularly review sha
re repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,current cash needs, capa
city for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significantmajority of the ongoing shar
e repurchase program will be44

funded through the Company's free cash flows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid pershare and total amount pa
id for share repurchases for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 :

ing InterestsIn fiscal 2016, as described 
in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest inYihaodian, our eCommerce oper
ations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete the transaction. The Company subsequently soldYihaodian to JD in fiscal 2017.
Capital Resources
We believe cash flows fro
m operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cashneeds, which include funding seasona
l buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share repurchases.We have strong commerc
ial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due atfavorable rates in c
apital markets. At January 31, 2018 , the ratings assigned to our co mmercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were asfollows:
Rating agency
  Commercial paper   Long-term debt Standard & Poor's
  A-1+   AA Moody's Investors Service
  P-1   Aa2 Fitch Ratings
  F1+   AA Credit rating agencies 
review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.Accordingly, we are not able to p
redict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings includechanges in our operating per
formance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt andcapitalization, and 
changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs orimpair our ability to access
 capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratingscould impair our ability t
o access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to relymore heavily on more expens
ive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper ordebt securities. Each r
ating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of anyother rating. Moreover, e
ach credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.45

(3)
Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases wi th initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2018 . Additionally, the Company has 
$12.5 billion in undrawn committed lines o f credit in the U.S. and approximately $4.0 billion of undrawn committed lines of creditoutside of the U.S. which, if drawn upon, would be includ
ed in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Estimated interest p
ayments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2018 , and assumes interest ra tesremain at current levels for o
ur variable rate debt.Purchase obligations include 
legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capitalexpenditures, software acqu
isition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for thepurchase of goods or services a
re defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimumquantities to be purchased
; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company willpurchase all or a portion o
f its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from thetable above. Additionally, pur
chase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather thanbinding agreements. Our purchas
e orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter intocontracts for outsourced s
ervices; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing forcancellation without sign
ificant penalty.The expected timing for p
ayment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be differentdepending on the timing of re
ceipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.In addition to the amounts shown in th
e table above, $1.0 billion of unrecognized tax benef its are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded asliabilities. The timing of t
he payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements for additionaldiscussion of unrecognized tax b
enefits.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of 
January 31, 2018 , we had no off- balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on ourconsolidated financia
l condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.46

Management strives to r
eport our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex andrequire us to use technic
al terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in theU.S. These principles require us to 
make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in ourfinancial statem
ents. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.Management continually 
reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is asummary of our critic
al accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.Inventories
We value 
inventories at the lower o f cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO")method for Walmart U.S. segm
ent's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method ofaccounting, using the first
-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market,since permanent markdowns a
re immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using theweighted-average cost LIFO me
thod.Under the retail method o
f accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandisegrouping's retail value. The FIFO cost
-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFOprovision is based on the initi
al margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting requiresmanagement to make c
ertain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profitrecognized. Judgments made 
include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory hasdiminished, markdowns for cle
arance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current andanticipated demand, cus
tomer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could alsocause changes in the amount 
and timing of markdowns from year to year.When necessary, we record a L
IFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.Our LIFO provision is calculated bas
ed on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase toour retail price ind
ices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. At January 31, 2018 and 2017 , our inventories valued at L IFOapproximated those invento
ries as if they were valued at FIFO.We provide for estima
ted inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annualinventory counts, the provision is 
adjusted to reflect updated historical results. Historically, our estimated inventory losses have been materially accurate whencompared to annual invento
ry counts and we expect that trend to continue.Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-liv
ed assets, other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate their carrying amount
s may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditionsand financial perfor
mance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual storelevel. The variabili
ty of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in47

demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairmentexist and require impa
irment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-liv
ed assets. Although impairment charges for fiscal 2018 were $1.4 billion , these charges primarily related to restructuring  activitiesdescribed in 
Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . Impairment charges not related to restructuring act
ivities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were not material and would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscountedcash flows for the stores with ind
icators of impairment. Additionally, total impairme nt charges for fiscal 2017 were not material. Goodwill and other indefinite
-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the 
value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether aquantitative impairment test is 
necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit ismore likely than not less 
than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then aquantitative impairment test w
ould be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows,growth rates and economic and 
market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation methodsuch as discounted cash flow or a r
elative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets havegenerated sufficien
t returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in thesetests, if different conditio
ns occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquiredindefinite-lived intangible as
sets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes
Income taxes have a signi
ficant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, thedetermination of our prov
ision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Oureffective income tax rate is affected 
by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuationallowances, changes in tax l
aw, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operationswhere the statutory rat
es are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.Our tax returns are routin
ely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions arerecorded in our financi
al statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, fromtaxing authorities. When 
facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Weaccount for uncertain 
tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in thefinancial statem
ents. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductibleand taxable items.
Deferred tax assets rep
resent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporarydifferences between th
e financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assetsare evaluated for fu
ture realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors areconsidered when assessing whether i
t is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations offuture taxable income, carryfor
ward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated byassessing the adequac
y of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings andavailable tax planning strate
gies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e "Tax Act") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018,the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statuto
ry tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. Inaddition, the Company was subject to 
a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $0.2 billion related to the enac tment of the Tax Act. The benefit primarilyrelated to the rem
easurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the Tax Act's newly enacted tax rates and is net of the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on p
reviously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements, as the Companycollects and prepares n
ecessary data, and interprets the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may m
ake adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes andeffective tax ra
te in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act is provisional and will be completed by themeasurement period prov
ided in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.48

ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCL OSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk
In addition to the risks inhe
rent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchangerates.
The analysis presented below fo
r each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does notrepresent our view of futur
e market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,however, a change in one facto
r could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk bymanaging the mix of fixed 
and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2018 , the net fair value of ou r interest rate swaps decreasedapproximately  
$87 million primarily due to fluctuation s in market interest rates.The table below provides infor
mation about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents theprincipal cash flows and re
lated weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flowsand weighted-average int
erest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows tobe exchanged under the contr
acts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2018 .

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives c lassified as fair value hedges.As of 
January 31, 2018 , our variable rate bor rowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 26% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on 
January 31, 2018 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change byapproximately 
$96 million . Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctu
ations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S. For fiscal 2018 , movements in currency ex
change rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom andCanada were the primary c
ause of the  $2.3 billion gain in the currency tr anslation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge aportion of our foreign curr
ency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investmenthedges.
We hold currency swaps to hedge th
e currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposureassociated with the fore
casted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of$413 million 
at January 31, 2018 and a liability position o f $147 million at January 31, 2017 . The change in the fair va lue of these swaps was due to fluctuations incurrency exchange rat
es, primarily the strengthening of other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2018 . A hypothetical 10% increas e or decrease in thecurrency exchange rat
es underlying these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 2018 would have resulted in a loss or ga in in the value of the swaps of $560 million 
. A hypothetical 10% change in in terest rates underlying49

these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2018 would have resulted in a loss or ga in in the value of the swaps of $22 million . In addition to currency swaps, we hav
e designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of ourforeign operations. We had ou
tstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion at January 31, 2018 and £2.5 billion at January 31, 2017 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the Uni
ted Kingdom. At January 31, 2018 , a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Britishpound would have resulted in a change 
in the value of the debt of $217 million . In addition, we had outstanding long- term debt of ¥180 billion at January 31, 2018and 
¥10 billion at January 31, 2017 that was designated as a hedge o f our net investment in Japan. At January 31, 2018 , a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease invalue of the U.S. dollar rela
tive to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million . In certain countries, we
 also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated innon-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
During fiscal 
2018 , the fair value of our  available-for-sale investment in JD increased approximately $1.5 billion , due to an increase in the market value of JD.50

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of Walmart Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We
 have  audited  Walmart  Inc.'s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of January  31,  2018 ,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-IntegratedFramework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, WalmartInc. (the Company) mai
ntained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  accompanyingconsolidated balance sheets
 of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the related  consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders'equity
 and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January  31, 2018 ,  and the related notes and our report dated March  30, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The
 Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol
 over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion onthe
 Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to beindependent
 with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  andExchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in
 accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective inter
nal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe
 design  and operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based on  the assessed  risk, and  performing  such  other  procedures  as we  considered  necessary  in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA
 company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand
 dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in
 accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations
 of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition o
f the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Walmart Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Walmart Inc. (for
merly "Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.") ("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere– in retail stores and th
rough eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digitaland physical shopping into an omni-
channel offering that saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves nearly 270 million customers who visit its more than 
11,700 stores and numerous eCommerc e websites under 65 banners in 28 countries. The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate onaccess, be competitiv
e on assortment and deliver a great experience.The Company's operations comprise 
three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018 "), January 31, 2017 
("fiscal 2017 ") and January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 "). All material int ercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The Company consolidates variab
le interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.Investments in unconsolidat
ed affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using theequity method. These equity m
ethod investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company's Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. TheCompany consolidates all othe
r operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during themonth of January 
2018 related to the opera tions consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require managementto make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure ofcontingent assets and liab
ilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual resultsmay differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments wi
th a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronictransfer transact
ions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified ascash and cash equivalents to
taled $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In addit ion, cash and cash equivalents included restrictedcash of 
$300 million and $265 million at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, which was prim arily related to cash collateral holdings from variouscounterparties, as required
 by certain derivative and trust agreements.The Company's cash balances are h
eld in various locations around the world. Substantially all of the Company's $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents atJanuary 31, 2018 
, was held outside of the U.S. Of the Company's $6.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2017 , $5.9 billion was held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outs
ide of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.The Company uses intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimumcost possible. Management does no
t believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidityneeds will be met through cash 
flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, theCompany intends, with only certain 
exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U.S. in its foreign operations. Aspart of the U.S. tax reform en
acted on December 22, 2017, the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact itsassertion regarding any pot
ential future repatriation. If the Company's intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within theCompany's foreign operations could b
e repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under new U.S. tax laws could be subject to incremental withholding taxes.The Company does not expect curren
t local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S.to have a material 
effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.60

As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.due to local laws or other r
estrictions.Receivables
Receivables are stat
ed at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from:•
insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales;•
banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process;•
suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and•
real estate transactions.Inventories
The Company values 
inventories at the lower o f cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out("LIFO") method for Walmar
t U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method ofaccounting, using the first
-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market,since permanent markdowns a
re immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using theweighted-average cost LIFO me
thod. At January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as ifthey were valued at FIFO.
Assets Held for Sale
Assets held for sale repres
ent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset andliability amounts in th
e Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fairvalue, less cost to sell.  The Comp
any reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts arefully recoverable in 
comparison to estimated fair values.  As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale wereclassified within prepa
id expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are 
initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements arecapitalized, while cos
ts of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property andequipment balances and i
ncludes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:

 depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Totaldepreciation and amor
tization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal 2018 , 2017and 
2016 was $10.5 billion , $10.1 billion and $9.5 billion , respectively. Leases
The Company estimates the exp
ected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude theabandonment of the lease 
at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected termis used in the determina
tion of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, theuseful life of leasehold im
provements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures aremade for leasehold imp
rovements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the61

useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements andescalations are considered i
n the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense foroperating leases.
The Company is often involved in the 
construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor'sconstruction of the leas
ed assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardlessof the significance, a
re automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financingobligation. Upon completion of th
e lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligationcan be derecognized fro
m the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have "continuing involvement," the leased assets and therelated financing obl
igation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term,including exercise of any 
renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cashgain on sale of the property.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are ini
tially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the c
arrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual storeor club level. Undiscounted cash 
flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If theevaluation indicates that the
 carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the relatedasset or asset group as dete
rmined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reportingunit when acquired. Other acqui
red intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intendeduse of the related asse
t. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstance
s indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortizedon a straight-line basis ov
er the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.Goodwill is evaluated for imp
airment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitativeassessment is first performe
d to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessmentbased on the qualitative 
factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unitsubstantially in excess of 
the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwillimpairment is perfo
rmed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relativemarket-based approaches. 
After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, theCompany has not recorded any impa
irment charges related to goodwill.The following table refl

Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2017 Walmart U.S. acquisitions primarily relates to Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"). Indefinite-lived in
tangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated forimpairment based on the
ir fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were nosignificant impairment charges relate

Self Insurance ReservesThe Company self-insures a numbe
r of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, genera l liability, auto liability, product liability and certainemployee-related healthcare benefits 
. Standard actuarial pro cedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of thebalance sheet date on an und
iscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to th
e processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reservevaluations provided by independen
t third-party actuaries. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits andretentions, including stop-
loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted f
or under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequencesattributable to differences bet
ween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporarydifferences"). Deferred tax a
ssets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to berecovered or settled. The
 effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.Deferred tax assets ar
e evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.Many factors are conside
red when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,expectations of future taxa
ble income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets isevaluated by assessin
g the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operatingearnings and available 
tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.In determining the provis
ion for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and taxincome, and statutory inco
me tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.The Company records a liabil
ity for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Companyrecords interest and pen
alties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, inthe Company's Consolidated Statemen
ts of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.Revenue Recognition 
    Sales
The Company recognizes sales r
evenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. eCommerce sales includeshipping revenue and are re
corded upon delivery to the customer. Additionally, estimated sales returns are calculated using historical experience of actual returns asa percent of sales.
Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membe
rship fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Thefollowing table summarizes
 membership fee activity for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 :

is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred membership fee isincluded in accrued li
abilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Gift Cards
Customer purchases of gift c
ards, to be utilized in our stores or on our eCommerce websites, are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and thecustomer purchases mer
chandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and memberscan redeem their gi
ft cards for merchandise indefinitely. Gift cards in some foreign countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. A certainnumber of gift cards, both with 
and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed gift cards and recognizes63

revenue for these amounts when it is determined the likelihood of redemption is remote. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates.Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue 
from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component ofnet sales in the Company's Consolidat
ed Statements of Income.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actua
l product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost oftransportation from th
e Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and importdistribution centers. Cost of s
ales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consider
ation from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specificprograms such as markdowns, margin p
rotection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost ofsales, except in cert
ain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company'sConsolidated Statements of In
come when the related inventory is sold.Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, genera
l and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, themajority of the cost of wa
rehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,selling, general and adm
inistrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'distribution facili
ties in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may includeall costs related to their di
stribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed 
as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general andadministrative expens
es in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific,incremental and identifiable adverti
sing costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.Advertising costs were 
$3.1 billion , $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Pre-Opening Costs
The cost of start-up act
ivities, including organization costs, related to new store openings, store remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions are expensed asincurred and included in ope
rating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Pre-opening costs totaled$106 million 
, $131 million and $271 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Currency Translation
The assets and liabilit
ies of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheetdate. Related transla
tion adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income ofall international subs
idiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the incomestatements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2018
In March 2016, the Financial Accoun
ting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718) 
, which is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions. The ASU changed several aspects of the accounting for share-basedpayment award transact
ions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Management adopted thisASU beginning February 1, 2017, and as a result, re
classified an immaterial amount from operating activities to financing activities in the Company's prior yearconsolidated cash flows.
On December 22, 2017, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
("SAB 118"), in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 64

2017 ("Tax Act"). The Company has elected to record provisional amounts, as allowed by SAB 118, during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year ofthe enactment date. M
anagement expects to complete the analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.Pronouncements to Be Adopted in the Year Ending Januar
y 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019")In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU represents a single compreh ensive model torecognize revenue to dep
ict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to inexchange for those goods or servi
ces. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, under the modified retrospective approach, which resulted in animmaterial cumu
lative adjustment to retained earnings. Also, this ASU will require additional disclosures.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, 
Financial Instruments–Overall (Topic 825 ) , which updates certain aspe cts of recognition, measurement,presentation and disclosur
e of financial instruments. This ASU primarily impacts the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com ("JD"). The Companyadopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which resulted in 
a cumulative positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2.9 billion based on the market value of our investment in JD a
t January 31, 2018. The retained earnings adjustment relates to both the available for sale portion and the cost portion of theinvestment. Beginning February 1, 2018, th
e adoption requires the remeasurement of our investment in JD due to observable price changes and impairments, if any,to be recorded through the Consolid
ated Statement of Income, introducing volatility to reported net income.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, 
Statement of Cash Flows–Restricted Cash (Topic 230) , which requires restric ted cash to be included with cashand cash equivalents when recon
ciling the beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018,which, while immateria
l, will modify the Company's presentation of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At January 31, 2018, the Company had restricted cashrecorded in line ite
ms other than cash and cash equivalents of $258 million . In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2018-02,  
Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):Reclassification of Certain Tax E
ffects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Act inaccumulated other co
mprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained earnings. The ASU is effective February 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.Management anticipa
tes early adopting this optional standard and is evaluating the effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.Other Pronouncements Being Evaluated
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease asse ts and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. Certainqualitative and quanti
tative disclosures are also required, as well as retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The Company will adopt thisASU on February 1, 2019 and is implementing new le
ase systems in connection with the adoption. Management is progressing with implementation and continuingto evaluate the eff
ect to the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Management expects a material impact to the Company's ConsolidatedBalance Sheet.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measur ement of expected credit losses ofcertain financia
l instruments. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to theCompany's consolidated financi
al statements.65

Note 2. Net Income Per Common ShareBasic net income per com
mon share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted netincome per common share 
attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutiveeffect of share-bas
ed awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation ofdiluted net income per comm

The Company has awarded share-based 
compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for allplans was 
$626 million , $596 million and $448 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Share-bas ed compensation expense is generally included inoperating, selling, gener
al and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was 
$150 million , $212 million and $151 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The following table summarizes theCompany's share-based compensat

centive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan"), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, and as amended further as of February 1, 2017,and as renamed on February 1, 2018, was est
ablished to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensationawards for which 
210 million shares of Walmart co mmon stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, asamended. The Company believes th
at such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.The Plan's award types are summa
rized as follows:•
Restricted Stock and Performance Shar e Units. Restricted stock awards ar e for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictionsrelated to employmen
t. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to150% 
of the original award amoun t. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and p erformanceshare units may be settl
ed or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value ofrestricted stock awards 
is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units isdetermined on the date o
f grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and isrecognized over the vest
ing period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share unitsin fiscal 
2018 , 2017 and 2016 was 7.2% , 8.3% and 7.4% , respectively. 66

•Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provid e rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant date and the r
emaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grantusing the stock price discount
ed for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Theexpected dividend yield is b
ased on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used todetermine the fair value of restricte
d stock units granted in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was 9.0% , 9.0% and 8.7% , respectively. In addition to the Plan, the Company's subs
idiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-based comp
ensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above.The following table shows the act

From time to time, the Comp
any repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. Allrepurchases made during th
e fiscal year prior to November 20, 2017 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2018. On October 9, 2017, theBoard of Directors approved a new 
$20.0 billion share repurchase progra m which, beginning on November 20, 2017, replaced the previous share repurchaseprogram. As of 
January 31, 2018 , authorization for $18.8 billion of share repurchases re mained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchasedshares are constructiv
ely retired and returned to an unissued status.The Company considers several f
actors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,cost of borrowings, its results of op
erations and the market price of its common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number ofshares repurchased, avera

In May 2017, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its exist ing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercialpaper program.
The committed lines of credit
 in the table above mature at various times between May 2018 and May 2022 , carry interest ra tes generally ranging between LIBORplus 
10 basis points and LIBOR plus 75 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the committed linesof credit listed in th
e table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secureddebt. Additionally, the Company also 
maintains other committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. with an available and undrawn amount of approximately $4.0 billion 
as of January 31, 2018 . Apart from the committed line
s of credit, the Company has trade and stand-by letters of credit totaling $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. These letters 
of credit are utilized in normal business activities.The Company's long-term debt, which in

The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates. Interest costs are also impacted by certain derivative financial instruments described in 
Note 8 . (2)
Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. At January 31, 2018 and 2017 the Company had secured debt in the amount of $10 million and 
$14 million , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of approximately $101 million and $82 million , respectively. At 
January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in theamount of 
$500 million is structured to be rem arketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes doesnot occur at the time o
f any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par. Accordingly, this issuance hasbeen classified as long-
term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.69

Note 7. Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company records and discloses c
ertain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the assetcould be sold in an orderly tr
ansaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is theamount that would be paid to tr
ansfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liabilitywith the creditor. Assets and l
iabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.The levels of the fair v
alue hierarchy are:•
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company holds derivative inst
ruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values are the estimated amounts theCompany would receive or pay upon ter
mination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using theincome approach and Level 2 
inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the notional amounts and fair values of 
these derivatives were as follows: 
January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 (Amounts in millions)
Notional Amount  Fair Value  Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges

4,523  205  3,957  (618 )Total
$ 10,773  $322  $11,207  $(151 )Additionally, the Company's avail
able-for-sale securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. Changes in fair value are recorded inaccumulated other co
mprehensive loss. The cost basis and fair value of the Company's available-for-sale securities as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , are as follows:
 
 January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 (Amounts in millions)
 Cost Basis  Fair Value  Cost Basis  Fair Value Available-for-sale securities
 $1,901  $3,547  $1,901  $2,046 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and li
abilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair valuemeasurements. Generally, a
ssets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. Fiscal 2018 impairment charges to assetsmeasured at fair va
lue on a nonrecurring basis were $1.4 billion and primarily related to restructuring activities described in Note 14 , as well as discontinued realestate projects in th
e U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . These impairment charges  were classified in operating, selling, general andadministrative expens
es in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. The fair value was determined based on comparable market values of similarproperties or on a renta
l income approach, using Level 2 inputs. Impairment charges not related to restructuring or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 werenot material. 
Additionally, total impairme nt charges for fiscal 2017 were not material. Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equ
ivalents and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due totheir short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is a
lso recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing ratefor similar types of bor
rowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , are as follows:  
 January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 (Amounts in millions)

Note 8. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchangerates, as well as to main
tain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Companyto certain risks, such as m
arket and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change. In a hedgingrelationship, the change 
in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Creditrisk related to a derivative fi
nancial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or contractual,amount of the Company's derivat
ive financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due tocredit risk. Credit risk 
is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings andrequiring collater
al from the counterparty when appropriate.The Company only enters into deriv
ative transactions with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent toentering into derivat
ive transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. In connection with various derivative agreements,including master nett
ing arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $279 million and $242 million at January 31, 2018 and January 31,2017 
, respectively. The Company re cords cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. Furthermore, as part ofthe master netting a
rrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's netderivative liabil
ity position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Comp any did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2018 
and January 31, 2017 , respectively. The Company re cords cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterpartiesexclusive of any derivat
ive liability.The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, thecontractual terms o
f a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that areeffective at meeting the risk red
uction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedgeaccounting, depending on the natu
re of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedgedassets, liabilities o
r firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.Any hedge ineffectiveness is 
immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and theineffective portion h
as not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which theCompany has not elected hedge a
ccounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.Fair Value Instruments
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notionalamounts are used to measur
e interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps thatreceive fixed-interest rate payments
 and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of thederivative instrumen
ts match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fairvalues of these derivat
ive instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded inearnings, and, accordingly, do not 
impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging fromOctober 2020 
to April 2024 . Net Investment Instruments
The Company is a party to cross-cu
rrency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one curre
ncy for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated othercomprehensive loss, offset
ting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Theseinstruments will matur
e on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 . The Company has issued foreign-cur
rency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term d
ebt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debtinstruments is recorded i
n accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investment that is alsorecorded in accumula
ted other comprehensive loss. At January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , the Company had ¥180 billion and ¥10 billion , respectively, of outstanding long-term debt d
esignated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion and £2.5 billion at January 31,2018 
and January 31, 2017 , respectively, that was des ignated as a73

hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . Cash Flow Instruments
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecastedpayments of principal and 
interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments onthe non-U.S. denominated debt. The ef
fective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recordedin accumulated other 
comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Thehedged items are recognized
 foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of effectiveness(and measurement of any 
ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings eachperiod includes an amount th
at offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocableportion of the initial spo
t-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 
. Financial Statement Presentat
ionAlthough subject to master ne
tting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.Derivative instruments wi
th an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based onmaturity date, and those h
edging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7 for the net presentat
ion of the Company's derivative instruments.The Company's derivative instru
ments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as followsas of

$ 4,600  $6,204  $6,558 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enact
ed and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutorytax rate from 
35% to 21% and creates new taxes focus ed on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global in
tangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"). By operation of law, the Company will apply a blended U.S. statutory federal incometax rate of 
33.8% for fiscal 2018. In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings notpreviously subject to U.S. income t
ax.The Securities and Exchange Comm
ission (SEC) staff issued SAB 118 on December 22, 2017, which allows companies to record provisional amounts during ameasurement period not 
to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying theprovisions of the Tax Act, the Company m
ade reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31,2018, in accordance with SAB 118. As the Company colle
cts and prepares necessary data, and interprets the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by theU.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and othe
r standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts during fiscal 2019. Thoseadjustments may mate
rially impact the Company's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Theaccounting for the tax e
ffects of the Tax Act will be completed by the measurement period provided in SAB 118.Provisional amounts for the fo
llowing income tax effects of the Tax Act have been recorded as of January 31, 2018, and are subject to change during fiscal 2019.The net tax benefit re
cognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $0.2 billion . As the Company completes its ana lysis of the Tax Act and incorporatesadditional guidance tha
t may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, the Company may identify additional effects notreflected as of Janua
ry 31, 2018.One-time Transition Tax
The Tax Act requires the Company to p
ay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of15.5% 
to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. Th e Company recorded aprovisional amount of 
$1.9 billion of additional income t ax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company recorded a provisional amount based onestimates as it comp
letes its analysis of the application of the effects of the Tax Act as well as finalize its calculations surrounding the components of its foreignsubsidiaries subject to th
e transition tax including the potential of any correlative adjustments.Deferred Tax Effects
The Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory 
tax rate from 35% to 21% for years after 2017. Accord ingly, the Company re-measured its deferred taxes as of January 31,2018, to reflect the redu
ced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes75

are settled or realized. The Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the redu ced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act. Thebenefit associated with 
the remeasurement of the deferred taxes is provisional as of January 31, 2018, as the Company continues gathering the necessaryinformation to comple
te the calculations. The Company has no provisional adjustment with respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act as the Company is notable to make reasonable estimate
s of its related effects at this time. The Company has not yet elected an accounting policy to determine whether it will recognizeGILTI as a period cost when incurr
ed or to recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse.Effective Income Tax Rate R
econciliationThe Company's effective inco
me tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations,including the use of global fund
ing structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company'ssignificant accounting po
licies in Note 1 . The Company's non-U.S. income is generally sub ject to local country tax rates that are below the U.S. statutory tax rate.Certain non-U.S. earnings have been ind
efinitely reinvested outside the U.S. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate andthe effective inco
me tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows:

 $1,952  $2,768 Unremitted Earnings
The Company has previously asserted 
all of its unremitted earnings offshore were permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the Company did not record any deferredtaxes related to any outs
ide basis differences associated with its foreign subsidiaries. As part of the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, the Company iscurrently assessing the i
mpact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact its assertion regarding any potential future repatriation. After consideration of theprovisional transition t
ax calculation and deemed repatriation of the previously unremitted earnings, the Company is estimating, on a provisional basis, its outsidetax basis exceeds the outsid
e book basis of its foreign subsidiaries by approximately $10.0 billion . Once the calculations a re completed regarding the transition tax,taking into account the t
imeline provided in SAB 118, the Company will provide updated disclosures regarding any potential changes for its previous assertions.Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
At 
January 31, 2018 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $6.7 billion . Of these carryforwards, approximately 
$3.6 billion will expire, if not util ized, in various years through 2038 . The remaining carryfo rwards have no expiration. At January 31, 2018 , the Company's provi
sional transition tax calculation fully utilized all foreign tax credit carryforwards.The recoverability of 
these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, includingtaxable income in prior carry
back years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extentthe Company does not consider it mo
re likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that a valuationallowance has been establ
ished and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the valuationallowance will be released.
The Company had valuation allowanc
es of approximately $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, on defer red tax assetsassociated primari
ly with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not berealized. Net activ
ity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2018 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding thefuture realization of deferred tax
 assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2018 , decreases due to operating loss expirations 
and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assetswill be fully realized.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncerta
in tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probabilitythat the uncertain t
ax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.As of 
January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax b
enefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $690 million and $703 million as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
77

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: 
Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
2018  2017  2016 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year
$ 1,050  $607  $838 Increases related to prior year tax positions
130  388  164 Decreases related to prior year tax positions
(254 ) (32 ) (446 )Increases related to current year tax positions
122  145  119 Settlements during the period
(23 ) (46 ) (25 )Lapse in statutes of limitations
(15 ) (12 ) (43 )Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year
$ 1,010  $1,050  $607 The Company classifies inte
rest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,respectively. During fisc
al 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company recognized inte rest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $32 million , $35 million and $5million 
, respectively. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , accrued interest r elated to uncertain tax positions of $96 million and $72 million , respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidat
ed Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2018, accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $12 million were recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance She
ets. As of January 31, 2017, there were no accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions recorded in theCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the next twelve months, it 
is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between $50 million and $400 million, either because the t
ax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits asexpeditiously as possible. As a resu
lt of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelvemonths. The Company does not expect any ch
ange to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company remains subject to 
income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2013 through 2018 . The Company also remains subject to income tax exami
nations for international income taxes for fiscal 2011 through 2018 , and for U.S. state and local inco me taxes generally for the fiscalyears ended 
2013 through 2018 . Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax exa
minations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing invarious jurisdictions. In c
ertain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unlessotherwise indicated, the poss
ible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, ifdecided adversely to the Comp
any, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.In particular, Brazi
l federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a largenumber of non-income tax ass
essments. One of these interpretations common to the retail industry in Brazil relates to whether credits received from suppliersshould be treated as a redu
ction of cost for purposes of calculating certain indirect taxes. The Company believes credits received from suppliers are reductions incost and that it has substant
ial legal defenses in this matter and intends to defend this matter vigorously. As such, the Company has not accrued for this matter,although the Company may be requi
red to deposit funds in escrow or secure financial guarantees to continue the judicial process in defending this matter in Brazil.78

Note 10. ContingenciesLegal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of 
legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflectedin the Company's Consolidated Financia
l Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore anaccrual has not been mad
e. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter intodiscussions regarding settl
ement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and itsshareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the m
atters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liabilitymaterial to the Company's 
financial condition or results of operations.ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a def
endant in over 10,000 "equal value" claims that are  proceeding before anEmployment Tribunal in Manch
ester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, andfurther claims may b
e asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in termsof, among other things, the dem
ands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that thedisparity in pay between thes
e different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wagerates in the warehouse and dis
tribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to s
tay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had notadhered to the Tribunal's pro
cedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied ASDA'srequests. Following additional pro
ceedings, on June 20, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled in favor of ASDA on the "strike out" issue and remitted thematter to the Employm
ent Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. On July 12, 2017, claimants sought permission from theCourt of Appeals to appeal this ru
ling, which was granted on October 3, 2017. A hearing before the Court of Appeals is scheduled for October 23, 2018.As to the initial phase of th
e Equal Value claims, on October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants couldcompare their positions 
in ASDA's retail stores with those of employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities. On August 31, 2017, the EmploymentAppeal Tribunal affirm
ed the Employment Tribunal's ruling. The Employment Appeal Tribunal also granted permission for ASDA to appeal substantially all of itsfindings on August 31, 2017. ASDA sought permission to appeal the 
remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals onSeptember 21, 2017. A hearing before 
the Court of Appeals is scheduled for October 10, 2018.Claimants are now proceeding 
in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to thework performed by employees in ASDA's warehouse and d
istribution facilities.At present, the Company cannot pred
ict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise fromthese proceedings. The Company bel
ieves it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.National Prescription Opiate Litigat
ionIn December 2017, the United Stat
es Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants byvarious plaintiffs, inc
luding counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerningthe impacts of widespread op
ioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for th
e Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrictlitigation, including c
ases filed by several counties in West Virginia; by healthcare providers in Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Florida; and by the St. CroixChippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Simil
ar cases that name the Company have been filed in state courts by various counties and municipalities; by health careproviders; and by various Native Am
erican Tribes. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate anyloss or range of loss that may 
arise from such claims. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend theclaims vigorously.
FCPA Investigation and Related Mat
tersThe Audit Committee (the "Audit Com
mittee") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things,alleged violations of th
e U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, includingWal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walm
ex"), and79

whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engagedoutside counsel from a numbe
r of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters.The Company has also been conducting a vo
luntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company isengaged in strengthening its g
lobal anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures.  In November 2011, the Companyvoluntarily disclosed tha
t investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since theimplementation of th
e global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been madeaware of additional al
legations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit Committee and theCompany, together with their th
ird party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries orinvestigations regarding 
allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but notlimited to, Brazil, China 
and India.As previously disclosed, the Company is unde
r investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has beencooperating with the agenc
ies and discussions have been ongoing regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that theCompany can now reasonably estima
te a probable loss and has recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these ma tters (the "Accrual"). As thediscussions are continuing, the
re can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters.A number of federal and loc
al government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexicangovernmental agencies 
conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of theCompany's shareh
olders against it, certain of its current directors, and certain of its former directors, certain of its former officers and certain of Walmex's formerofficers.
The Company could be exposed to a vari
ety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions inrespect of the matt
ers that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments,settlements, fines, pen
alties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and the shareholder lawsuitsreferenced above may 
result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company expectsthat there will be on-going 
media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact theperception among cert
ain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.In addition, the Company has incur
red and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimonyand other information in 
connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations.These costs will be expensed as in
curred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company incurred the fol lowing third-party expenses inconnection with the FCPA investigation and 
related matters:

ts business in the future.80

tsThe Company offers a 401(k) plan fo
r associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. TheCompany also offers a 401(k) type p
lan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Underthese plans, after one ye
ar of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contr ibutions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matchingcontributions immedia
tely vest at 100% for each associate. Par ticipants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earn ings, but not more than the statutory limits.Associates in internation
al countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans areadministered based upon the 
legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.The following table summar

at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Overfunded a mounts are recorded as assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assetsand deferred charges. Under
funded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other. Certainother international operation
s also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant.81

Note 13. Acquisitions, Disposals and Related ItemsOther than the jet.com t
ransaction discussed below, the Company completed certain eCommerce acquisitions during fiscal 2018 and 2017 , which were immaterial, individually and in the aggr
egate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.The following significant t
ransaction primarily impacts the operations of the Company's Walmart U.S. segment:Jet.com, Inc.
In September 2016, the Company compl
eted the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based eCommerce company. The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S.segment is building upon the cur
rent eCommerce foundation, allowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer base. Thetotal purchase price 
for the acquisition was $2.4 billion , net of cash acquired. The a llocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets. As part o
f the transaction, the Company agreed to pay additional compensation of approximately $0.8 billion over a five year period. The following significant t
ransactions impact the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment:Suburbia
In April 2017, one of the Company's subsidiar
ies sold Suburbia, the apparel retail division in Mexico, for $1.0 billion . As part of the sales agree ment, the Companyis also leasing certa
in real estate to the purchaser. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.7 billion , of which $0.4 billion was recognized in the second qua rter offiscal 2018 in membership 
and other income, and the remainder was deferred and is being recognized over the lease terms of approximately 20 years . Yihaodian and JD.com, Inc. ("JD")
In June 2016, the Company sold certain 
assets relating to Yihaodian, its eCommerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application,to JD in exchange for 
Class A ordinary shares of JD representing approxima tely five percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. The $1.5 billion 
investment in JD is carri ed at cost and is included in other assets and deferred charges in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The sale resultedin the recognition of a 
$535 million noncash gain, which was included in me mbership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Comp
any purchased $1.9 billion of additional JD s hares classified as available for sale securities, representing an incrementalownership percentage of approx
imately five percent , for a total ownership of approx imately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares. In fiscal 2016, the Company compl
eted the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian for approximately $760 million , using existing cash to complete this t
ransaction.Note 14. Restructuring Charges
In the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2018, the Company announced several organizational changes to position the business for more efficient growth going forward. As aresult, the Company recorded 
$1.2 billion in pre-tax restructu ring charges in fiscal 2018 as follows:

ring charges of $1.2 billion are classified in ope rating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statementof Income for fiscal 2018. At J
anuary 31, 2018, substantially all of the severances costs were recorded in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated BalanceSheet. Almost all of these sev
erance costs are expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.82

Note 15. SegmentsThe Company is engaged in the opera
tion of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina,Brazil, Canada, Central Amer
ica, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportablesegments: Walmart U.S., Wa
lmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decisionmaker ("CODM") regularly revi
ews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of itssegments. It is imprac
tical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.The Walmart U.S. segment inc
ludes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well aseCommerce. The Walma
rt International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including eCommerce. The Sam's Club segmentincludes the warehouse memb
ership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocatedto any of the Company's segments.
The Company measures the resul
ts of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporateoverhead allocations. From 
time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,as determined by the info
rmation regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances arereclassified to be co
mparable to the current period's presentation.Information for the Company's s
egments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in thefollowing table:

ITEM 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREE MENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENone.
ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosur
e controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls andprocedures, no matter how well d
esigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management isnecessarily required 
to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control ormanage those entities, ou
r controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to ourconsolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controlsand increase effic
iency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, moreefficient systems, upda
ting existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasingmonitoring controls. 
These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financialreporting. However, they allow us to con
tinue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remainseffective.
An evaluation of the effe
ctiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report wasperformed under the superv
ision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon thatevaluation, our Chief Execut
ive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonableassurance that inform
ation required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisionsregarding required disc
losure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within thetime periods specifi
ed by the SEC's rules and forms.Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has respon
sibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is aprocess designed to
 provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reportingpurposes in accordance with a
ccounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financialreporting may not prevent o
r detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as ofJanuary 31, 2018 
. In making its assessment, m anagement has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of theTreadway Commission in Interna
l Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control overfinancial reporting was 
effective as of January 31, 2018 . The Company's internal control ov er financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their r
eport which appears herein.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in the Comp
any's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely tomaterially affect, the Company
's internal control over financial reporting.85

ARTICLE I.
GENERAL
1.1 
Purpose. Walmart
 Inc.  (“Walmart”)  established  the  Officer  Deferred  Compensation  Plan.  The  purpose  of  the  Plan  has  been  to:  (a)attract
 and retain the valuable services of certain officers; (b) recognize, reward, and encourage contributions by such officers to thesuccess
 of Walmart and its Related Affiliates; (c) enable such officers to defer certain compensation and bonuses, and to be creditedwith
 earnings and Incentive Payments with respect to such amounts recognized hereunder for such purposes; and (d) allow certainequity incentive awards deferred under the Walmart Inc.
 Stock Incentive Plan of 2005 to be credited under this Plan at the election ofthe grantee and to thereafter be subject to the terms of this Plan.
In Article VIII
 of the Plan, Walmart reserved the right to amend, suspend or to terminate the Plan in any manner that it deemsadvisable
 by  action  of  the  Committee.  Walmart  now  desires  to  amend  the  Plan  in  certain  respects,  including  to  cease  deferralelections
 as provided herein. Accordingly, the Plan is amended as set forth in this amendment and restatement effective February 1,2012. The Plan was renamed effective on February 1, 2018.

red at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A, and guidance issuedthereunder.

Incentive Payments. The
 Incentive  Payments  described  below  will  be  credited  to  a  Participant’s  Account.  A  Participant’s  entitlement  to  anIncentive Payment will be governed by this Section 4.2.
(a)
The  Incentive  Payments  provided  in  this  Section  apply  to  a  Participant’s  recognized  Deferred  Compensation  andDeferred
 Bonuses  for  a  Plan  Year  (other  than  Deferred  Compensation  and  Deferred  Bonuses  allocated  to  theParticipant’s Scheduled
 In-Service Accounts) and credited Plan earnings thereon, whether credited to the Participant’sAccount or Grandfathered Account. For
 this purpose, Deferred Bonuses shall be treated as being “for a Plan Year” forthe
 Plan  Year  to  which  the  Deferred  Bonus  pertains.  Incentive  Payments  are  separately  awarded  based  upon  aParticipant’s recognized
14

Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for a given Plan Year and credited Plan earnings thereon.(b)
The  amount of an Incentive Payment is based on the Participant’s recognized Deferred Compensation and DeferredBonuses
 for  a  Plan  Year  (other  than  Deferred  Compensation  and  Deferred  Bonuses  allocated  to  the  Participant’sScheduled
 In-Service  Accounts),  plus  credited  Plan  earnings  on  such  sums  through  and  including  the  IncentivePayment
 award date. The amount by which a Participant’s Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for a PlanYear
 (other than Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses allocated to the Participant’s Scheduled In-ServiceAccounts)
 exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Participant’s base compensation will not be recognized in computingan
 Incentive Payment. Base compensation for this purpose means the Participant’s annual base rate of compensationfor
 the  last  full  payroll  period  in  such  Plan  Year.  Credited  Plan  earnings  on  such  nonrecognized  DeferredCompensation
 or Deferred  Bonuses are likewise  not taken into account  in determining  the amount of an IncentivePayment.
 Further, in no event shall Deferred Special Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses, Deferred Equity or anyEmployer Contribution Credits be taken into account in determining the amount of an Incentive Payment.
(c)
If  a Participant remains continuously employed with Walmart or any Employer for a period of ten (10) consecutivefull
 Plan  Years,  beginning  with  the  first  day  of  the  first  Plan  Year  in  which  the  Participant  had  a  DeferredCompensation or Deferred Bonus
 election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the last dayof
 the tenth (10 th ) Plan Year of such period, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’s Account as ofthe
 last day of such tenth (10 th ) Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%) of theParticipant’s
 recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for ten (10), but not less than five (5), PlanYears
 (i.e., the first six (6) Plan Years of such ten (10)-year period), plus credited Plan earnings thereon through theaward
 date. For each full Plan Year thereafter in which the Participant remains continuously employed with Walmartor
 any Employer, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’s Account as of the last day of such PlanYear.
 Such  Incentive  Payment  will  be  equal  to  twenty  percent  (20%)  of  the  Participant’s  recognized  DeferredCompensation and Deferred Bonuses for the first Plan Year of the five (5)-consecutive Plan Year period ending on the
award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the award date.
(d)
If  a  Participant  remains  continuously  employed  with  Walmart  or  any  Employer  for  a  period  of  fifteen  (15)consecutive
 full Plan Years, beginning with the first day of the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a DeferredCompensation or Deferred Bonus
 election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the last dayof the fifteenth (15 
th ) Plan Year of such period, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’s Account asof
 the last day of such fifteenth (15 th ) Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal to ten percent (10%) of theParticipant’s recognized Deferred Compensation and
15

Deferred  Bonuses  for  fifteen  (15),  but  not  less  than  ten  (10),  Plan  Years  (i.e.,  the  first  six  (6)  Plan  Years  of  suchfifteen
 (15)-year  period),  plus  credited  Plan  earnings  thereon  through  the  award  date.  For  each  full  Plan  Yearthereafter
 in  which  the  Participant  remains  continuously  employed  with  Walmart  or  any  Employer,  an  IncentivePayment
 will be credited to the Participant’s Account as of the last day of such Plan Year. Such Incentive Paymentwill
 be equal to ten percent (10%) of the Participant’s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses forthe
 first Plan Year of the ten (10)-consecutive Plan Year period ending on the award date, plus credited Plan earningsthereon
 through the award date. The Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(d) shall not take into accountIncentive Payments credited under Section 4.2(c) or credited Plan earnings thereon.
(e)
The  Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(e) only apply if a Participant has been a Participant under thePlan (or a Prior Agreement) for five
 (5) or more full Plan Years and if the Participant dies, becomes Disabled, or has aSeparation
 from  Service  on  or  after  he  or  she  has  been  continuously  employed  with  Walmart  or  an  Employer  fortwenty

 periods described in Sections 4.2(c) and (d) above, after taking into account the application of Section 4.2(f). Inthat
 event, only the Incentive Payment next to be credited (i.e., twenty percent (20%) or ten percent (10%)) will becredited
 to the Participant’s Account as provided in this Section 4.2(e). In the event the Participant had not yet beenawarded
 or  credited  with  a  twenty  percent  (20%)  Incentive  Payment  under  Section  4.2(c),  the  Incentive  Paymentprovided
 by this Section 4.2(e) will be based upon the ratio of: (1) the number of full Plan Years worked since andincluding
 the first Plan Year in which the Participant  had a Deferred Compensation  or Deferred Bonus election ineffect
 under  this  Plan  or  a  Prior  Agreement,  to  (2)  ten  (10),  multiplied  by  twenty  percent  (20%).  Such  IncentivePayment
 will be based upon recognized amounts for the Plan Years which would otherwise have been considered incalculating the Participant’s first Incentive
 Payment under Section 4.2(c). If the Participant has been awarded a twentypercent
 (20%) Incentive Payment provided in Section 4.2(c), the Incentive Payment provided by this Section 4.2(e)will
 be based upon the ratio of: (1) the number of full Plan Years worked since the award date of the initial twentypercent
 (20%) Incentive Payment, to (2) five (5), multiplied by ten percent (10%). Such Incentive Payment will bebased
 upon recognized amounts for the Plan Years which would otherwise have been considered in calculating theParticipant’s
 first Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(d). The Incentive Payment provided under this Section 4.2(e)will
 be  determined  and  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Account  as  of  the  date  the  Participant’s  Plan  benefits  aredistributed
 in a lump sum payment. In addition, the Participant’s Account will also be credited as of such date withinterest
 pursuant to Section 4.1 determined as though the Incentive Payment provided under this Section 4.2(e) hadbeen
 credited  to  the  Participant’s  Account  on  the  last  day  of  the  Plan  Year  preceding  the  Participant’s  death,Disability
 or Separation from Service. If, however, a Participant’s benefits are to be distributed in installments, theamounts provided under this Section 4.2(e) will be
16

determined and credited to the Participant’s Account as of the distribution date of the initial installment.(f)
This  Section 4.2(f) shall not apply with respect to Plan Years beginning after March 31, 2009. With respect to PlanYears
 beginning  before  March  31,  2009,  the  Incentive  Payments  provided  in  this  Section  4.2(f)  apply  only  withrespect
 to those Participants who: (1) incur a Separation from Service on or after the last day of a Fiscal Year, butbefore
 the immediately following last day of a Plan Year (e.g., on or after January 31, but before the next March 31);and
 (2) who, but for such Separation from Service before the last day of a Plan Year, would have been credited withan
 Incentive  Payment  under  Section  4.2(c)  and/or  4.2(d).  In  that  event,  the  Incentive  Payments  which  would  havebeen
 credited  to  the  Participant’s  Account  but  for  such  early  Separation  from  Service  will  be  credited  to  theParticipant’s
 Account as if the Participant had remained employed with Walmart or any Employer through the lastday
 of the Plan Year, with no reduction due to the early Separation from Service. The Incentive Payments providedunder
 this Section 4.2(f) will be determined and credited to the Participant’s Account as of the last day of the PlanYear in which the Participant’s Separation from Service occurs.

Notwithstanding anything  in the Plan to the contrary, if Walmart reasonably anticipates that its deduction with respectto

 anticipates  that  the  deduction  of  such  distribution  would  not  be  barred  by  application  of  Code  Section162(m); provided, however, that the conditions of Section 5.5(a) are still satisfied as of such date.
5.6

 or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’s Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee determines thatthe
 Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding any provisions hereunder to thecontrary:
 (a)  the  Participant  shall  forfeit  all  Employer  Contribution  Credits  and  Incentive  Payments,  and  credited  Plan  earningsthereon;
 (b)  earnings  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Account  derived  from  Deferred  Compensation,  Deferred  Bonuses,  DeferredSpecial
 Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses and Deferred Equity shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amountwhich

 such Plan Year; and (c) if the Participant is then receiving installment payments, any remaining installments shall be recalculatedto
 reflect the amount which would otherwise have been paid if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the perannum
 rate in effect with respect to such installment payments. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of theParticipant’s Deferred Compensation, Deferred
 Bonuses, Deferred Special Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses or Deferred Equity.Any
 payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging(or not
 having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any Employer or any entity in which Walmart has anownership
 interest,  or during  such  additional  period  as provided  in Walmart’s  Statement  of  Ethics.  If the  Committee  determines,after
 payment  of  amounts  hereunder,  that  the  Participant  has  engaged  in  Gross  Misconduct  during  the  prescribed  period,  theParticipant
 (or the Participant’s beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitledunder this Section 5.6.

 1, 1997 - March 31, 1997 Plan Year shall be treated as one Plan Year running from February 1, 1996 -March 31, 1997.

by  liquidation  of  the  Participant’s  assets,  to  the  extent  the  liquidation  of  such  assets  would  itself  not  causesevere financial hardship; or
(3)
by cessation of deferrals under this Plan. The
 need  to  send  a  Participant’s  child  to  college  or  the  desire  to  purchase  a  home  does  not  constitute  an  UnforeseeableEmergency. The
 existence of an Unforeseeable Emergency will be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, basedupon

ARTICLE III.DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND BONUSES--
ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTS
3.1 
     Deferred Compensation.For each Plan Year, each Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of what would otherwi
se be the Eligible Officer’sfederal
 taxable base compensation, net of employment taxes and estimated bi-weekly deductions as are determined to be in effect onthe
 first day of the deferral period, to be paid for such Plan Year by Walmart or a Related Affiliate designated  by Walmart as aparticipating
 employer. Amounts deferred (the “Deferred Compensation”) will be deferred pro ratably for each payroll period of thePlan Year. All deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be filed with the Committee on forms approved by the Committee.
Deferral
 elections must be (a) filed no later than the day preceding the Plan Year for which the deferral election is to be effective; or(b)
 with  respect  to  an  Eligible  Officer  appointed  during  the  Plan  Year,  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  such  appointment.  Individualsappointed as Eligible Officers on or after April 1, 2003 and before October 1, 2003 shall have thirty (30) days from such latter date to
file a deferral election for the balance of the Plan Year.
Once
 made for a Plan Year, a deferral election may not be revoked, changed or modified. Notwithstanding the precedingsentence,
 in  the  event  an  Eligible  Officer  ceases  to  be  employed  as  an  Eligible  Officer,  such  former  Eligible  Officer’s  deferralelection
 shall automatically cease with respect to compensation earned on or after the individual ceases to be an Eligible Officer. Adeferral
 election for one (1) Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if deferrals aredesired
 for  a  subsequent  Plan  Year,  a  separate  election  must  be  made  by  the  Eligible  Officer  for  such  Plan  Year.  An  EligibleOfficer’s
 deferral election shall remain in effect with respect to any portion of base compensation paid while on a leave of absence,and,
 if  the  leave  of  absence  is  unpaid,  shall  resume  upon  return  from  the  leave  of  absence  during  the  same  Plan  Year  and  shallcontinue in effect for the balance of such Plan Year.
3.2 
     Deferred Bonuses.Each
 Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s bonus (if any) for a Fiscal Year under theWalmart
 Inc. Management Incentive Plan for Officers. All bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.2 must be made onforms
 approved by the Committee, and be filed with the Committee: (a) for the 1996-1997 Fiscal Year, no later than January 31,1996; (b) for Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1, 1997, no later than the March 31 of the Fiscal Year for which such bonus
(if
 any) is payable; and (c) within thirty (30) days of the individual’s appointment as an Eligible Officer if the Eligible Officer isnewly
 appointed after March 31 of the Fiscal Year. Individuals appointed as Eligible Officers on or after April 1, 2003 and beforeOctober
 1, 2003 shall have thirty (30) days from such latter date to file a bonus deferral election with respect to the February 1, 2003- January 31, 2004 Fiscal Year.
Once
 made  for  a  Fiscal  Year,  a  bonus  deferral  election  may  not  be  revoked,  changed  or  modified.  Notwithstanding  thepreceding
 sentence, in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed as an Eligible Officer but remains employed by Walmartor
 by one of its Related Affiliates, such former Eligible Officer’s bonus deferral election shall automatically cease with respect tothat portion of a bonus earned on or after the date the individual ceases to be an

Eligible Officer. For this purpose, the portion of a bonus earned on or after ceasing to be an Eligible Officer shall be determined bymultiplying
 the  bonus  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the  number  of  calendar  days  in  such  Fiscal  Year  in  which  theindividual ceased to
 be an Eligible Officer, and the denominator of which is the total calendar days in such Fiscal Year. Effective forthose
 bonuses  payable  for  Fiscal  Years  beginning  on  or  after  February  1,  2003,  in  the  event  an  Eligible  Officer  ceases  to  beemployed
 as an Eligible Officer due to a Termination of Employment, or if an Eligible Officer takes an approved leave of absence,such
 Eligible Officer’s bonus deferral election shall remain in effect with respect to that portion of a bonus earned while an EligibleOfficer,
 even if such bonus is awarded after a Termination of Employment or while an Eligible Officer is on an approved leave ofabsence.
With respect to those Eligible Officers appointed on or
 after the first day of a Plan Year and who elect to defer all or a portionof
 their bonus (if any) for that initial Fiscal Year, such deferral elections shall apply only to that portion of the bonus earned after thedate
 of such election, by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such FiscalYear
 in which the individual elected to defer all or a portion of their bonus after first becoming appointed as an Eligible Officer, andthe
 denominator of which is the total calendar days in such Fiscal Year. A bonus deferral election for one (1) Fiscal Year will notautomatically
 be given effect for a subsequent Fiscal Year, so that if deferrals are desired for a subsequent Fiscal Year, a separateelection must be made by the Eligible Officer for such Fiscal Year.
3.3 
     Establishment of Grandfathered Accounts.The
 Deferred  Compensation,  Deferred  Bonuses,  and  Incentive  Payments  will  be  credited  to  a  bookkeeping  account(“Grandfathe
red Account”) established by the Committee on behalf of each Participant. The Deferred Compensation will be creditedto
 the  Participant’s  Grandfathered  Account  as  of  the  last  day  of  the  Plan  Year  during  which  the  Deferred  Compensation  wouldotherwise
 be payable to the Participant. The Deferred Bonus will be credited to the Participant’s Grandfathered Account as of thedate
 the bonus would have otherwise been paid in cash. The Incentive Payments will be credited to the Participant’s GrandfatheredAccount
 as  of  the  last  day  of  the  Plan  Year  specified  in  Section  4.2.  A  Participant’s  Grandfathered  Account,  including  earningscredited thereto, will be maintained by the Committee until the Participant’s Plan benefits have been paid in full.
3.4 
     Nature of Grandfathered Accounts.Each
 Participant’s Grandfathered Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount to be paid aParticipant under
 this Plan. The Grandfathered Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of anykind. All amounts at any time attributable to a Participant’s Grandfathered Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart
and
 its Related Affiliates. A Participant’s rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. ThePlan represents an unsecured promise by Walmart and the applicable Related Affiliate to pay the benefits provided by the Plan.

3.5      Annual Valuation of Grandfathered Accounts.Each
 Participant’s  Grandfathered  Account  will  be  valued  annually  as  of  each  Annual  Valuation  Date.  The  value  of  anGrandfathered
 Account  as  of  any  applicable  Annual  Valuation  Date  is  the  sum  of  the  Grandfathered  Account  value  as  of  theimmediately
 preceding Annual Valuation Date, the Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses and Incentive Payments allocated asof the applicable Annual Valuation Date,
 and the equivalent of interest credited to the Grandfathered Account under Section 4.1 as ofthe
 applicable Annual Valuation Date, less any distributions for Unforeseeable Emergencies since the preceding Annual ValuationDate but on or before the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
[Notwithstanding
 anything herein to the contrary, effective April 1, 2008, Grandfathered Accounts shall be credited with interest ona
 daily basis. The amount of interest to be credited each day shall be a daily rate of simple interest based on the interest rate in effectfor
 the Plan Year as provided in Section 4.1. Also, effective January 1, 2009, the Plan Year for such purpose shall be the twelve-month
 period February 1 through January 31, with the period April 1, 2009 through January 31, 2010 being a short Plan Year. ThisAppendix
 A  shall  be  construed  in  accordance  with  such  modifications.  It  has  been  determined  that  these  modifications  do  notconstitute “material modifications” for purposes of Code Section 409A.]     
ARTICLE IV.
ADDITIONS TO ACCOUNTS -- CREDITED EARNINGS
AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS
4.1 
     Credited Annual Earnings.For
 each Plan Year a Participant’s Grandfathered Account will be credited with the equivalent of interest at the per annumrate
 established for such Plan Year by the Committee; provided, however, for the February 1, 1997 - March 31, 1997 Plan Year, theequivalent
 of interest shall be credited at one-sixth (1/6) of the per annum rate so established for such period. The per annum ratemay be
 increased or decreased for any Plan Year to reflect changes in prevailing interest rates, as determined at the sole discretion ofthe Committee. Except for a Plan Year in which a Participant receives a distributio
n due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, the amountto
 be credited to a Participant’s Grandfathered Account as of any Annual Valuation Date is the sum of: (a) the applicable per annumrate
 multiplied by the Participant’s Grandfathered Account value as of the immediately preceding Annual Valuation Date; (b) fiftypercent
 (50%) of the Participant’s Deferred Compensation for the Plan Year ending on the Annual Valuation Date multiplied by theapplicable
 full  annum  rate;  and  (c)  effective  for  Deferred  Bonuses  attributable  to  Fiscal  Years  beginning  on  or  after  February  1,2003,
 a pro rata amount of interest equivalent at the applicable per annum rate based upon the number of days from the date suchbonus would have otherwise been paid in cash through the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
[ 
NOTE :  The annual rate in effect for a Plan Year for this purpose shall be determined in accordance with the following formula ineffect
 as of October 3, 2004: the rate on 10-year Treasury notes determined as of the first business day of January preceding eachPlan
 Year, plus 270 basis points. Such formula shall not be modified on or after October 3, 2004. Notwithstanding the preceding, inlight of uncertainty regarding whether adjustment of the

annual rate would constitute a material modification of the Plan for Code Section 409A purposes, the annual rate was not adjustedfor 2005. The annual rate for 2006 and future years will be adjusted in accordance with the above formula.]
For
 a Plan Year in which a Participant receives a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, the amount to be creditedto the Participant’s
 Grandfathered Account as of the applicable Annual Valuation Date is the sum of: (a) an equivalent amount of prorata
 interest on the Participant’s Grandfathered Account value as of the preceding Annual Valuation Date based upon the number offull
 calendar months in the Plan Year which the Grandfathered Account was not reduced due to the distribution; (b) an equivalentamount of pro rata interest on
 the Grandfathered Account value immediately after the distribution based upon the number of calendarmonths
 in the Plan Year in which the Participant’s Grandfathered Account was reduced; (c) fifty percent (50%) of the Participant’sDeferred Compensation for
 the Plan Year ending on the Annual Valuation Date multiplied by the applicable full annum rate; and (d)effective
 for  Deferred  Bonuses  attributable  to Fiscal  Years  beginning  on or after  February  1,  2003,  a pro  rata  amount  of interestequivalent at the applicable per annum rate
 based upon the number of days from the date such bonus would have otherwise been paidin cash through the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
4.2 
     Incentive Payments.The
 Incentive  Payments  described  below  will  be  credited  to  a  Participant’s  Grandfathered  Account.  Incentive  Paymentsawarded
 and credited to a Participant’s Grandfathered Account under a Prior Agreement (such Incentive Payments were previouslyreferred
 to as “incentive bonuses” under the Prior Agreements), and credited interest thereon, will remain credited to a Participant’sGrandfathered
 Account hereunder as of January 31, 1996. Thereafter, a Participant’s entitlement to an Incentive Payment will begoverned
 by  this  Section  4.2,  including  any  Incentive  Payment  which  may  be  awarded  with  respect  to  recognized  DeferredCompensation
 (and credited earnings thereon) deferred under a Prior Agreement. Incentive Payments hereunder shall not duplicateany Incentive Payment awarded and credited under a Prior Agreement as of January 31, 1996.
(a)
The  Incentive  Payments  provided  in  this  Section  apply  to  a  Participant’s  recognized  Deferred  Compensation  andDeferred
 Bonuses for a Plan Year and credited Plan earnings thereon. For this purpose, Deferred Bonuses shall betreated
 as  being  “for  a  Plan  Year”  for  the  Plan  Year  in  which  Deferred  Bonuses  are  allocated  to  a  Participant’sGrandfathered
 Account  under  Section  3.3.  Incentive  Payments  are  separately  awarded  based  upon  a  Participant’srecognized
 Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for a given Plan Year and credited Plan earnings thereon.Solely
 for purposes of this Section 4.2, the February 1, 1996 - January 31, 1997 Plan Year and the short February 1,1997 - March 31, 1997 Plan Year shall be treated as one Plan Year running from February 1, 1996 - March 31, 1997.
(b)
The  amount of an Incentive Payment is based on the Participant’s recognized Deferred Compensation and DeferredBonuses
 for  a  Plan  Year,  plus  credited  Plan  earnings  on  such  sums  through  and  including  the  Incentive  Paymentaward date. The amount by which a Participant’s Deferred Compensation and Deferred

Bonuses  for  a  Plan  Year  exceeds  twenty  percent  (20%)  of  the  Participant’s  base  compensation  will  not  berecognized
 in computing an Incentive Payment. Base compensation for this purpose means the Participant’s annualbase rate
 of compensation for such Plan Year (proportionately increased for the special Plan Year of February 1, 1996-
 March 31, 1997). Credited Plan earnings on such nonrecognized Deferred Compensation or Deferred Bonuses arelikewise not taken into account in determining the amount of an Incentive Payment.
(c)
If  a  Participant  remains  continuously  employed  with  Walmart  or  its  Related  Affiliates  for  a  period  of  ten  (10)consecutive
 full Plan Years, beginning with the first day of the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a DeferredCompensation or Deferred Bonus
 election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the last dayof
 the tenth (10th) Plan Year of such period, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’s GrandfatheredAccount as of
 the last day of such tenth 10th Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%)of
 the Participant’s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for ten (10), but not less than five (5),Plan
 Years (i.e., the first six (6) Plan Years of such ten (10)-year period), plus credited Plan earnings thereon throughthe
 award  date.  For  each  full  Plan  Year  thereafter  in  which  the  Participant  remains  continuously  employed  withWalmart or its Related Affiliates, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’s Grandfathered Account as
of
 the last day of such Plan Year. Such Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Participant’srecognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred
 Bonuses for the first Plan Year of the five (5)-consecutive Plan Yearperiod ending on the award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the award date.
(d)
If  a  Participant  remains  continuously  employed  with  Walmart  or  its  Related  Affiliates  for  a  period  of  fifteen  (15)consecutive
 full Plan Years, beginning with the first day of the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a DeferredCompensation
 or Deferred Bonuses election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the lastday
 of  the  fifteenth  (15th)  Plan  Year  of  such  period,  an  Incentive  Payment  will  be  credited  to  the  Participant’sGrandfathered
 Account as of the last day of such fifteenth (15th) Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal toten
 percent (10%) of the Participant’s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for fifteen (15), butnot
 less than ten (10), Plan Years (i.e., the first six (6) Plan Years of such fifteen (15)-year period), plus credited Planearnings
 thereon  through  the  award  date.  For  each  full  Plan  Year  thereafter  in  which  the  Participant  remainscontinuously
 employed  with  Walmart  or  its  Related  Affiliates,  an  Incentive  Payment  will  be  credited  to  theParticipant’s Grandfathered
 Account as of the last day of such Plan Year. Such Incentive Payment will be equal to tenpercent (10%) of
 the Participant’s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for the first Plan Year ofa
 ten (10)-consecutive Plan Year period ending on the award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through theaward
 date. The Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(d) shall not take into account Incentive Paymentscredited under Section 4.2(c) or credited Plan earnings thereon.

(e)The  Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(e) only apply if a Participant has been a Participant under thePlan
 (or  a  Prior  Agreement)  for  five  (5)  or  more  full  Plan  Years  and  if  the  Participant  incurs  a  Retirement,  EarlyRetirement,
 death or Disability before satisfaction of the ten (10)- or fifteen (15)-year periods described in Sections4.2
 (c)  and  (d)  above,  after  taking  into  account  the  application  of  Section  4.2(f).  In  that  event,  only  the  IncentivePayment
 next to be credited (i.e., twenty percent (20%) or ten percent (10%)) will be credited to the Participant’sGrandfathered
 Account as provided in this Section 4.2(e). In the event the Participant had not yet been awarded orcredited with a twenty percent (20 %) Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(c), the Incentive Payment provided by this
Section
 4.2(e) will be based upon the ratio of (1) the number of full Plan Years worked since and including the firstPlan
 Year in which the Participant had a Deferred Compensation or Deferred Bonus election in effect under this Planor a Prior Agreement, to (2)
 ten (10), multiplied by twenty percent (20%). Such Incentive Payment will be based uponrecognized
 amounts for the Plan Years which would otherwise have been considered in calculating the Participant’sfirst
 Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(c). If the Participant has been awarded a twenty percent (20 %) IncentivePayment
 provided in Section 4.2 (c), the Incentive Payment . provided by this Section 4.2(e) will be based upon theratio
 of (1) the number of full Plan Years worked since the award date of the initial twenty percent (20%) IncentivePayment,
 to  (2)  five  (5),  multiplied  by  ten  percent  (10%).  Such  Incentive  Payment  will  be  based  upon  recognizedamounts
 for  the  Plan  Years  which  would  otherwise  have  been  considered  in  calculating  the  Participant’s  firstIncentive Payment under Section 4.2(d). The Incentive Payment provided under this Section 4.2(e) will be determined
and
 credited to the Participant’s Grandfathered Account as of the date the Participant’s Plan benefits are distributed ina
 lump sum payment. If, however, a Participant’s benefits are to be distributed in installments, the amounts providedunder this
 Section 4.2(e) will be determined and credited to the Participant’s Grandfathered Account as of the January31 on which installments are based.
(f)
The  Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(f) apply only with respect to those Participants who: (1) incur aTermination of
 Employment on or after the last day of a Fiscal Year, but before the immediately following last day ofa
 Plan Year (e.g., on or after January 31, but before the next March 31); and (2) who, but for such Termination ofEmployment
 before the last day of a Plan Year, would have been credited with an Incentive Payment under Section4.2(c)
 and/or  4.2(d).  In  that  event,  the  Incentive  Payments  which  would  have  been  credited  to  the  Participant’sGrandfathered
 Account  but  for  such  early  Termination  of  Employment  will  be  credited  to  the  Participant’sGrandfathered
 Account as if the Participant had remained employed with Walmart or its Related Affiliates throughthe last
 day of the Plan Year, with no reduction due to the early Termination of Employment. The Incentive Paymentsprovided
 under this Section 4.2(f) will be determined and credited to the Participant’s Grandfathered Account as ofthe date
 the Participant’s Plan benefits are distributed in a lump sum payment. If, however, a Participant’s benefits areto be distributed in installments, the amounts provided under this Section 4.2(f) will be determined and credited to the

Participant’s Grandfathered Account as of the January 31 on which installments are based.[ 
NOTE :  Incentive Payments are frozen under this Appendix A. From and after January 1, 2005, all Incentive Paymentsshall be made under the Plan, not this Appendix A.

(i)
establish  the formula for determining the amounts payable based on the level of achievement of the applicablePerformance Goal; or
(ii)
for  any one or more Participants, subject to Section 4.2(a), establish a formula for determining the maximumamount
 payable (an “umbrella plan”) based on the level of achievement of the applicable Performance Goal,and
 set a methodology  for  determining  the  actual  amount  payable  (a “plan  within  a plan”)  which  may,  butneed not, be based on Performance Measures; or
(iii)
for  any two or more Participants (“Pool Participants”), establish a performance award pool, which shall be anunfunded pool, the aggregate 
amount of which shall be based upon the achievement of the Performance 3

Goal. The Committee may specify the amount of the pool as a percentage of any such Performance Measure, apercentage
 thereof in excess of a threshold amount, or an another amount that need not bear a mathematicalrelationshi
p to such Performance Measure(s). The maximum amount payable to any Pool Participant may be astated
 percentage  of  the  pool,  or  a  percentage  (or  multiple)  of  the  Pool  Participant’s  target  Incentive  PlanAward,
 or of the Pool Participant’s compensation or any element(s) thereof; provided the sum of the amountsallocable to
 Pool Participants as Incentive Plan Awards shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the pool, andshall not exceed the per-person award limit in Section 4.2(a).
(iv)
With  respect  to each  Incentive  Plan  Award,  the  Committee  shall:  (A)  determine  the  consequences  for  theIncentive
 Plan  Award  of  the  Participant’s  change  in  employment  status  as  provided  in  Section  4.2(b);  (B)specify
 the consequences for the Award of the occurrence of a change in control of the Employer during aPerformance
 Period; and (C) establish such other terms and conditions for the Incentive Plan Award as theCommittee deems appropriate.
(v)
For  Incentive Plan Awards intended to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption, each of the foregoing shallbe
 accomplished within the time period required to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption. With respect to Participants
 who are not Potential Covered Employees, and for Incentive Plan Awards not intended to qualifyfor
 the Section 162(m) Exemption, the Committee may establish other subjective or objective goals, includingindividual Performance Goals, 
as it deems appropriate, which need not be based on Performance Measures. (b)
Certification of Performance Goal Achievement. The Committee shall, promptly after the date on which the necessary financial, individual, or other information for a particular Performance Period becomes available, and in any event
prior to the payment of any Incentive Plan Award intended to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption to a Covered
Employee, determine and certify the degree to which each of the Performance Goals has been attained.
(c)
Permitted Adjustments. Except as permitted under Section 4.2, Incentive Plan Awards shall be paid solely in accordance with the applicable formula or umbrella plan or the pool 
for the Performance Period, based upon the level of achievement of Performance Goals. Performance Goals, to the extent determined based on accounting standards or
principles, shall be based upon generally accepted accounting principles, or international financial accounting
standards, as applicable. However, unless the Committee specifies otherwise 
within the time period required to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption, 
Performance Goals shall be adjusted by the Committee to take into account the effect of the following, 
to the extent the adjustment items exceed thresholds for adjustment established by the Committee when the Performance Goals are established: changes in accounting standards that may be required by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board after the Performance
4

Goal is established; realized investment gains and/or losses; extraordinary, unusual, non-recurring or infrequent items;currency fluctuations; acquisitions; divestitures; litigation losses; financing activities; expenses for restructuring or
productivity initiatives; other non-operating items; new laws, cases, or regulatory developments that result in
unanticipated items of gain, loss, income, or expense; executive severance arrangements; investment returns relating
to investment vehicles which are unaffiliated with a Company or divisional operating strategy; bonus expense; the
impact on pre-tax income of interest expense attributable to the repurchase of Company stock; extraordinary
dividends or stock dividends; the effect of corporate reorganizations or restructuring, spinoff, or a sale of a business
unit; and other items as the Committee determines at the time the Performance Goal is established 
to be required so that the operating results of the Company, division, or a Related Affiliate shall be computed on a comparative basis
from Performance Period to Performance Period; in each case as those terms are defined under generally accepted
accounting principles 
or, if applicable, international financial accounting standards, and provided in each case that such excluded items are objectively determinable by reference to the Company’s financial statements, notes to the
Company’s financial statements, and/or management’s discussion and analysis in the Company’s financial statements.
Determination by the Committee or its designee shall be final and conclusive on all parties, but shall be based on
relevant objective information or financial data.
4.2. 
Maximum Incentive Plan Award; Committee Discretion . (a)
Maximum Incentive Plan Award. In no event will an Incentive Plan Award for a Covered Employee intended to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption exceed $20,000,000 for a 12-month Performance Period (or in the case of a
Performance Period other than 12 months long, an amount that bears the same ratio to $20,000,000 as the length of
the Performance Period bears to 12 months).
(b)
Change in Employment Status. The Committee shall have the discretion and authority to determine the consequences for the Incentive Plan Award of a Participant’s: 
(i) termination of employment for various reasons or the Participant’sdisability, or the Participant’s demotion or promotion during the Performance Period; (ii) 
leaving the Employer and being rehired as a Participant; (iii) being hired, promoted, or transferred into a position eligible for MIP participation;
(iv) 
transferring between eligible MIP positions with different incentive percentages or Performance Goals; (v) transferring to a position not eligible to participate in the MIP; (vi) 
becoming eligible for an incentive from another incentive plan maintained by the Company or Related Affiliate; (vii) being

suspension at the time payment would otherwise be made, no payment shall be made until the matter is resolved by
the Employer, and it is determined whether the Incentive Plan Award shall be paid or forfeited.
5

(c)Committee Discretion. The Committee shall have the discretion to reduce, eliminate, or increase any Incentive Plan Award for any individual or group, to reflect individual performance and/or unanticipated factors, including but not
limited to those described in Section 4.1(c), or in the case of a plan within a plan, to implement the methodology for
determining the actual amount of a Participant’s Incentive Plan Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to
the following sentence, with respect to the Incentive Plan Awards of Potential Covered Employees intended to qualify
for the Section 162(m) Exemption, the Committee shall not increase such awards above the amount determined under
the applicable formula, umbrella plan, or pool 
for the Performance Period, or (except in case of death or a change in control) waive the achievement of applicable Performance Goals. In the event a Potential Covered Employee is
determined at the end of the Performance Period not to be a Covered Employee, and to the extent it would not cause
the Potential Covered Employee to become a Covered Employee, the Committee may exercise its discretion to
increase the amount of such Potential Covered Employee’s Incentive Plan Award above the amount generated under
the applicable formula for the Performance Period.
4.3. 
Payment of Award .     (a)
Usual Timing . For any recipient subject to U. S. federal income tax, unless payment of the Incentive Plan Award is duly deferred by the Participant under an applicable deferred compensation arrangement, Incentive Plan Awards will
be paid by the Participant’s Employer in cash or cash equivalent no later than two and one-half months after the later
of (a) the end of the calendar year in which the applicable Performance Period ends or (b) the end of the Fiscal Year
in which the Performance Period ends. The Committee may establish different payment schedules for different
Participants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is contemplated that for any Performance Period ending on January 31,
payment to recipients subject to U. S. federal income tax will be made by the following April 15. If any portion of an
Incentive Plan Award payable to a Covered Employee that is intended to qualify for the 162(m) Exemption for any
reason is not deductible under Section 162(m), payment of that portion shall, in the Committee’s discretion, be
deferred until the earliest date it may be paid and deducted.
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, Incentive Plan Awards will be paid without interest.
(b)
Certain Participants not Eligible. To be eligible for payment of any Incentive Plan Award, the Participant must (i) be employed by the Company or a Related Affiliate on the last day of the Performance Period to which the Incentive
Plan Award pertains, except that in the event of a Participant’s death, the Incentive Plan Award shall be prorated
based upon the number of full payroll periods worked as a Participant during the Performance Period prior to death,
(ii) have performed the Participant’s duties to the satisfaction of the Committee, (iii) have not engaged in any act
deemed by the Committee to be inimical to the best interest of the Company or a Related Affiliate, (iv) have not
breached any restrictive covenant or confidentiality requirement to which the Participant is subject, and (v 
) otherwisehave complied with Company and
6

Employer policies at all times prior to the actual payment of the Incentive Plan Award.(c)

Committee deems inimical to the best interest of the Company or a Related Affiliate, or (B) violated any of the
requirements of Section 4.3(b), or (ii) that the Participant, whether before or after payment of such Incentive Plan
Award 
failed to comply with Company and Employer policies, the recipient of the Incentive Plan Award shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the amount of such Incentive Plan Award to the Employer that paid it. 
In addition, all Incentive Plan Awards, whether or not previously paid, and whether or not previously deferred, shall be subject to
the Company’s policies or requirements or applicable law (including regulations and other applicable guidance)
regarding clawbacks (recoupment) as in effect from time to time.
5. ADMINISTRATION
5.1. 
Administration . The MIP shall be administered by the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the MIP, the Committee shall have full discretionary authority to administer and interpret the MIP, to exercise all powers either specifically
granted to it under the MIP or as are necessary or advisable in the administration of the MIP, to decide the facts in any case
arising under the MIP, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the MIP, to correct errors or omissions, to
require performance reports on which it can base its determinations under Section 4.1, and to make all other determinations
necessary or advisable for the administration of the MIP (including but not limited to determinations with respect to whether and
under what circumstances or conditions a Participant has had a termination of employment for purposes of the MIP), all of which
shall be binding on all persons, including the Company, Related Affiliates, the Participants (or any person claiming any rights
under the MIP from or through any Participant), and any shareholder of the Company. The Committee’s administration of the
MIP, including all rules and regulations, interpretations, selections, determinations, approvals, decisions, delegations,
amendments, terminations, and other actions, shall be final and binding on the Company and its shareholders, Related Affiliates,
and all associates of any Employer, including Participants and their beneficiaries. A majority of the Committee shall constitute a
quorum, and, provided a quorum is present, the Committee shall act pursuant to a majority vote of those present or by unanimous
written consent. No member of the Board or Committee shall be liable for any action taken or determination made in good faith
with respect to the MIP or any Incentive Plan Award.
5.2. 
Allocation and Delegation; Sub-Plans . (a)
Allocation. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law (including regulations and other applicable guidance) or the applicable listing standards of 
a stock exchange, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members.
(b)
Delegation; Sub-Plans. Provided that the Committee shall not delegate authority or responsibility for Incentive Plan Awards of Potential Covered Employees intended to
7

qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption, the Committee may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities andpowers under the MIP to one or more persons as the Committee deems appropriate. Delegates need not meet the
independence or outside director requirements applicable to the Committee. The Committee may establish and
administer sub-plans for such groups or classes of eligible associates as the Committee may specify, and may
establish different Performance Periods, Performance Measures, and Performance Goals and payment schedules
thereunder, which may be modified as deemed appropriate to conform to foreign law or practice. The Committee may
also 
delegate responsibility and authority to such persons as it deems appropriate for establishing and administering any such sub-plans, including with respect to such sub-plans, authority to exercise upward or downward discretion in
determining the final amount of an Incentive Plan Award thereunder.
(c)
Revocation. The Committee may at any time revoke any allocation or delegation. 6. MISCELLANEOUS
6.1. 
Amendment and Termination . (a)
Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend or terminate the MIP (in whole or in part) without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.1. Neither the
Company nor any Related Affiliate is obligated to continue this MIP.
(b)
Shareholder Approval. Any amendment to the MIP that changes the class of associates of an Employer eligible to participate, changes the Performance Goals, Performance Measures, or increases the maximum dollar amount that
may be paid to a Participant for a Performance Period shall not be effective with respect to Incentive Plan Awards to
Covered Employees intended to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption unless the amendment is approved by
shareholders as provided in Section 1.3 before the Incentive Plan Award is paid. 
    6.2. 
Effect of Incentive Plan Awards on Other Compensation . (a)
Not Taken into Account Under Other Plans. Awards shall not be considered eligible pay under other plans, benefit arrangements, or fringe benefit arrangements of the Company or a Related Affiliate, unless otherwise provided under
the terms of other plans.
(b)
Compensation Reduction and Compensation Deferral Elections Apply to Incentive Plan Awards. To the extent provided in the applicable benefit or deferred compensation plan or arrangement of the Company or a Related
Affiliate, amounts payable as Incentive Plan Awards will be reduced or deferred in accordance with the Participant’s
compensation reduction election or compensation deferral election, if any, in effect under other plans and
arrangements at the time the Incentive Plan Award is paid.
8

(c)Sole Incentive Plan. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, associates shall      not be eligible to participate inthe MIP for any period they are participating in any 
     other incentive program maintained by the Company or anyRelated Affiliate.
6.3. 
No Guarantee, No Funding . The payment of an Incentive Plan Award for any Performance Period does not guarantee any person eligibility for or payment of an Incentive Plan Award for any other Performance Period. Incentive Plan
Awards shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Participant’s Employer, to the extent the payments are attributable to
services for the Employer. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from an Employer under the MIP, the
right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor. No absolute right to any Incentive Plan Award shall be
considered as having accrued to any Participant prior to the payment of the Incentive Plan Award.
6.4. 
Taxes . (a)
Withholding. The Participant’s Employer shall have the right to deduct from all payments made under the MIP any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the payments.
(b)
Section 409A. The MIP is intended to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Section 409A”) and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the MIP shall be construed and
interpreted in accordance with such intent. If payment of any amount of “deferred compensation” (as defined under
Section 409A, after giving effect to the exemptions thereunder) is triggered by a separation from service (as defined
under Section 409A) that occurs while the Participant is a “specified employee” with respect to the Company (as
defined under Section 409A), and if such amount is scheduled to be paid within six (6) months after such separation
from service, the amount shall accrue without interest and shall be paid the first business day after the end of such six-
month period, or, if earlier, within 15 days after the appointment of the personal representative or executor of the
Participant’s estate following the Participant’s death.
(c)
Participant Solely Responsible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall be solely responsible for the satisfaction of any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes on payments under the MIP. 
By way of example and not limitation, in no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalties that may be
imposed on the Participant by Code Section 4999 (golden parachute payments) or by Code Section 409A or any
damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A
6.5. 
Governing Law . The MIP and all rights to an Incentive Plan Award hereunder shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by federal law.
6.6. 
Awards Not Transferable . Subject to Section 6.8, a Participant’s rights and interest under the MIP may not be assigned or transferred. Any attempted assignment or transfer shall
9

be null and void and shall extinguish, in the Committee’s sole discretion, the Employer’s obligation under the MIP to payIncentive Plan Awards with respect to the Participant.
6.7. 
Employment . Neither the adoption of the MIP nor its operation shall in any way affect the rights and power of the Company or any Related Affiliate to dismiss or discharge any Participants. The MIP is not a contract between the Company
or any Related Affiliate and any associate of the Company or Related Affiliate or Participant.
6.8. 
Beneficiary . In the event of a Participant’s death prior to the payment of any Incentive Plan Award to which the Participant is otherwise entitled, payment shall be made to the Participant’s then-effective beneficiary or beneficiaries under the
Employer-paid group term life insurance arrangement.

(b)
At  its meeting on March 3, 2010, the Committee approved the amendment of this Plan to provide that no further Feesshall
 be paid or Shares awarded under this Plan on or after June 4, 2010. From and after that date, cash Fees will bepaid
 to Directors as approved by the Board from time to time and Share grants to Directors will be awarded by theBoard
 under  the  Stock  Incentive  Plan  (subject  to  approval  of  an  amendment  to  the  Stock  Incentive  Plan  bystockholders).
(c)
The  Committee  has  authority  pursuant  to  Section  7.8  of  the  Stock  Incentive  Plan  to  adopt  procedures  as  it  deemsappropriate to allow Directors to defer their Fees (whether in cash or Shares) paid or awarded on or after June 4, 2010,
in
 accordance with Code Section 409A. Pursuant to such authority, the Committee amended and restated this Plan toprovide
 for deferral of Fees paid or awarded on or after June 4, 2010 and renamed the Plan the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.Director
 Compensation Deferral Plan. This Plan was renamed the Walmart Inc. Director Compensation Deferral Planeffective February 1, 2018.

To  the extent Shares are distributed pursuant to this Plan on or after June 4, 2010, such Shares shall be treated asbeing
 authorized from the plan under which they were awarded, that is, for Shares awarded prior to June 4, 2010, theDirector

 former Director’s last Fees shall be reduced pro rata if the Director elected a whole dollar amount and the Feesare
 reduced, for example, due to the Director not completing the full period of service to which the Fees relate). Anelection
 for one Plan Year shall not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if deferral isdesired
 for  a  subsequent  Plan  Year,  a  separate  election  must  be  made  by  the  Director  for  such  Plan  Year.  If  noelection
 is made for a Plan Year, the Director shall be deemed to have elected not to defer any of his or her Fees paidduring such Plan Year.
The
 deferral  election  filed  by a new  Director  under  subsection  (b)(2)  above  with  respect  to Fees  paid  on aquarterly
 basis shall apply only to the Fees payable to such Director for services rendered as a Director subsequent tothe date
 of the Director’s election. For this purpose, the amount of Fees payable to such Director for services renderedsubsequent
 to  the  Director’s  election  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying  the  amount  payable  on  the  first  quarterlypayment
 date  following  the  date  of the  Director’s  election  by a fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is the  number  ofcalendar
 days beginning on the date of the election and ending on the quarterly payment date, and the denominator ofwhich
 is the total number of calendar days that the Director served as a Director in the quarter ending on the quarterlypayment date.
(d)
For  purposes of this Section 3.1, the date of a Director’s election is the date the executed election form is received bythe Committee.

 interest,  or  during  such  additional  period  as  provided  in  Walmart’s  Statement  of  Ethics.  In  the  event  the  Committeedetermines

B. 
You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  Walmart  or,  if  different,  the  Employer,  the  ultimateliability
 for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related itemsrelated
 to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), is and remains your responsibility andmay
 exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer(a)

 to  Walmart  and  the  Employer  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related  Items.  In  this  regard,  you  authorize  Walmart  and/or  theEmployer
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related
 Items  by  withholding  of  Shares  to  be  issued  upon  settlement  of  the  vested  Restricted  Stock.  In  the  event  that  suchwithholding
 in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, byyour
 acceptance of the Restricted Stock and this Agreement, you authorize and direct: (a) Walmart and any broker or other thirdparty
 designated  by  Walmart  to  sell  on  your  behalf  a  whole  number  of  Shares  corresponding  to  the  vested  Restricted  Stock  thatWalmart
 or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-RelatedItems;

and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by anyother method of
 withholding, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart orany Affiliate.

Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby considering
 applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicablerates. Further,
 if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to havebeen
 issued  the  full  number  of  Shares  subject  to  the  vested  Restricted  Stock,  notwithstanding  that  a  number  of  the  Shares  arewithheld
 solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess amount of taxis withheld, such excess tax will be reported and
 paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the event that any excessamounts
 are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheldamount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by themeans
 previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to complywith your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

5. 
Adjustment and Vesting of the PRSUs and Delivery of Shares . A. 
Performance  Period and Achievement Rates .  The Committee establishes the Performance Goals and PerformanceMeasures applicable to your PRSUs. You
 will receive by separate writing a notification of the performance criteria applicableto
 your PRSUs in respect of the Performance Period set forth above which reflects the fiscal year of Walmart or, if different,the
 Affiliate that employs you (the “Employer”). The Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof)and Performance Goals as set forth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
The
 number of PRSUs that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that ultimately may be delivered to you shalldepend
 upon the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordancewith
 the Plan, for each Performance Measure during the Performance Period. With respect to each applicable PerformanceMeasure during the Performance Period:
1. 
“Threshold”  performance means the achievement of the lowest possible Performance Goal established bythe Committee;
2. 
“Target” performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and 3. 
“Maximum”  performance means the highest possible achievement of the Performance Goal established bythe Committee.
An
 achievement  rate  is  determined  for  each  Performance  Measure  applicable  to  your  Plan  Award  in  respect  of  thePerformance
 Period.  The  achievement  rate  value  applied  to  each  weighted  Performance  Measure  during  the  PerformancePeriod
 is  expressed  as  a  percentage  and  may  range  from  0%  (for  achieving  less  than  Threshold  Performance),  50%  (forachieving
 at least, but no less than, Threshold performance), 100% (for achieving Target performance), or up to 150% (forachieving
 Maximum performance). A percentage of 0% shall be applied to a Performance Measure during the PerformancePeriod if Threshold performance is not achieved. The weighted average of all applicable
2

achievement rates during the Performance Period is referred to herein as the “Performance Achievement Rate.”At the end of the Performance Period, the number of PRSUs that wer
e granted to you shall be adjusted to reflect the degree towhich
 applicable Performance Goals have been attained by multiplying :  (x) the Performance Achievement Rate and (y) thenumber
 of  PRSUs  granted  by  this  Agreement.  Subject  to  Paragraph  10  below,  and  provided  you  have  not  incurred  aForfeiture
 Condition before the Vesting Date, the adjusted number of PRSUs (the “Adjusted PRSUs”) represent the numberof Shares you shall receive, as described in Paragraph 5.C below.
B. 
Vesting  of  the  Adjusted  PRSUs .  Subject  to  Paragraph  7  and  provided  you  have  not  incurred  a  ForfeitureCondition, your Adjusted PRSUs will vest on the Vesting Date set forth above.
C. 
Delivery  of Shares .  Upon the vesting of your Plan Award, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Sharesequal
 to the number of Adjusted PRSUs as calculated in Paragraph 5.A. above less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy taxwithholding

Forfeiture  Condition .  Subject  to  Paragraph  8  below,  any  PRSUs  that  would  otherwise  vest  in  whole  or  in  part  on  theVesting Date, if any, will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A. 
your  Continuous  Status  terminates  for  any  reason  (other  than  death  or  Disability,  to  the  extent  provided  inParagraph 8 below); or
B. 
you  have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to beprovided to you by Walmart.
Each

 of this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that vesting of thisPlan Award is further conditioned
3

upon  your  execution  and  delivery  to  Walmart  of  a  Post  Termination  Agreement  and  Covenant  Not  to  Compete,  in  a  form  to  beprovided to
 you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not toCompete
 prior  to  the  Vesting  Date  shall  also  be  deemed  a  “Forfeiture  Condition”  for  purposes  of  this  Agreement.  Upon  theoccurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such PRSUs or the underlying Shares.
7. 
Administrative  Suspension .  If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your PRSUs may be suspendedas of the date
 you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of theadministrative suspension period, your PRSUs may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to such
PRSUs
 or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspensionperiod,
 then the vesting of your PRSUs will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any PRSUs that would have vested while youwere
 on  administrative  suspension  will  vest  and  the  corresponding  number  of  Shares  will  be  delivered  to  you  as  soon  asadministratively
 feasible,  but  in  any  event  within  74  days  of  the  end  of  the  administrative  suspension  period  which  shall  beconsidered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8. 
Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability . Your PRSUs will vest
 earlier than described in Paragraph 5.B. above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a Vesting Date, if yourContinuous
 Status  is  terminated  by  your  death  or  Disability  prior  to  the  Vesting  Date  and  you  have  not  incurred  a  ForfeitureCondition. The number of Shares you will become vested in under this Paragraph 8 shall be determined as follows:
A. 
Any  PRSUs that are scheduled to vest within 90 days of the date that your Continuous  Status is terminated  byreason
 of  your  death  or  Disability  will  become  immediately  vested; provided,  however ,  that  if  the  determination  ofattainment
 of Performance Goals has not yet been determined for your Plan Award, then achievement of Target performancefor all applicable Performance Goals shall be assumed for purposes of this Paragraph 8.A; and
B. 
Any  PRSUs that are scheduled to vest more than 90 days but within the same fiscal year as the date on which yourContinuous Status was
 terminated by reason of your death or Disability shall vest and the number of Shares you shall receivewill
 be prorated by dividing: (x) the number of calendar days from the Grant Date to the date your Continuous Status wasterminated 
by (y)  the  number  of  calendar  days  from  the  Grant  Date  through  the  Vesting  Date  set  forth  above; provided, however 
,  that  if  the  determination  of  attainment  of  Performance  Goals  has  not  yet  occurred  for  your  Plan  Award,  thenachievement
 of Target performance  for all applicable Performance  Goals shall be assumed for purposes of this Paragraph8.B.
For
 purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of your death or the dateon
 which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of your Disability. For purposes ofthis
 Agreement, “Disability” shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments under the long-term disability plan orpolicy,
 as it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the Employer, regardless of whether you are covered bysuch policy.  If Walmart or, if different, the
4

Employer does not have a long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement, “Disability”  means that you are unable tocarry
 out the responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of any medically determined physical or mentalimpairment
 for  a  period  of  not  less  than  one  hundred  and  eighty  (180)  consecutive  days.   You  shall  not  be  considered  to  haveincurred
 a  Disability  unless  you  furnish  proof  of  such  impairment  sufficient  to  satisfy  Walmart  in  its  sole  discretion.  If  yourContinuous
 Status is terminated due to a Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global Equity team. Notwithstandingany
 provision  of  this  Agreement,  Walmart  will  not  accelerate  your  Plan  Award  if  Walmart  has  not  received  notification  of  yourtermination
 within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to process the settlement of your PlanAward to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
9. 
Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates . A. 
Permanent  Transfers  and  Continuous  Status .  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  a  permanent  transfer  of  ContinuousStatus from
 Walmart, or the Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute atermination of your Continuous Status.
B. 
Applicable  Performance  Measures  and  Goals  Upon  Permanent  Transfer .  If  you  permanently  transfer  yourContinuous Status
 during the Performance Period, then the performance criteria and the resulting adjustment will be proratedand/or
 adjusted  to  reflect  the  proportion  of  the  Performance  Period  during  which  you  provided  service  to  Walmart,  or,  ifdifferent,
 the  Affiliate  that  initially  employed  you  (the  “Initial  Employer”)  and  the  proportion  of  the  Performance  Periodduring
 which  you  provided  service  to  Walmart  or,  if  different,  the  Affiliate  to  which  you  permanently  transferred  (the“Subsequent Employer”).
C. 
Permanent  Transfers  to  Affiliate  or  Position  where  Performance-Based  Awards  are  Not  Granted .  If  youpermanently
 transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are notgranted,
 the performance criteria applicable for the remaining portion of your Performance Period shall be communicated toyou, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described in Paragraph 9.B above.
D. 
Transfers  to New Position with Same Employer .  If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as definedherein)
 but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightingsthereof)
 and  Performance  Goals,  then  the  performance  criteria  applicable  for  the  remaining  portion  of  your  PerformancePeriod
 shall be communicated to you, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described inParagraph 9.B above.
10. 
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your PRSUs and acknowledgethat you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B. 
You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  Walmart  (or  if  different,  the  Employer),  the  ultimateliability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll
5

tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legallyapplicable
 to you (“Tax-Related Items”) is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld byWalmart
 or  the  Employer.  You  further  acknowledge  that  Walmart  and/or  the  Employer  (a)  make  no  representations  orundertakings
 regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the PRSUs, including, butnot
 limited  to,  the  grant,  vesting  or  settlement  of  the  PRSUs,  the  subsequent  sale  of  Shares  acquired  pursuant  to  suchsettlement and
 the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of thePRSUs
 or any aspect of the PRSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular taxresult.
 Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/orthe Employer (or your former employer,
 as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in morethan one jurisdiction.
C. 
Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart, to satisfyany
 applicable  withholding  obligations  with  regard  to  all  Tax-Related  Items  by  withholding  of  Shares  to  be  issued  uponsettlement
 of  the  Adjusted  PRSUs.  In  the  event  that  such  withholding  in  Shares  is  problematic  under  applicable  tax  orsecurities law
 or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the PRSUs and this Agreement, youauthorize
 and direct (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a wholenumber
 of  Shares  corresponding  to  the  Adjusted  PRSUs  that  Walmart  or  the  Employer  determines  to  be  appropriate  togenerate
 cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, ortheir respective agents, at their
 sole discretion to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding, includingthrough withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for the Tax-RelatedItems
 by  considering  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholding  rates  or  other  applicable  withholding  rates,  includingmaximum
 applicable  rates.  Further,  if  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  is  satisfied  by  withholding  in  Shares,  for  taxpurposes, you
 are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Adjusted PRSUs, notwithstanding thata
 number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. In the event that any excessamounts
 are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any overwithheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, ifyou fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
