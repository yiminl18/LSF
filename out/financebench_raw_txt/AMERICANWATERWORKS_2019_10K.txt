ITEM 1.
BUSINESS The Company
With a history dating back 
to 1886 , American Water is th e largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company inthe
 United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936 ,  the Companyemploys approximately 
6,800  professionals who provide drinking wat er, wastewater and other related services to approximately 15 million  people in 46  states. TheCompany
 conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as the “Regulated Businesses
.” The  Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of areportable
 segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as the “Market- Based Businesses
,” which is consistent with how manage ment assesses the results of these businesses.Throughout this Form
 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean AmericanWater Works Company, Inc. and i
ts subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., withoutits subsidiaries.
Regulated Businesses
The
 Company’s  primary  business  involves  the  ownership  of  utilities  that  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  to  residential,  commercial,  industrial,public
 authority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Company’s utilities operate in approximately 1,700  communities  in 16  states in the United States,with
 over 3.4  million active  customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiplestate
 utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). Federal, state and localgovernments
 also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities inthe 
Regulated Businesses segment.  Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses  were $3,094 million  for 2019, $2,984 million for 2018 and $2,958 million  for 2017
, accounting for 86% , 87% and 88% , respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.Presented
 in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses ’  operating revenues and the number of customers the Company serves,by type of service, for and as o

The Company’s 
Regulated Businesses  have  a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality orany other entity that purchases the Company’s water or wa
stewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase theCompany’s services for use by mul
tiple individuals or businesses, such as homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.4

Table of ContentsThe
 vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage,typically
 on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meterswith
 mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption datato
 proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or basedupon their water consumption.
Residential
 customers make up a substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i)commercial
 customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers,where
 the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in firesuppression
 systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv)public
 authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community waterand wastewater systems in the 
form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater, for their own customers.The following chart depicts 
the allocation of the Company’s Regulated Businesses ’ operating revenue of $3,094 million  by type, including a breakout of thetotal water services

mers.5

Table of ContentsCustomer
 growth in the Company’s Regulated  Businesses is  primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of waterand/or wastewater utili
ty systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.Capital Investment
Excluding
 acquisitions, the Company plans to invest $8.2 billion  over  the next five years and between $18 billion  and $19 billion  over  the next 10 years,including 
$1.6  billion in 2020,  for  capital  improvements  to  its Regulated  Businesses’  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure,  largely  for  pipe  replacement  andupgrading
 aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle in2009 to
 an expected 115-year replacement cycle by 2024, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,000 miles of mains and collection pipesbetween 2020 and 2024. In addition, from
 2020 to 2024, the Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilitiesis
 expected  to  increase,  further  addressing  infrastructure  renewal,  resiliency,  water  quality,  operational  efficiency,  technology  and  innovation,  and  emergingregulatory
 compliance needs. Additionally, the Company is investing significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variabilityby
 hardening its assets. Recently completed projects include the $25 million raised floodwall project at New Jersey’s Raritan Millstone Water Treatment Plantwhich
 provides  protection  against  a  500  year  flood,  and  the  $15  million  Bel  Air,  Maryland  Reservoir  project  which  provides  90  million  gallons  of  droughtmitigation water stor
age for the region.Regulation and Rate Making
The
 operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses  are  generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primaryresponsibility
 of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ fromstate
 to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital,operation
 and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions,along
 with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time. Thesepolicies will affec
t the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.Periodic
 changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typicallydetermined
 by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investmentcosts,
 changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the time betweenthe occurrence of an ev
ent that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates.6

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag.Presented in the table be
low are examples of approved regulatory practices:Regulatory Practices
 Description  States Allowed Infrastructure replacement
surcharges
 Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made toreplace
 infrastructure  necessary  to  sustain  safe,  reliable  services  for  the  Company’s  customers.  These  mechanisms  typicallyinvolve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency.
 IA, IL, IN, KY, MO,NJ, NY, PA, TN, VA,
WV
Future test year
 A test period used for setting rates, which begins with the date new rates are effective. This allows current or projected revenues,expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more t
imely basis. CA, HI, IA, IL, IN,KY, NY, PA, TN, VA
Hybrid test year
 Allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year. MD, MO, NJ, WVUtility plant recovery
mechanisms
 Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance forfunds
 used during construction. In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects andassociated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.
 CA, IL, KY, NY, PA,TN, VA
Expense mechanisms
 Allows  changes  in  certain  operating  expenses,  which  may  fluctuate  based  on  conditions  beyond  the  utility’s  control,  to  berecovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.
 CA, IL, MD, MO, NJ,NY, PA, TN, VA
Revenue stability
mechanisms
 
Separates  a  utility’s  cost  recovery  from  the  amount  of  water  it  sells  to  recover  its  fixed  costs  and  ongoing  infrastructureinvestment
 needs. Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover itscosts,
 regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providingan incentive for customers to use water more efficiently.
 CA, IL, NYConsolidated tariffs
 
Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physicallyinterconnected.
 The  consolidated  tariff  pricing  structure  may  be  used  fully  or  partially  in  a  state,  and  is  generally  used  toprioritize capital investments and moderate the i
mpact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costsfor customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements.
 CA, IA, IL, IN, KY,MD, MO, NJ, NY, PA,
VA, WV
The
 Company pursues enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments in order to continue toprovide
 safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the PUCswill
 accept the Company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associatedwith traditional rat
e making processes. It is also the Company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply.Acquisitions and Strategic Growth
The
 U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governmentsor
 governmental subdivisions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as of 2017, approximately 84%  of the water market is served bymunicipal
 systems and approximately 98%  of  the  country’s  wastewater  systems  are  government  owned.  The  EPA  also  estimates  that  there  are  approximately50,000
 community water systems and approximately 15,000  community wastewater syste ms in the United States, with approximately 80% of the community watersystems serving a population of 
3,000  or less. A
 fundamental aspect of the Company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water and/or wastewater systems in geographicproximity to areas where 
the Company operates its Regulated Businesses . The proximity of acquisit ion opportunities to the Company’s regulated footprint allows itto
 integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using its existing management, although the Company typically retains the majority, if notall,
 of the employees, and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Company’s current customer mix of 93%  water and 7% wastewater
 also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation, allowing it to add wastewater customers where the Companyalready
 serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems inits existing
 markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its Regulated Businesses
.  Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity toachieve
 an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to its customers, aswell as a line of sight to grow th
e Company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.Increasingly
 stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment,financial challenges and in
dustry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.7

Table of ContentsIndustry Legislation
In
 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey,including
 municipal and investor-owned utilities  with more than 500 service  connections.  This law imposes requirements  in areas such as cybersecurity,  assetmanagement, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydra
nt and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most senior water manager,or
 either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems, to certify thatthe
 system meets the requirements under the WQAA. In 2019, the New Jersey Senate held three hearings on the WQAA and is expected to introduce legislation inthe new 2020 legislative session 
that would strengthen accountability for obligations under the WQAA.In
 2018, similar legislation was passed in Indiana that set new operational requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants as part of the permittingprocess
 for construction, installation, or modification of sources, facilities, equipment or devices. These requirements include capital asset management plans thatinclude
 annual reviews of infrastructure needs, engineering analysis of useful life, and a rate analysis to support the capital asset management plan. A life cyclecost-benefit
 analysis must be done comparing owning and operating a plant to other alternatives to supply water or wastewater services. Cybersecurity plans mustalso
 be developed. In 2019, additional legislation was passed which set requirements for access to loans or grants such as participation in regional planning events,use
 of current capital asset management programs, and elimination of the causes of non-revenue water. The finance authority was also required to establish projectprioritization that included consideration of project effects on public health and safety, user rates and charges, plan
s for collaboration, plans to manage non-revenuewater and use of best pract
ices.Also,
 in 2018, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 was signed into law. The legislation includes policies intended to improve water and wastewatersystem
 management and authorization for states to assess consolidation options for systems that do not comply with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and itsrules
 and  regulations.  The  legislation  increases  funding  to  water  system  funding  programs,  including  the  State  Revolving  Loan  Fund  program  and  the  WaterInfrastructure Financ
e and Innovation Act of 2014 (“WIFIA”).The
 Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have access to fair marketvalue
 legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities, includingstate
 legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchasedproperty. Fair market
 value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, providingmunicipalities with a
 purchase price that is reflective of the assets’ market value, while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over thelife of the assets, subje
ct to state regulatory commission approval.Consolidated
 tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.Consolidated
 tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state.As
 a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest ofsystems
 and  prioritize  capital  needs  across  the  state.  Overall,  this  brings  cost-effective,  higher  quality  services  to  a  larger  number  of  citizens.  Twelve  of  theCompany’s
 regulated  jurisdictions  currently  have  some  form  of  consolidated  tariff  pricing,  including  California,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Kentucky,  Maryland,Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia 
and West Virginia.In
 2018,  legislation  was  enacted  in  the  Company’s  Missouri  and  California  subsidiaries  changing  the  public  vote  requirement  for  the  sale  of  water  orwastewater
 systems. In Missouri, the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than500
 small  towns.  Historically,  only  larger  communities  required  a  simple  majority,  while  smaller  communities  needed  a  two-thirds  majority.  This  legislationincreases the options for small towns, should they decide
 to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale. In California, the vote required to allowcities to sell sewer syst
ems changed to a simple majority from a two-thirds majority.Competition
The Company’s 
Regulated Businesses  generally  do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those marketspursuant
 to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs or otherauthorities,
 and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However,the Company’s 
Regulated Businesses  do  face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability toprovide
 their  own  water  supply/treatment  process  and  strategic  buyers  that  are  entering  new  markets  and/or  making  strategic  acquisitions.  When  pursuingacquisitions,
 the Company’s largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are Essential Utilities, Inc.(formerly
 known as Aqua America, Inc.), Suez North America, American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, theCompany
 also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energyand Corix.

Table of ContentsCondemnation and Eminent Domain
All
 or portions of the Regulated  Businesses’  utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of thefollowing
 methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision whenthe
 original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or fromwhich
 it  received  its  CPCN.  The  acquisition  consideration  related  to  such  a  proceeding  initiated  by  a  local  government  may  be  determined  consistent  withapplicable eminent do
main law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.As such, the 
Regulated Businesses  are  periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group inMonterey,
 California  successfully  added  “Measure  J”  to  the  November  2018  election  ballot  asking  voters  to  decide  whether  the  Monterey  Peninsula  WaterManagement
 District  (the  “MPWMD”)  should  conduct  a  feasibility  study  concerning  the  potential  purchase  of  the  Monterey  water  service  system  assets  (the“Monterey
 system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote.This service territo
ry represents approximately 40,000 customers. In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. On
 August 19, 2019, the MPWMD’s General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board (1) develop criteria to determine whichwater
 systems should be considered for acquisition, (2) examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smallersystems
 only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system, (3) evaluate whether it is in the public interest to acquire the Monterey system assets andsufficiently
 satisfy the criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J, (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence anacquisition, and (5) develop 
more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.On
 November 6, 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Montereysystem
 assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions inrevenue
 requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible.The
 MPWMD will hold public hearings regarding the findings contained in this preliminary report. If the MPWMD were to make a final determination that anacquisition
 of  the  Monterey  system  assets  is  feasible,  then  the  MPWMD  would  commence  a  multi-year  eminent  domain  proceeding  against  the  Company’sCalifornia
 subsidiary to first establish the MPWMD’s right to take the Monterey system assets and, if such right is established, to determine the amount of justcompensation to be paid to th
e California subsidiary for such assets.Also, five
 municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuitagainst
 the Company’s Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminentdomain
 lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. A jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline. The parties havefiled
 with the court updated valuation reports. Although the date of the valuation trial has not currently been scheduled, it is not likely to commence before thesecond quarter of 2020.
Furthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  the Regulated  Businesses operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  propertyowners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utilit
y, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damageto that
 property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connectionwith
 large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted indamage
 to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in othercases such recovery in rates has been
 disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utilitywould be at risk for any losses not ul
timately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.Water Supply and Wastewater Services
The
 Company’s Regulated  Businesses generally  own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat,transport
 and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts,permits
 and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company isdependent
 on  defined  sources  of  water  supply  and  obtains  its  water  supply  from  surface  water  sources  such  as  reservoirs,  lakes,  rivers  and  streams;  fromgroundwater
 sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies variessignificantly
 depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment,while groundwater sources often 
require chemical treatment only.9

 Company’s  ability  to  meet  the  existing  and  future  water  demands  of  its  customers  depends  on  an  adequate  water  supply.  Drought,  governmentalrestrictions,
 overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground andsurface
 water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term.The geographic diversity of the Company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water suppl
y associated with weather extremes it mightencounter
 in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce theamount of source water ava
ilable, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.10

Table of ContentsThe
 Company  evaluates  quality,  quantity,  growth  needs  and  alternate  sources  of  water  supply  as  well  as  transmission  and  distribution  capacity.  Watersupply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have
 a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply, it useslong-term
 planning  processes  and  maintains  contingency  plans  to  minimize  the  potential  impact  on  service  caused  by  climate  variability  and  a  wide  range  ofweather
 fluctuations. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields underdifferent
 rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, bepredicted
 and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of the Company’s use of long-term planning to ensure thatit
 has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water SupplyProject
 includes the construction of a desalination plant, owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water tothe
 desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project(the
 “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The WaterSupply
 Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River asrequired under
 orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings —Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carme
l River Diversions.Wastewater
 services  involve  the  collection  of  wastewater  from  customers’  premises  through  sewer  lines.  The  wastewater  is  then  transported  through  asewer
 network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solidwaste by-product of the tre
atment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.Seasonality
Customer
 demand  for  the  Company’s  water  service  is  affected  by  weather  and  tends  to  vary  with  temperature  and  amount  and  frequency  of  rainfall.Customer
 demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. Assuch,
 the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than averagegenerally
 increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and canreduce
 water  operating  revenues.  Three  of  the  Company’s  jurisdictions,  California,  Illinois  and  New  York,  have  adopted  revenue  stability  mechanisms  whichpermit
 the Company to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lesseningthe impact of weather v
ariability. See “Regulation and Rate Making ” for additional infor mation regarding revenue stability mechanisms.Market-Based Businesses
The Company’s 
Market-Based Businesses  provide  complementary home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers and water andwastewater
 services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, utilities and industrial customers. These businesses are not subjectto regulation
 by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for the Company’s Market-Based Businesses
 were $539 million  for 2019, $476 million for 2018 and $422 million  for 2017, accounting for 15% , 14% and 13% , respectively, of the Company’s totaloperating revenues for th
e same periods.The Company’s primary 
Market-Based Businesses  include the following opera ting segments:•
Homeowner Services Group  (“HOS”), which provides various warranty p rotection programs and other home services to residential customers;•
Military  Services Group (“MSG”),  which enters  into long-term  contracts  with the U.S. government  to provide  water  and wastewater  services  onvarious military installations.
The
 Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related servicesthrough its 
Contract Services Group  (“ CSG”). Previously,
 the Company provided customized water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies through its KeystoneClearwater Solutions, LLC (“Keystone”
) operations. On December 12, 2019 , as  part of a strategic review undertaken by the Company, the Company sold all of itsinterest
 in  Keystone  to  a  natural  gas  and  oil  industry  investment  group.  See Note  4—Acquisitions  and  Divestitures in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  FinancialStatements for addition
al information.11

Table of ContentsHomeowner Services Group
The
 Company’s Homeowner  Services  Group,  which  includes  the  operations  of  Pivotal  Home  Solutions  (“Pivotal”)  acquired  in  June  2018,  provideswarranty
 protection  programs  and  other  home  services  to  residential  customers  for  interior  and  exterior  water  and  sewer  lines,  interior  gas  and  electric  lines,heating
 and  cooling  systems,  water  heaters  and  other  home  appliances,  as  well  as  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  The  Company  developspartnerships
 with municipalities, utilities and other organizations to offer protection programs to customers serviced by, or affiliated with, those municipalities,utilities
 and organizations. The term of these partnership agreements with the municipalities, utilities and other organizations is typically three to five years, withmutual optional renewals. As of 
December 31, 2019 , HOS had approximately 3 million  customer contracts in 43  states.Military Services Group
The
 Company’s Military  Services  Group operates  on 16  military  installations  under  50-year  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  as  part  of  its  UtilityPrivatization
 Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and acapital
 program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to theCompany
 is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization programperformed
 over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support theinstallation’s
 mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capitalprogram historically has not used the Company’s equity or debt borr
owings; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under thesecontracts. In
 April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects. However, the U.S.Army’s
 implementation of this requirement has limited the need for financing of these projects and the Company has been awarded several projects without anyrequirement to provide 
financing.The contract price for
 nine of the Company’s contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations,and
 every  three  years  thereafter.  Price  redetermination  is  a  contract  mechanism  to  periodically  adjust  the  service  fee  in  the  next  period,  to  reflect  changes  incontract
 obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining seven  contracts  with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under amechanism similar to price redetermination
 called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All of these contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end ofthe
 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In either event,pursuant
 to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts, the Company would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred underthe
 contract,  plus  the  contract  profit  margin  on  incurred  costs.  The  Company’s  backlog  of  revenue  associated  with  its  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  isapproximately 
$5.4 billion , with an average remain ing contract term of 42  years.Competition
The
 Company’s Market-Based Businesses  face  competition from a number of service providers, including HomeServe USA and Cinch Home Services inHOS
, and American States Wat er Company, Suez North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A. in MSG . Environmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regula
tionThe
 Company’s  water  and  wastewater  operations,  including  the  services  provided  by  both  its Regulated  Businesses and Market-Based  Businesses,  aresubject
 to  extensive  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  governing  the  protection  of  the  environment,  health  and  safety,  the  provision  of  water  andwastewater
 services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges,recycles
 and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reductionof
 Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state tostate
 in  those  instances  where  a  state  has  adopted  a  standard  that  is  more  stringent  than  the  Federal  standard.  For  example,  while  the  EPA  has  issued  a  non-enforceable Health
 Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS),the
 New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is developing drinking water standards for these two compounds and has adopted a standard for a thirdcompound,
 perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, as well as other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The Company is also subject to variousfederal,
 state, local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges toair
 and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also setconditions and standards for th
e water and wastewater services the Company delivers.12

Table of ContentsThe
 Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, andeffective
 use of natural resources, which is important given the overall trend that drinking water standards have become increasingly more stringent over time. Asnewer
 or  stricter  standards  are  introduced,  the  Company’s  capital  and  operating  costs  could  increase.  The  Company  incurs  substantial  costs  associated  withcompliance
 with the environmental,  health  and safety,  and water  quality  standards  to which its operations  are  subject and the Company invests  in technologysolutions
 for enhanced detection and monitoring. The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $600 million  over  the next fiveyears for environmenta
l control facilities, which the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, wateror
 land.  The  Company  believes  that  its  operations  are  materially  in  compliance  with,  and  in  many  cases  surpass,  minimum  standards  required  by  applicableenvironmental laws and regu
lations.The
 Company’s  operations  also  involve  the  use,  storage  and  disposal  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  For  example,  the  Company’s  water  andwastewater
 treatment  facilities  store  and  use  chlorine  and  other  chemicals  that  generate  wastes  that  require  proper  handling  and  disposal  under  applicableenvironmental
 requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-site disposal of wastes. The Compreh
ensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparablestate
 laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedialactions at
 any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one ormore
 hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of suchsites,
 may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup ordecontamination
 obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs. The Company’sfacilities
 and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder. Certain of the Company’ssubsidiaries are involved 
in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings  for additional information. Safe Drinking Water Act
The
 Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levelsof numerous, naturally occu
rring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose newrules.
 These  rules  also  prescribe  testing  requirements  for  detecting  regulated  contaminants,  the  treatment  systems  that  may  be  used  for  removing  thosecontaminants,
 and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for approximately 90  contaminants and indicators for drinking water, and there is aprocess in place to make 
a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.To
 help  formulate  the  basis  for  future  regulations,  the  EPA  has  the  authority  to  require  monitoring  for  additional,  unregulated  contaminants  under  theUnregulated
 Contaminant Monitoring Rule (the “Monitoring Rule”). The Company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the MonitoringRule
 in previous rounds, which occurs every five years, and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round, which is scheduled for completion by the end of2020.
 There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which are lacking a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effectsinformation and/or treatment technology. The process of developin
g new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates withthe
 EPA  and  other  water  industry  groups  by  sharing  research  and  water  quality  operational  knowledge.  See  “Research  and  Development—EmergingContainments” for addition
al information.To
 effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinkingwater and
 to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process. In 2006, the EPA issued the Long-Term 2 Enhanced SurfaceWater
 Treatment  Rule  and  the  Stage  2  Disinfectants  and  Disinfection  Byproduct  Rule  and  finalized  the  Ground  Water  Rule,  which  is  applicable  to  systemsproviding water from underground source
s. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levelsrequires
 an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with these standards, which includes samplecollection,
 data analysis, engineering planning and system implementation. Recent monitoring under the Long-Term 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than30
 of the Company’s surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium. In many cases, this will involve installing UV disinfection,and
 although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades, an estimated $150 million  to $250 million of  investment will still be required forthe
 remaining facilities. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent chromium, fluoride,nitrosamines,
 perchlorate, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted,will require implem
entation in 2020.13

Table of ContentsThe
 Company  conducts  over  one  million  water  quality  tests  each  year  at  its  laboratory  facilities  and  plant  operations,  including  continuous  onlineinstrumentations
 such  as  monitoring  turbidity  levels,  disinfectant  residuals  and  adjustments  to  chemical  treatment  based  on  changes  in  incoming  water.  TheCompany
 participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 69 of the Company’s 
80  surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed acomprehensive
 self-assessment  report,  (ii)  created  an  action  plan  for  continuous  improvement,  and  (iii)  produced  high-quality  drinking  water,  the  Companyaccounts
 for  approximately  one-third  of  the  plants  receiving  such  awards  nationwide.  In  addition, 67  of  the  Company’s  surface  water  treatment  plants  havereceived
 the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62  plants have received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 58  plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award,and 
three plants  have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III” award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20years,
 respectively. Further, nine  of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve thePartnership’s rigorous individu
al filter effluent turbidity standards.Although
 it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects currentrequirements
 under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are notexpected
 to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmentalmandates
 have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operatingand capital costs resul
ting from these pending or future requirements.Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act
In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and
 Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisionsin
 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking WaterAct
 regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact inreducing lead
 exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certainwater
 systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to anumber
 of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing watermain
 replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace LSLs in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Companyutilizes
 appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. The EPA proposed revisions to theLCR
 in November 2019 designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. The Companycontinues to review the implications of the LCR an
d comments on the proposed revisions to the rule were due to the EPA by February 12, 2020. The Company willdevelop
 an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements, if and when adopted, prior to the compliance effective dates in the final rule. Capitalexpenditures
 and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions cannot be determined until the final rule is promulgated, but costsassociated with complian
ce with federal regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.The
 Company currently estimates that approximately 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company orcustomer
 portion of the service line (“LSLs”). The Company is replacing LSLs as part of ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects. TheCompany’s
 goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most service areas by the end of2030,
 at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million  to $1.2 billion.  The Company believes this will be attainable for most service areas where public policy issupportive
 of this goal. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removalgoals
 appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal plan is dependent on several factors, including the Company’s planned water main andservice
 line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers withrespect
 to  replacing  the  customer-owned  portion  of  the  LSL  as  necessary.  In  certain  cases  these  factors  may  result  in  a  shorter  or  longer  time  frame  forreplacement.
 Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking WaterAdvisory Council, the
 Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to replacethe
 entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is adiverse
 group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encouragecommunities to accelerate the full re
placement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level.14

Table of ContentsClean Water Act
The Clean Water Act regul
ates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition torequirements
 applicable  to  the  Company’s  wastewater  collection  systems,  its  operations  require  discharge  permits  under  the  National  Pollutant  DischargeElimination
 System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permitprogram,
 the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Dischargesthat
 exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significantfines
 and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, mayimpose
 time and cost burdens on the Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s facilities, some of which result infines. The Company does not expect any su
ch violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance
The
 Company considers environmental, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) to include: environmental leadership and sustainability; operationalexcellence;
 employee engagement, safety and equality; active community engagement, civic and charitable involvement; and transparency and good governance.Integration
 of these principles into the Company’s daily operations emphasizes its belief that “how” a company operates is just as important as “what” a companydoes.
This
 focus is derived from the Company’s vision statement, “clean water for life,” and its core values: (i) safety; (ii) trust; (iii) environmental leadership;(iv)
 teamwork; and (v) high performance, which are the principles by which it operates. The Company’s vision and values drive its company strategy, which iscentered on five central themes:

Research and Development
The Company’s Research and Development Program
The Company maintains an
 industry-leading Research and Development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, help ensure compliance,improve
 quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its inception, American Water’s R&Dprogram
 has  evolved  into  an  industry  leading  effort  and  has  achieved  numerous  advancements  in the  science  of  drinking  water,  wastewater,  and  desalination.Through
 laboratory and industry resources and the team’s expertise, efforts are focused on contaminants of emerging concern, including but not limited to PFAS,Legionella,
 cyanotoxin-forming  algal blooms, pathogens and disinfection byproducts. The Company’s R&D personnel are located at the Company’s corporateheadquarters
 and at two laboratory testing facilities in New Jersey and Illinois, the latter housing its quality control and testing laboratory, which supports theCompany’s R&D activities through t
esting and analysis.The
 Company  continues  to  leverage  its  expertise  and collaborate  with  the  EPA and  state  agencies  to  help  establish  effective  environmental,  health  andsafety,
 and water quality standards and regulation. This relationship includes the sharing of the Company’s research, such as its treatment and distribution systemoptimization
 research  and  its  national  water  quality  monitoring  data.  The  Company’s  engagement  with  the  EPA  provides  it  with  early  insight  into  emergingregulatory
 issues  and  initiatives,  thereby  allowing  the  Company  to  anticipate  and  to  accommodate  its  future  compliance  requirements.  The  Company  alsofrequently
 engages  with  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control,  other  state  environmental  agencies,  and  national  and  international  water  research  foundations.  TheCompany believes that continu
ed R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in theindustry, which provides the Company with a 
competitive advantage as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers.Emerging Contaminants
Emerging
 contaminants  include  numerous  chemicals  such  as  pharmaceuticals,  personal  care  products,  pesticides,  herbicides  and  endocrine  disruptingcompounds,
 as well as some naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for whichthe
 risk to the public’s health is not fully understood and/or has not been quantified. While these contaminants have been present in drinking water for as long asthey
 have been in use, technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels,has raised questions among regu
lators and government agencies, further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality.The
 Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 159 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes thatcan
 affect  humans.  The  Company  is  continually  investigating  new  substances  and  contaminants,  employing  a  team  of  scientists,  engineers  and  public  healthprofessionals
 to  identify  threats  to  its  water  supply,  to  act  on  emerging  regulations  and  new  health  advisories,  and  to  evaluate  the  benefits  of  alternative  oradvanced
 treatment technologies. The Company maintains state-of-the-art water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to helppredict and manage poten
tial water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Company’s efforts include:•
using  its research findings to communicate information to its customers on the actions they can take to manage Legionella (the Centers for DiseaseControl
 statistics  indicate  that  water-associated  disease  from  Legionella  is  on  the  rise,  with  exposure  typically  associated  with  customer-ownedplumbing systems in large bui
ldings);•
aerial  drone  testing  to  detect  harmful  algal  blooms  and  testing  ultrasonic  technology  to  help  prevent  taste  and  odor  events  and  to  eliminatecyanotoxins before they get 
to the water treatment plant;•
the  implementation of water  source assessment tools, including sensors and analytics, to  evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the detectionof source water contamin
ation events;•
development of methodol ogy and measurement techniques for emerging contaminants to investigate transport, occurrence and treatment; and•
the implementation o f activated carbon, biofiltration and ion exchange for the control of emerging contaminants.17

We
 operate  in  a  market  and  regulatory  environment  that  involves  significant  risks,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control.  In  addition  to  the  otherinformation
 included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects.Any
 of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flowsand liquidity.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations
Our
 utility  operations  are  subject  to  extensive  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  other  regulatory  agencies,  which  significantly  affects  our  business,  financialcondition,
 results of operations and cash flows. Our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet theseregulatory requirements.
Our 
Regulated Businesses provide  water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. Thisregulation
 affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations. Generally, the state PUCs authorize usto
 charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operating and maintenancecosts, depreciation, fin
ancing costs and taxes, and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.Our
 ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rateincrease
 applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, ormay be partially approv
ed, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:•
cover our expenses, including pur chased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;•
enable us to recover our inv estment; and•
provide us with an opportunity to ea rn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.Approval
 of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financialpenalties,
 fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvalsand
 certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions, dispositions, and, in certain cases, affiliated transactions. Although webelieve
 that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we areunable to predict the i
mpact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.In any of these
 cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if rates are sufficient,we
 face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditionsexist,
 including, but not limited to, if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher thanthe level estimat
ed in establishing rates.20


Table of ContentsOur
 operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety lawsand regulations, including with
 respect to emerging contaminants, compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures, andviolations of which could subject us to substantial liab
ilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.Our regulated
 water and wastewater operations and the operations of our Market-Based Businesses  are  subject to extensive federal, state and local laws andregulations.
 These requirements include, among others, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the LCR and CERCLA. EPA requirements and similarfederal
 and state laws and regulations. For example, state PUCs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater serviceswe
 deliver. If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws,regulations
 or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well asdamage
 to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operatingassets
 to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature of our business which, in part, involves supplying water for human consumption, any potential non-compliance
 with, or violation of, environmental, water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to acompany not similarly invo
lved in the water and wastewater industry.In
 addition,  CERCLA authorizes  the EPA to issue orders  and bring enforcement  actions  to compel responsible  parties  to investigate  and take remedialactions
 with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsibleparties for the costs th
ereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.We
 incur  substantial  operating  and  capital  costs  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  comply  with  environmental,  water  quality  and  health  and  safety  laws  andregulations.
 These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, generally have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increaseour
 costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that thevarious
 state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses  would  approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs orthat such costs will not mat
erially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 may  also  incur  liabilities  if,  under  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  we  are  required  to  investigate  and  clean  up  environmental  contamination,including
 potential releases of hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of waste orcaused
 an adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result insignificant
 costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered byinsurance and may make it
 difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.Attention
 is being given to emerging contaminants, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatorystandard
 in  drinking  water  or  have  been  recently  created  or  discovered  (including  by  means  of  scientific  achievements  in  the  analysis  and  detection  of  traceamounts
 of  substances).  Examples  of  sources  of  emerging  contaminants  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  newly  created  chemical  compounds  (including,  forexample,
 manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds; bacteria, microbes, viruses, amoebae andother
 pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public fromthese
 and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, inwhole
 or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapidpace
 at which emerging contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking watersystem
 or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In addition, we believe emergingcontaminants may
 form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increasethe cost of our operations.

Table of ContentsLimitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of
 water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect ouraccess to sources of water, our ability to suppl
y water to customers or the demand for our water services.Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depen
ds on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources ofpublic
 water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. As a result, wetypically
 do  not  own  the  water  that  we  use  in  our  operations,  and  the  availability  of  our  water  supply  is  established  through  allocation  rights  (determined  bylegislation
 or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities. Passing-flow requirements set minimum volumes of water that mustpass through specified
 water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users.Allocation rights are
 imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing-flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smallerrivers,
 lakes and streams. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supplyissues,
 such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability ofground and surface water.
For example, in
 our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October20,
 2009 cease and desist order (the “2009 Order”), as amended by an order in July 2016 (the “2016 Order”), of the SWRCB that requires California-AmericanWater
 Company, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Cal Am”), to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedulethat
 terminates on December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Deadline”). We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with therequirements
 of the Endangered Species Act. We cannot predict whether Cal Am will be able to secure alternative sources of water, or if Cal Am will be exposedto
 liabilities, including fines and penalties, if it is unable to meet the 2021 Deadline under the 2016 Order. Furthermore, Cal Am continues to work constructivelywith
 all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information to obtain the required approvals for the Water Supply Project; however, due to the delay in theapproval
 schedule,  Cal  Am  currently  does  not  believe  that  it  will  be  able  to  fully  comply  with  the  diversion  reduction  requirements  and  other  remainingrequirements under
 the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, including the 2021 Deadline. If Cal Am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternativesource
 of water, or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flowscould
 be  adversely  affected.  See Item  3—Legal  Proceedings—Alternative  Water  Supply  in  Lieu  of  Carmel  River  Diversions,  which  includes  additionalinformation regarding 
this matter.Climate
 variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of whichmay not be fully recoverable 
in rates or otherwise.The
 issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weathervolatility in the
 future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewaterutilities, including us, such 
as:•
increased frequency and du ration of droughts;•
increased precipit ation and flooding;•
increased frequency and s everity of storms and other weather events;•
challenges associated wit h changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;•
potential degradation o f water quality;•
decreases in availab le water supply and changes in water usage patterns;•
increases in disruptions in s ervice;•
increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or•
increased  costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of ourwater production and delive
ry facilities and systems.Because
 of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition,results
 of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our Regulated Businesses could be recoveredthrough
 rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases toenable us to recover such exp
enditures and costs, in whole or in part.22

Table of ContentsThe
 current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructureimprovements,
 incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate caseapplications; our inability to mini
mize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.There
 is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operatingexpense
 increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based onthe
 volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by decliningusage
 and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effecton our financial condition, 
results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 endeavor  to  reduce  regulatory  lag  by  pursuing  constructive  regulatory  policies.  For  example,  three  of  our  states  have  approved  revenue  stabilitymechanisms
 that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition ofdeclining
 sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 11 of our state PUCspermit
 rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement ofaging
 infrastructure.  These  surcharges  are  adjusted  periodically  based  on  factors  such  as  project  completion  or  future  budgeted  expenditures,  and  specificsurcharges are
 eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, ten of our state PUCs allowus
 to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflectedin rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such programs include states that allo
w us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control,such
 as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. These surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjustrates in less time a
fter costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process.While
 these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag inthose
 jurisdictions that have not approved such programs. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continuein
 their current form, or at all. Although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state PUC approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag, ourefforts
 may not be successful, or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag, in which case our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, cash flo
ws and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.Changes in laws
 and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flowsand liquidity.
New
 legislation, regulations, government policies or court decisions, including, without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other taxlaws,
 can  materially  affect  our  operations,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  The  individuals  who  serve  as  regulators  are  elected  or  political  appointees.Therefore,
 elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulatorsand
 the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy,including
 those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences,among others:
•
making it more diffi cult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;•
changing the determina tion of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases;•
restricting  our  ability  to  terminate  our  services  to  customers  who  owe  us  money  for  services  previously  provided  or  limiting  our  bill  collectionefforts;
•
requiring us to provide water o r wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;•
limiting  or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets or issue securities, or making it less cost-effective for us to do so;
•
negatively  impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may beavailable, the amount o
f taxes owed, the timing of tax effects on rates, or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;•
changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;•
increasing  the associated costs of, or difficulty complying with, environmental, health, safety, consumer privacy, water quality, and water qualityaccountability laws and r
egulations to which our operations are subject;23

Table of Contents•
changing or placing addition al limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;•
making  it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, orfor governmental agenc
ies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;•
placing  limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between aregulated subsidiary and us or ou
r other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;•
restricting or prohibiting  our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and•
revoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC.Any of the foregoing consequences cou
ld have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.In
 addition, new Federal, state and local laws, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof, could impact us. InDecember
 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, asamended
 (the “Code”), including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain otherprovisions
 related specifically to the public utility industry, including the normalization of our deferred income taxes. The enactment of the TCJA required re-measurement
 of our deferred income taxes, which materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position and had a lesser impact on our 2018results
 of operations and financial position. Following enactment of the TCJA, the Company adjusted its customer rates and deferred income taxes to reflect thelower
 income  tax  rate  as  mandated  by  PUCs  in  jurisdictions  that  have  addressed  the  issue.  We  expect  that  further  impacts  to  our  deferred  income  taxes  willcontinue
 to occur through pending or future rate cases or other proceedings in the remaining jurisdictions. At this time, we cannot predict the impacts on us of theregulatory treatment of the
 TCJA in these remaining proceedings, or of the enactment or adoption of any Related Interpretations, if and when issued. Moreover, weare
 unable  to  determine  or  predict  the  potential  impacts,  if  any,  of  any  other  new  or  amended  laws,  rules  or  regulations,  or  interpretations  thereof,  including,without limitation, fur
ther amendments to the Code or applicable Treasury regulations, to the extent they may be ultimately enacted, adopted or issued, on us or ourbusinesses, financial condi
tion, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand forour water services, which could adversely aff
ect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 interruptions  due  to  severe  weather,  climate  variability  patterns  and  other  natural  events  are  possible  across  all  our  businesses.  These  include,among
 other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastalfloods
 or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, severe electrical storms, sinkholes and solar flares. Weather and other naturalevents
 such  as  these  may  affect  the  condition  or  operability  of  our  facilities,  limiting  or  preventing  us  from  delivering  water  or  wastewater  services  to  ourcustomers,
 or  requiring  us  to  make  substantial  capital  expenditures  to  repair  any  damage.  Tariffs  in  place  or  cost  recovery  proceedings  with  respect  to  ourRegulated Businesses may not provide 
reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.Government
 restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers,which
 may  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Seasonal  drought  conditions  that  may  impact  our  water  services  arepossible
 across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of thesupply
 adequacy of any individual system. Responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions, rationing restrictions, water conservationregulations,
 and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally berecoverable
 provided  the relevant  PUC determines  they were  reasonable  and  prudent,  we  cannot  assure  that  any  such expenses  incurred  will,  in fact,  be fullyrecovered.
 Moreover, reductions in water consumption, including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist evenafter
 drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.

Table of ContentsA
 loss  of  one  or  more  large  industrial  customers  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  upon  the  results  of  operations  of  one  or  more  of  our  RegulatedBusinesses.
Adverse
 economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers, particularly industrial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of operationsby
 an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent.Any decrease
 in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and resultsof operations. Tariffs in p
lace with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.Our 
Regulated  Businesses require  significant  capital  expenditures  and  may  suffer  if  we  fail  to  secure  appropriate  funding  to  make  investments,  or  if  weexperience delays in comple
ting major capital expenditure projects.The
 water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. We invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant andequipment,
 and to improve aging infrastructure. In 2019 ,  we invested $1.7 billion  in  net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expendituresnecessary
 to maintain the integrity  of our systems will continue into the future and may increase. We expect to fund capital improvement projects  using cashgenerated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit
 facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt and equity. We may notbe
 able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capitalimprovements
 on  favorable  terms  or  at  all.  If  we  are  not  able  to  obtain  sufficient  financing,  we  may  be  unable  to  maintain  our  existing  property,  plant  andequipment,
 fund  our  capital  investment  strategies,  meet  our  growth  targets  and  expand  our  rate  base  to  enable  us  to  earn  satisfactory  future  returns  on  ourinvestments.
 Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capitalprojects
 on time, as a result of construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, or other obstacles. Each ofthese outcomes could advers
ely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Aging infrastructure may lead to service d
isruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, all of which could negatively impactour financial results.
We
 have  risks  associated  with  aging  infrastructure,  including  water  and  sewer  mains,  pumping  stations  and  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.Additionally,
 the nature of information available on buried and newly acquired assets may be limited, which may challenge our ability to conduct efficient assetmanagement
 and  maintenance  practices.  Assets  that  have  aged  beyond  their  expected  useful  lives  may  experience  a  higher  rate  of  failure.  Failure  of  aginginfrastructure
 could result in increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, and negatively impact our future O&M efficiency ratio. In addition, failure of aginginfrastructure may
 result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are notfully recovered in ra
tes, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.Seasonality could adversely affe
ct the volume of water sold and our revenues.The
 volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increasedwater usage for irriga
tion systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months,the
 volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer monthsare cooler than norma
l, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.Three
 of our jurisdictions, California, Illinois, and New York, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state PUC-authorizedrevenue for a
 given period, which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recoverthe fixed cost
 of operations while supporting water conservation goals. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, operating resultscould continue to be affe
cted by seasonality.Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the co
llection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs.The
 wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. Ifcollection,
 treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby propertiesor
 into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods ofsubstantial
 rainfall  or  flooding,  which  are  the  main  causes  of  sewer  overflow  and  system  failure.  Liabilities  resulting  from  such  damage  could  adversely  andmaterially aff
ect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.25

Table of ContentsContamination
 of  water  supplies  or  our  water  service  provided  to  our  customers  could  result  in  service  limitations  and  interruptions  and  exposure  tosubstances
 not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations,government enforcement actions, damage 
to our reputation and private litigation.The
 water  supplies  that  flow  into  our  treatment  plants  or  are  delivered  through  our  distribution  system,  or  the  water  service  that  is  provided  to  ourcustomers, may be subject 
to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems,pollution
 resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, lead and other materials, chemical spills or other accidents that resultin
 contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks. In addition, new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry.If
 one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to takeresponsive
 actions  that  could  include,  among  other  things  (1)  continuing  limited  use  of  the  water  supply  under  a  “Do  Not  Use”  protective  order  that  enablescontinuation
 of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply. If service is disrupted, our financial condition, resultsof
 operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated sourcethrough
 the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We may be unable to recovercosts
 associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms. Any recovery of these costs that weare
 able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arisingfrom
 government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in ourdrinking water and water suppli
es.Since
 we  engage  in  the  business  of  providing  water  service  to  our  customers,  contamination  of  the  water  supply,  or  the  water  service  provided  to  ourcustomers,
 could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Suchclaims
 could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may bebrought by
 our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur, andwe
 may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputationmay
 occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination orhazardous
 substances in the water or water supplies. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductiblesand
 other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
We may sustain losses that exceed or are ex
cluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.We
 maintain  insurance  coverage  as  part  of  our  overall  legal  and  risk  management  strategy  to  minimize  potential  liabilities  arising  from  our  utilityoperations,
 as  well  as  the  operations  of  our Market-Based  Businesses.  Our  insurance  programs  have  varying  coverage  limits,  exclusions  and  maximums,  andinsurance
 companies  may  seek  to  deny  claims  we  might  make.  Generally,  our  insurance  policies  cover  property  damage,  worker’s  compensation,  employer’sliability,
 general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits forcovered claims. As a resul
t, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.Although
 in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure allnecessary
 or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreasedcoverage limits, more limited co
verage, increased premium costs or deductibles.We
 are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatoryoversight or sanctions.
Our
 business and operations have a large direct  and indirect customer  base and, as a result, we are exposed to public criticism  regarding,  among otherthings,
 the reliability of their water, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format ofbills
 that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state PUCs andother
 regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative,regulatory
 and  economic  outcomes,  as  well  as  increased  regulatory  or  other  oversight  and  more  stringent  regulatory  or  economic  requirements.  Unfavorableregulatory
 and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic termsin
 our agreements related to our Market-Based Businesses ,  as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoingcould have a materia
l negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.26

Table of ContentsFor
 example, New York American Water Company, Inc. (“NYAW”) has been the subject of a New York State Public Service Commission (“NYSPSC”)investigation
 related to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an over-assessment of real property taxes. NYAW self-reported
 this issue to the NYSPSC promptly after NYAW’s senior leadership became aware of it. Neither NYAW nor any of its employees received any financialbenefit
 as a result of this matter, as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities. The NYSPSC investigation also related to the failureof a few employees working on NY
AW’s 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case. In September 2018, a settlement of these matterswas
 approved by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Albany County, and NYAW has been working with the New York State Department of PublicService
 to implement its terms. While the settlement resolves the NYSPSC’s investigation involving NYAW and those matters set forth above, there can be noassurance
 that NYAW will not be subject to additional federal, state or local proceedings regarding these and other related matters, and these proceedings couldresult in increased oversi
ght and civil, administrative and/or criminal sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect upon our reputation and perception.The
 failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows and liquidity.
The
 properties of our Regulated Businesses  segment  include 76  dams, the majority of which are earthen dams, and the failure of any of which could resultin
 personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would alsoadversely
 affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Any
 losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses maymake it difficult for us to
 secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.We
 also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has beenmaterial.
 The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entailmaterial
 costs. Although in most cases, the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able torecover
 costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result ofregulatory lag can af
fect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Any
 failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition andreputation.
Our
 operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the UnitedStates.
 A  failure  of  major  pipes  or  reservoirs  could  result  in  injuries,  property  and  other  damage  for  which  we  may  be  liable.  The  failure  of  major  pipes  andreservoirs
 may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit ourability
 to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators,including
 state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation.Any
 business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us tosecure
 insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not berecovered through rate 
adjustments.An
 important  part  of  our  growth  strategy  is  the  acquisition  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  involves  risks,  including  competition  for  acquisitionopportunities from other regulated utili
ties, governmental entities and other buyers, that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.An important
 element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and moveinto
 new,  service  areas.  We  may  not  be  able  to  acquire  other  systems  or  businesses  if  we  cannot  identify  suitable  acquisition  opportunities  or  reach  mutuallyagreeable
 terms  with  acquisition  candidates.  Further,  competition  for  acquisition  opportunities  from  other  regulated  utilities,  governmental  entities,  and  otherbuyers may hinder our abili
ty to expand our business.The
 negotiation  and  execution  of  potential  acquisitions  as  well  as  the  integration  of  acquired  systems  or  businesses  with  our  existing  operations  couldrequire us to incur signif
icant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:•
incurrence  or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business, including liabilitiesthat were unknown at the time o
f acquisition;•
failure to recover acquisition premiums;•
unanticipated capit al expenditures;•
failure to maintain effective internal c ontrol over financial reporting;27

Table of Contents•
the need to successfully in tegrate the acquired systems’ cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures with those of the Company’s;•
recording goodwill and other in tangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;•
fluctuations in quarte rly results;•
unanticipated acquisi tion-related expenses;•
failure to reali ze anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and•
difficulties in int egrating or assimilating personnel, benefits, services and systems.Some
 or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieveanticipated
 sales and profitability or other perceived synergies, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations,reduce our operating ma
rgins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.We
 compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. If consolidation becomesmore
 prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase andlimit our ability to 
expand through acquisitions.Our 
Regulated  Businesses are  subject  to  condemnation  and  other  proceedings  through  eminent  domain  or  other  similar  authorized  process,  which  couldmaterially and adversely af
fect their results of operations and financial condition.Municipalities
 and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States,and
 organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses  operate  to convert our assets to publicownership
 and  operation  through  exercise  of  the  governmental  power  of  eminent  domain,  or  another  similar  authorized  process.  A  municipality  or  othergovernment subdivision or a citizen group may seek to
 acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of acitizen petition.
For
 example, in November 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J was certified as having been approved by a public vote, requiring the MPWMDto
 conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system assets without an additional public vote. OnNovember
 6, 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary report finding, among other things, that the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMDwould
 be economically feasible. Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against ourIllinois subsidiary in
 January 2013, seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. This lawsuit remains pending, and a valuation trial islikely
 to be held in the near future. See Item  1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Condemnation and Eminent Domain,  which includes additional informationregarding these matters.
Furthermore,
 the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our Regulated  Businesses operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  propertyowners
 to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause ofdamage
 to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed inconnection
 with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event thatresulted in damage to th
e property. In some cases, the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits.Contesting an
 exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedingsand
 may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which mayrequire
 us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. If amunicipality
 or  other  government  subdivision  succeeds  in  acquiring  the  assets  of  one  or  more  of  our Regulated  Businesses through  eminent  domain  or  otherprocess,
 there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not beable
 to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,financial condition, c
ash flows and liquidity.We rely on operational and technology systems to
 facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of thesesystems could adversely aff
ect our business.Our
 operational and technology systems are an integral part of our business, and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability tomanage
 and  operate  our  business  efficiently,  which,  in  turn,  could  cause  our  business  and  competitive  position  to  suffer  and  adversely  affect  our  results  ofoperations. For example, we depend on
 these systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certain plant operations and constructionprojects, manage
 our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory andaccounts receivable collections.

Table of ContentsAlthough
 we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations, our technology systems remainvulnerable to damage or 
interruption from:•
power loss, computer systems fa ilures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•
operator error or imp roper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees and contractors;•
physical and electroni c loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, hacking, denial of services action, misappropriationof data or other property 
and similar events;•
computer viruses; and •
severe weather and other events, including without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.These
 events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer, employee or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation of property and otheradverse consequences. In
 addition, a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impactof
 any of these events on us. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, andwe
 might lack sufficient resources  to make the necessary upgrades or replacements  of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate  at ourcurrent
 level of efficiency. Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cashflows.
We may be subject to physical and/or c
yber attacks.As
 operators of critical  infrastructure,  we may face a heightened risk of physical and/or cyber attacks from internal or external sources. Our water andwastewater
 systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Ouroperational and technology sys
tems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of war orterrorism,
 and  other  causes.  Unauthorized  access  to  confidential  information  located  or  stored  on  these  systems  could  negatively  and  materially  impact  ourcustomers,
 employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us oradminister
 and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protectour
 operational and technology systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. Wecannot guarantee that su
ch protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.If,
 despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customerand
 other confidential information lost or stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; suffer a loss of management time,attention
 and resources from our regular business operations; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to our reputation, any of which couldhave
 a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be non-compliant withapplicable
 laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedingsand regulatory fines or pen
alties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security andinsurance related costs.
In
 addition,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  collect  and  retain  sensitive  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  about  ourcustomers
 and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss and/orfraudulent
 use  of  customer,  employee  or  proprietary  data  as  a  result  of  a  cyber  attack  could  subject  us  to  significant  litigation,  liability  and  costs,  as  well  asadversely impact our r
eputation with customers and regulators, among others.We
 have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach, but such insurance issubject
 to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. The market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new andcoverage
 available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe arereasonable, and the costs of 
responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.29

Table of ContentsOur inability
 to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected costsor otherwise adversely impact our internal 
controls environment, operations and profitability.Upgrades
 and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management’stime
 and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees’ability to effect
ively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and haveinstalled
 new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. These efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations andenhance
 our customer service capabilities. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems mayincrease
 costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control overfinancial
 reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve ourcustomers
 effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that allsuch impacts
 have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations, fin
ancial condition and cash flows.An inability to successfully deve
lop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which couldhave a material adverse eff
ect on our business and financial results.A
 significant part of our long-term strategic focus on safety, operational excellence, O&M expense efficiency, water quality, asset and capital managementand
 the customer experience includes the development and implementation of new technologies to be used for, among other things: customer service and support;environmental
 compliance;  water  metering;  water  quality  and  source  monitoring;  cybersecurity;  business  development  and  growth;  data  analysis;  employeedevelopment
 and training; and other initiatives. For example, we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing, deploying andmaintaining
 customer-facing technologies, applications to support field service and customer service operations, water source sensor and evaluation technologies,and
 data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies. Where appropriate, we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructureand systems.
There
 can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing, developing, deploying, integrating or maintaining these new technologies, and if they donot
 perform effectively or adequately serve their respective business objectives, their value to us and our business and operations may be negatively and materiallyimpacted.
 Because  these  efforts  can  be  long-term  in  nature,  these  new  technologies  may  be  more  costly  or  time-consuming  than  expected  to  design,  develop,integrate
 and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion. Technologies that do not perform as intended or desiredmay
 need to be redesigned, redeveloped or abandoned. While we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures withrespect to the costs and expenses
 of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses, there can be no assurance that we will beable
 to do so in every instance or at all. Our failure to timely and effectively invest in, develop, deploy and implement improvements to, and properly maintain theoperation
 and  integrity  of,  our  new  technologies,  including  related  data  and  other  related  systems,  and/or  adequately  obtain  recovery  in  rates  of  the  costs  andexpenses
 associated with such activities, may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended O&M expense efficiencies or other key performance results and,ultimately, could ma
terially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.All
 of the intellectual property that has been or is being used or developed in connection with these technologies, we believe we own, or have valid licensesto
 use. However, competitors, contracting parties or other third parties may bring claims against us to challenge our right to use, license, sub-license, market ormonetize,
 in whole or in part, such intellectual property or derivatives thereof or works made therefrom, and the assertion, defense or protection of our intellectualproperty
 rights could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. If we are unable to do so, or it is determined that we do not own or have validlicenses
 or other rights to any of the intellectual property used in our technologies, we may lose valuable rights to what we regard as our intellectual property, thecarrying
 values of the affected technologies may need to be decreased significantly, and we may be required to obtain or purchase licenses at significant cost fromthird
 parties to use the intellectual property. In any of these cases, we may be unable to execute our long-term strategy, and our financial condition, results ofoperations and cash flows may be 
materially and adversely impacted.Our
 business has inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life, and be exposedto financial losses, including penalties and other l
iabilities.Safety
 is a core value and a strategy at American Water. Our safety performance and continual progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries iscritical
 to our reputation. We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the public. Although we intend toadhere to such health a
nd safety standards with a goal of achieving zero injuries, it is extremely challenging to eliminate all safety incidents at all times.30

Table of ContentsAt
 our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, our employees, contractors and others are often in close proximity to large pieces ofequipment,
 moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites, we are responsible forsafety
 and, accordingly, must implement important safety procedures and practices above what governmental regulations require. If we fail to implement suchprocedures
 or  if  the  procedures  we  implement  are  ineffective  or  are  not  followed  by  our  employees  or  others,  our  employees,  contractors  and  others  mayexperience minor, serious
 or fatal injuries. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs.Any
 of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows.
In
 addition,  our  operations  can  involve  the  delivery,  handling  and  storage  of  hazardous  chemicals,  which,  if  improperly  delivered,  handled,  stored  ordisposed
 of, could result in serious injury, death, environmental damage or property damage, and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are alsosubject
 to  regulations  dealing  with  occupational  health  and safety.  Although  we  maintain  functional  employee  groups  whose  primary  purpose  is to  ensure  weimplement effective health
 and, safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure tocomply with such regulations or p
rocedures could subject us to liability.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adv
ersely affect our results of operations.As
 of December  31, 2019,  approximately 46%  of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 71  collective bargaining agreements in place with14
 different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, including four  which are beyond expiration and 14 which willexpire during 
2020 ,  are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms thatare
 fair to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions orwork
 stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations, maydisrupt
 our operations and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Whilewe
 have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppage may have a materialadverse impact on our fin
ancial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utiliz
e qualified personnel.The
 success  of our business is dependent upon our ability  to hire, retain,  and utilize  qualified  personnel, including engineers,  licensed  operators,  waterquality
 and other operating and craft personnel, and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. From time to time, it may bedifficult
 to  attract  and  retain  qualified  individuals  with  the  expertise  and  in  the  timeframe  demanded  for  our  business  needs.  In  certain  geographic  areas,  forexample, we may not be able 
to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.In
 addition, as key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. Ifwe
 cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows may be materiall
y and adversely impacted.Financial and Market-Related Risks
Our indebtedness could affect
 our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generatesufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquid
ity needs.As
 of December  31, 2019,  our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was$9.5
 billion,  and  our  working  capital  (defined  as  current  assets  less  current  liabilities)  was  in  a  deficit  position.  Our  indebtedness  could  have  importantconsequences, including:
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;•
exposing us to interest rat e risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;•
limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;•
impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;•
requiring  that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, therebyreducing funds available 
for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;•
limiting  our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market orindustry conditions; and
•
placing us at a competi tive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.31


Table of ContentsIn order
 to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue a combinationof
 new  short-term  and  long-term  debt  securities  and  equity.  Moreover,  additional  borrowings  may  be  required  to  refinance  outstanding  indebtedness.  Debtmaturities
 and sinking fund payments in 2020 , 2021 and 2022  will  be $28 million , $310 million and $14 million ,  respectively. We can provide no assurance thatwe
 will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related riskswe now face could intensify, li
miting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms.In
 an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt, we have in the past entered into, andin the future
 may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasurylock agreements. See 
Item 7A—Quantitative and  Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However,  these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interestrate
 risk, and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties, including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments, that couldnegatively and mater
ially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our
 ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by thefinancial,
 business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other riskfactors described
 in this section, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstandingdebt,
 we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. Inaddition,
 if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund ourliquidity
 needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects tobe affected mate
rially and adversely.Our
 inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability tomeet long-term commi
tments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.In
 addition to cash from operations, we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and the capital markets to satisfy ourliquidity needs. In this reg
ard, our principal external sources of short-term liquidity are our $2.10 billion  commercial paper p rogram and our $2.25 billion  revolving credit
 facility. Our revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in March 2024, although under those terms we may request to extend theexpiration
 date  for  up  to  one  year.  We  regularly  use  our  commercial  paper  program  under  this  revolving  credit  facility  as  a  principal  source  of  short-termborrowing
 due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market. As of December  31, 2019,  American Water CapitalCorp.
 (“AWCC”), our wholly owned financing subsidiary, had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and had $786 million  of commercial paper
 outstanding and $76 million  in  outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that AWCC will be able to continue to access its commercial paperprogram
 or its revolving credit facility, when, as and if desired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidityneeds at a reasonable, or 
any, cost.Under
 the terms of our revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the termsof the credit facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit, len
ders under the credit facility wouldbe entitled to
 refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable. To avoid such adefault, a waiver or ren
egotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that wouldrestrict our operational and
 financing flexibility.Our
 ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to variousrisks
 and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significantwrite-down
 of our goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm ourbusiness
 by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that wemay believe would be in our best 
interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete.32

Table of ContentsDisruptions
 in  the  capital  markets  or  changes  in  our  credit  ratings  could  also  limit  our  ability  to  access  capital  on  terms  favorable  to  us  or  at  all.  Forexample, o
n  April 1, 2019, Moody’s Investors Service changed the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1, from A3, with a stable outlook. While the lending
 banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, ordeterioration
 of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending theterms
 of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. These or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments, and wemay
 not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or capital markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain,renew or replace commitments
 under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations andliquidity.
 Longer-term  disruptions  in  the  capital  and  credit  markets  as  a  result  of  economic,  legislative,  political  or  other  uncertainty,  including  as  a  result  ofchanges
 in U.S. tax and other laws, reduced financing alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidityneeded
 for  our  business.  Any  significant  disruption  in  the  capital,  debt  or  credit  markets,  or  financial  institution  failures  could  require  us  to  take  measures  toconserve
 cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing orsuspending
 dividend  payments,  and  reducing  other  discretionary  expenditures.  Finally,  there  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  access  the  equity  capitalmarkets to obtain finan
cing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us.Any
 of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result fromfinancial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, req
uire us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materiallyaffect our business, finan
cial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Parent
 company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable topay upstream dividends or repay funds.
Parent
 company is a holding company and, as such, it has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held bysubsidiaries. Parent company
’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cashflows
 of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company. Prior to paying dividends to parent company, ourregulated
 subsidiaries  must  comply  with  applicable  regulatory  restrictions  and  financial  obligations,  including,  for  example,  debt  service  and  preferred  andpreference
 stock dividends,  as well as applicable  corporate,  tax and other  laws and regulations  and agreements,  and our covenants  and other  agreements.  Oursubsidiaries
 are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries topay
 such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends on itscommon stock and meet its o
ther obligations.We may not be able to fully util
ize our U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards.As
 of December  31,  2019,  we  had  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  approximately $673  million and $453  million,  respectively,  andmanagement
 believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered in the future. With the enactment of the TCJA, the Companyanalyzed the impacts o
f the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, includingits NOL carryforwards, and as a resu
lt, remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change.Our
 federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 ,  and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through2038.
 We expect to fully utilize our federal NOL balance before it expires, and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficienttaxable
 income. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance inthe future would reduce our de
ferred income tax assets and our net income.Our
 actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the NOL carryforwards. Moreover,adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJ
A and other changes in income tax laws, the economy and the general business environment could affectthe
 future utilization  of our NOL carryforwards. If we are unable to fully utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future, ourfinancial position, resu
lts of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.33

Table of ContentsWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we ma
y never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that maynegatively affect our results o
f operations.Our
 total assets include $1.5 billion  of  goodwill at December 31, 2019 .  The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by anaffiliate
 of our previous owner in 2003, the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and our acquisition of Pivotal in2018.
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwillis
 recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may notbe
 recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in thepast.
We
 may  be  required  to  recognize  an  impairment  of  goodwill  in  the  future  due  to  market  conditions  or  other  factors  related  to  our  performance  or  theperformance
 of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time invaluation
 multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases incontrol
 premiums, or other circumstances. For example, in the third quarter of 2018, prior to our sale of Keystone, we strategically narrowed the scope of thatbusiness
 and, as a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $57 million .  See Note  8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in  the Notes toConsolidated Financial State
ments for further information.A
 decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, couldalso
 result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred,which
 may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be material and couldmake
 it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations ofour regulators.
Market volatility
 and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which mayrequire us to provide significant additional 
funding.The
 performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension andpostretirement
 benefit  plans.  The  value  of  these  assets  is  subject  to  market  fluctuations  and  volatility,  which  may  cause  investment  returns  to  fall  below  ourprojected
 return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pensionand
 postretirement  benefit  plans.  Additionally,  our  pension  and postretirement  benefit  plan  liabilities  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  interest  rates.  If  interest  ratesdecrease,
 our liabilities would increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, such as increases inlife
 expectancy  assumptions  and  increasing  trends  in  health  care  costs  may  also  increase  our  funding  requirements.  Future  increases  in  pension  and  otherpostretirement
 costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could benegatively affected.
In
 addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. Forexample,
 a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent thatmarket data
 compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect ourfinancial position, resu
lts of operations and cash flows.New
 accounting  standards  or  changes  to  existing  accounting  standards  could  materially  impact  how  we  report  our  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  andfinancial condition.
Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritativebodies
 or  governmental  entities  may  issue  new  pronouncements  or  new  interpretations  of  existing  accounting  standards  that  may  require  us  to  change  ouraccounting
 policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cashflow

Table of ContentsWe
 have implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002(the
 “Sarbanes-Oxley  Act”)  and  relevant  SEC  rules,  as  well  as  other  applicable  regulations.  Such  internal  controls  and  policies  have  been  and  continue  to  beclosely
 monitored  by  our  management  and  Board  of  Directors  to  ensure  continued  compliance  with  these  laws,  rules  and  regulations.  Management  is  alsoresponsible
 for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. Whilewe
 believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporarylapses in
 internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recoveryand
 non-compliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The
 inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls couldalso harm our reputation, 
increase financing costs or adversely affect our or AWCC’s ability to access the capital markets.Additional Risks Related to Our 
Market-Based Businesses We
 (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provide  performance  guarantees  with  respect  to  certain  obligations  of  our Market-Based  Businesses,  includingfinancial
 guarantees or deposits, to our public-sector and public clients, and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our Market-Based Businesses do not satisfy these obligations.
Under
 the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entitiesand
 other  customers,  American  Water  (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provides  guarantees  of  specified  performance  obligations  of  our Market-Based Businesses
,  including financial guarantees or deposits, primarily related to MSG. In the event our Market-Based Businesses  fail  to perform these obligations, theentity holding
 the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against American Water (excluding our regulated subsidiaries) or proceed againstthe deposit. In that event, ou
r financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected.At 
December 31, 2019, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by  remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $5.4 billion  related to
 MSG’s contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if the number of bases served by MSG increases. The presence of these commitments may adverselyaffect our financial condition
 and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.Our Market-Based Businesses’ operations under MSG are subject to various risks associated wi
th doing business with the U.S. government.MSG
 enters  into  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  contracts  may  beterminated,
 in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by thesubsidiary
 performing  the  contract.  In  addition,  the  contract  price  for  each  of  these  military  contracts  is  typically  subject  to  either  an  annual  economic  priceadjustment,
 or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. Annual economic price adjustment is an inflationindex-based
 contract price increase mechanism. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflectchanges
 in  contract  obligations  and  anticipated  market  conditions.  Any  early  contract  termination  or  unfavorable  annual  economic  price  adjustment  or  priceredetermination cou
ld adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Moreover, entering
 into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the levelof
 government  spending  and  compliance  with  and  changes  in  governmental  procurement  and  security  regulations.  We  are  subject  to  potential  governmentinvestigations
 of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with theseregulations
 can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or barred from biddingon or
 receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations and c
ash flows.ITEM 1B.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Dive
rsionsCompliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions
Under the 2009 Order, Cal Am is
 required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to aset
 reduction schedule. The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of waterfrom
 the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies, theSWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving the 2021 Deadline.
The
 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased useof water at existing service
 addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a decisiondirecting
 modifications in Cal Am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from theSWRCB
 with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter toCal
 Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. In March 2018, theMPWMD
 adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. In May 2018, CalAm
 notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. Inan attempt to resolve
 these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. TheSWRCB
 agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter, which would be subject to a public comment period. Any failure to follow the MPWMD’sresolution
 or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against CalAm.

Table of ContentsThe
 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1,000 acre-feet per year of water from a source other than the WaterSupply
 Project, proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the SWRCB for consideration. In May 2018, certain parties to theWater Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to
 the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the 2009 Order for 2019, 2020, and 2021, based on the proposedexpansion
 of the Pure Water Monterey project, another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the Monterey peninsula. Petitioners claim thatcompliance
 with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of Cal Am’s unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River by 2021. A preliminaryreport
 on feasibility concluded that the expanded Pure Water Monterey project could provide an additional 2,250 acre-feet of water per year. Cal Am believes that(i)
 the petition is premature, (ii) the expanded Pure Water Monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and, even if construction issuccessfully
 completed,  would  provide  an  insufficient  quantity  of  water  to  allow  full  compliance  with  the  2009  Order,  and  (iii)  the  imposition  of  parallelmilestones would distract 
from completion of the Water Supply Project. On December 13, 2019, the SWRCB dismissed the petition without prejudice.Cal Am continues to
 work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals forthe Water Supply Project. However, based on
 the matters discussed below in “Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project,” there can be no assurance that the WaterSupply
 Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Due to the delay in the approval schedule, Cal Am currently does notbelieve
 that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order,including
 the  2021  Deadline.  The  CPUC’s  final  decision  approving  the  Water  Supply  Project  permits  recovery  of  all  of  Cal  Am’s  prudently  incurred  costsassociated therewith,
 subject to the frameworks set forth in the final decision related to cost caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters.  CalAm
 currently believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.  Further attempts tocomply
 with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, or the 2021 Deadline, may result in material additional costs or obligations to Cal Am, and failure to complycould lead to fines and pena
lties against Cal Am.Regional Desalination Project Litigation
Review of CPUC-Approved Settlement Agreement
The
 Regional Desalination Project (the “RDP”) involved the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina, north of Monterey. The RDP wasintended
 to,  among  other  things,  eliminate  unauthorized  diversions  from  the  Carmel  River  as  required  under  the  2009  Order.  In  December  2010,  the  CPUCapproved
 the RDP, which was to be implemented  through a Water  Purchase  Agreement  and ancillary  agreements  (collectively,  the  “Agreements”)  among theMarina
 Coast  Water  District  (“MCWD”),  the  Monterey  County  Water  Resources  Agency  (“MCWRA”)  and  Cal  Am.  In  2011,  due  to  a  conflict  of  interestconcerning
 a  former  member  of  MCWRA’s  Board  of  Directors,  MCWRA  stated  that  the  Agreements  were  void,  and,  as  a  result,  Cal  Am  terminated  theAgreements. In
 April 2015, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among Cal Am, MCWRA and the County of Monterey to resolve these matters among theparties
 signing the agreement. In March 2016, the Supreme Court of California granted MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC approval, and following thecourt’s
 disposition of a related issue in another case, MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC-approved settlement agreement was remanded to the CPUC. OnSeptember
 19, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision affirming its prior decisions with respect to the settlement agreement that resolved matters among the partiesthereto associated with 
the termination of the RDP agreements, after considering the issue remanded by the California Supreme Court.Cal Am’s Action for Damages Following RDP Termination
In
 October 2012, Cal Am filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against MCWRA and MCWD, which was ultimately transferred to the San FranciscoCounty Superior Court, seeking a
 determination as to whether the Agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest. In June 2015, the court entereda
 final judgment agreeing with Cal Am’s position that four of the five Agreements are void, and one, the credit line agreement, is not void. In November 2016, theSupreme
 Court  of  California  denied  MCWD’s  final  appeal  of  this  judgment,  which  allows  further  proceedings,  discussed  below,  to  determine  the  amount  ofdamages that may be award
ed in the proceeding.In
 July  2015,  Cal  Am  and  MCWRA  filed  a  Complaint  in  San  Francisco  County  Superior  Court  against  MCWD  and  RMC  Water  and  Environment(“RMC”),
 a private engineering consulting firm which has since been acquired by a national engineering, science and operations company, seeking to recovercompensatory
 damages in excess of $10 million associated with the failure of the RDP, as well as punitive and treble damages, statutory penalties and attorneys’fees.
 Shortly thereafter, complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court by MCWD and RMC against Cal Am and MCWRA in excess of $19million
 in the aggregate. In December 2015, the court consolidated all of these complaints into a single action. On February 15, 2019, the court granted Cal Am’smotion for summary judgmen
t, and as a result, no claims remain pending against Cal Am in this action. On February 25, 2019, the court granted RMC’s motion forjudgment
 on the pleadings as to certain of Cal Am’s tort claims against it. On June 20, 2019, the court granted MCWD’s motion for summary judgment related toCal
 Am’s tort claims against MCWD, which Cal Am appealed to the California Court of Appeal, and on January 14, 2020, this appeal was denied. On January 17, 2019, a motion filed by MCWD for summa
ry judgment against Cal Am relating to the contract claims in Cal Am’s complaint was denied.37

Table of ContentsTrial in
 this lawsuit had been scheduled to take place in January 2020. On January 27, 2020, the parties to this lawsuit reached a tentative agreement, whichwas
 entered into the court record and would resolve the litigation in part without trial. Under the terms of this tentative agreement, MCWD and RMC would payCal
 Am  an  aggregate  of  $5.2  million  in  settlement  of  Cal  Am’s  contract  claims  against  MCWD  and  all  claims  against  RMC  relating  to  the  RDP. Under  thisagreement, Cal Am’s and MCWRA’s right to appeal the dismis
sal of their tort claims against MCWD would be expressly reserved. A draft settlement agreement isbeing reviewed and negotiat
ed by the parties. Once executed, the settlement agreement would be subject to approval of the San Francisco County Superior Court.Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project
Cal
 Am’s  ability  to  move  forward  on  the  Water  Supply  Project  is  and  has  been  subject  to  extensive  administrative  review  by  the  CPUC  and  othergovernment
 agencies,  obtaining  necessary  permits,  and  intervention  from  other  parties.  In  September  2016,  the  CPUC  unanimously  approved  a  decision  toauthorize
 Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $50million in associated 
costs, subject to meeting certain criteria. If construction costs exceed $50 million, Cal Am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery.In
 September 2018, the CPUC unanimously adopted a final decision finding that (i) the Water Supply Project, based on Cal Am’s request for a 6.4 milliongallons
 per day desalination plant, meets the CPUC’s requirements for a CPCN, (ii) the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed, and (iii) an additionalprocedural
 phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s decision directs Cal Am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of theGWR
 Project  between  Monterey  One  Water  and  the  MPWMD  and  to  indicate  whether  Cal  Am  plans  to  file  an  application  for  approval  of  an  agreement  topurchase additional water from the GWR Project. The decisi
on notes, however, that the CPUC will only consider such an application if the Water Supply Project isdelayed
 such  that  Cal  Am  would  not  be  able  to  meet  the  2021  Deadline.  The  decision  accepts  Cal  Am’s  estimates  of  future  water  demand  in  Monterey  andconcludes
 that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address those needs, and adopts Cal Am’s most recent cost estimates. The decision also allows CalAm
 to  earn  an  allowance  for  funds  used  during  construction,  or  AFUDC,  at  a  rate  representative  of  its  actual  financing  costs.  The  final  decision  adoptedframeworks as to cost caps, O&M cos
ts, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters.In
 addition,  the  CPUC  final  decision  imposes  numerous  reporting  and  filing  requirements  to  ensure  the  expenditures  for  the  Water  Supply  Project  arereasonable, including that
 the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers, and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within theauthorized
 cost caps. The reasonableness of Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by Cal Am after the Water SupplyProject
 becomes operational. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from theconstruction
 and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUCcosts associated with that p
rogram, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service.In
 February 2019, the City of Marina and MCWD filed petitions for writ of review before the Supreme Court of California challenging the sufficiency ofthe final
 Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement adopted by the CPUC in September 2018, which the court declined to consider on August28, 2019.
On
 July 2, 2019, Cal Am notified  MPWMD and Monterey One Water  (collectively,  the “Agencies”)  that an event  of default  occurred  under the waterpurchase agreement
 for the GWR Project because the Agencies failed to deliver to Cal Am by July 1, 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the GWRProject.
 Under  the  water  purchase  agreement,  upon  the  occurrence  of  this  event  of  default,  Cal  Am  had  the  right  to  terminate  the  water  purchase  agreementimmediately.
 Cal Am has elected not to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time, but in its notification to the Agencies, Cal Amexpressly
 reserved its right to terminate the water purchase agreement until such time as the Agencies commence their required delivery of water from the GWRProject.
 On July 16, 2019, MPWMD and Monterey One Water responded to Cal Am’s event of default notice and estimated that water delivery would begin bymid-October 2019. On Decem
ber 12, 2019, Cal Am sent a letter to the Agencies requesting a status update with respect to the event of default. On January 2, 2020,Cal
 Am notified the Agencies that a second event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement because the Agencies failed to achieve the PerformanceStart Date (the
 date upon which MPWMD’s performance obligations under the water purchase agreement were to commence) by January 1, 2020. Under the waterpurchase
 agreement,  upon  the  occurrence  of  this  event  of  default,  Cal  Am  had  the  right  to  terminate  the  water  purchase  agreement  immediately.  Cal  Am  haselected not
 to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time, but in its notification to the Agencies, Cal Am expressly reserved its right toterminate
 the water purchase agreement until such time as the Performance Start Date has occurred. On January 9, 2020, the Agencies responded to Cal Am’sDecember
 12,  2019  and  January  2,  2020  letters.  In  the  response,  the  Agencies  acknowledged  they  remain  in  default  under  the  water  purchase  agreement  butindicated that corrective action i
s being taken to attain the Performance Start Date in the near future.38

Table of ContentsOn
 April 17,  2019, Water  Ratepayers  Association  of  the Monterey  Peninsula  (“WRAMP”), a  citizens’  advocacy  group, filed  an  amended  complaint  inMonterey
 County Superior Court asserting a “qui tam” claim under the California False Claims Act on behalf of itself and the State of California against Cal Amand
 certain environmental consultants who worked on the CPUC’s environmental analysis of the MPWSP. The State Attorney General declined to proceed withthis
 action  after  it  was originally  filed  in  2016. On July  10, 2019,  defendants  filed  a  joint  demurrer  challenging  the  legal  sufficiency  of  the  allegations  of  theamended complaint.
 At an August 27, 2019 hearing on the demurrer, the court dismissed the petition without leave to amend. On October 17, 2019, WRAMP filedmotions
 seeking clarification and a reconsideration of the court’s ruling. A hearing on these motions was set for December 3, 2019, but on November 26, 2019,WRAMP abandoned its motions and instead f
iled an appeal of the court’s dismissal. This appeal remains pending.Coastal Development Permit Application
In
 June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina for those project components of the Water Supply Projectlocated
 within the City of Marina’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed oppositionto
 the Water Supply Project. On March 7, 2019, the City of Marina Planning Commission adopted a resolution denying Cal Am’s coastal development permitapplication.
 Cal Am appealed the Marina Planning Commission's decision to the City Council, which set a public hearing on the appeal for April 30, 2019. OnApril
 25, 2019, Cal Am submitted a letter to the City challenging the impartiality of the City and three of its council members with respect to the Water SupplyProject.
 On  April  29,  2019,  the  City  informed  Cal  Am  that  it  intended  to  proceed  with  the  hearing  with  the  participation  of  the  challenged  City  Councilmembers.
 As a result, on April 29, 2019, Cal Am notified the City that it was withdrawing its appeal, as Cal Am believes it could not receive a fair and impartialhearing before the City Counci
l.On
 May  10,  2019,  the  City  issued  a  notice  of  final  local  action  based  upon  the  Marina  Planning  Commission’s  decision.  On  May  22,  2019,  Cal  Amappealed
 this decision to the California Coastal Commission (the “Coastal Commission”), as permitted under the City’s code and the California Coastal Act. OnOctober 28, 2019, staff of the Coasta
l Commission issued a report recommending a denial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit with respect tothe
 Water Supply Project, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in itsfinal
 decision  approving  the  Water  Supply  Project.  Staffs  of  the  CPUC  and  the  Coastal  Commission  met  to  discuss  the  Coastal  Commission’s  staffrecommendation,
 at which time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staff’s findings on water supply and demand, groundwater impacts andother
 matters. On November 4, 2019, Coastal Commission staff released an addendum to the staff report, concluding that additional groundwater modeling wasneeded
 before staff could find that the Water Supply Project would not prevent depletion of groundwater supplies. At its November 14, 2019 hearing on both theappeal
 from the City of Marina’s denial and Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction, CoastalCommission staff advised that no vote wo
uld be taken at the meeting and that further investigation was required in light of the CPUC staff’s questions. The hearingwas
 continued to a later date. On January 28, 2020, Coastal Commission staff recommended to Cal Am that it withdraw its application for a coastal developmentpermit
 within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction and resubmit such application at a later date, as the staff believes that its additional investigationcould not be completed in t
ime for a vote on Cal Am’s existing application. The staff indicated that such a withdrawal would not affect Cal Am’s appeal of the Cityof
 Marin’s denial, which would remain pending. Cal Am has declined to withdraw its application, and instead, on February 12, 2020, Cal Am and the CoastalCommission
 entered into a stipulation extending by 90 days, to July 24, 2020, the deadline for the Coastal Commission to vote on Cal Am’s original jurisdictionapplication.
Desalination Plant Development Permit
The
 proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County, California on a site ownedby
 CEMEX, Inc. (“CEMEX”), and requires a combined development permit from the County of Monterey prior to commencement of construction. On April 24,2019,
 the County’s Planning Commission voted to approve the permit. On July 15, 2019, the Board of Supervisors heard appeals filed by MCWD and a publicadvocacy
 group, at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit. On  August 21, 2019, MCWD filed a petition in Monterey County Superior Courtchallenging
 Monterey County’s approval of Cal Am’s combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and CalAm
 from commencing construction of the desalination plant. On October 9, 2019, after a hearing, the court denied, without prejudice, MCWD’s motion for apreliminary
 injunction, but issued a stay of the County’s approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of thedesalination plant
 until November 19, 2019, at which time the parties were to advise the court of the Coastal Commission’s decision on Cal Am’s application for acoastal
 development permit for the slant wells needed to source water for the desalination plant. In the interim, Cal Am is allowed to continue to obtain permitsneeded
 for the desalination plant’s construction. On  November 19, 2019, the parties  informed  the court that the Coastal Commission had continued its publichearing on the slant wells and h
ad not yet made a determination about permitting the slant wells. In response, the court continued its stay until March 24, 2020.39

Table of ContentsProposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells
In
 August 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the matterfor
 consideration on the Planning Commission’s agenda for its September 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the CEMEX site toopen
 space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any change to theCity's
 local  coastal  program  must  ultimately  be  approved  by  the  Coastal  Commission.  Cal  Am,  CEMEX  and  the  Coastal  Commission  each  submitted  lettersopposing
 the proposed amendments. At its November 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina City Councilconsider approving the amend
ments.In
 December 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted lettersopposing
 the  proposed  changes,  but  the  City  Council  unanimously  adopted  a  resolution  amending  its  local  coastal  plan  and  a  draft  amendment  to  its  zoningordinance.
 Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the City’s December 2018 meeting. The changes to thelocal coastal plan mus
t be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained.Test Slant Well Permitting
A
 preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability ofthe
 property  on  which  intake  wells  will  be  located  to  draw  water  from  under  Monterey  Bay.  In  November  2014,  the  Coastal  Commission  approved  coastaldevelopment
 permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of theslant
 wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain inplace
 and be maintained until February 28, 2020. On November 27, 2019, Cal Am filed an application with the Coastal Commission for a permit amendment toallow
 the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 28, 2021. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission, asamended,
 will expire on December 16, 2022. Effective February 28, 2018, test slant well pumping ceased, except for minimal maintenance pumping activities, inaccordance with Cal Am’s coas
tal development permits.In
 November 2015, MCWD filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Santa Cruz County Superior Courtagainst
 the Coastal Commission and Cal Am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test wellpumping.
 In orders issued in September 2016 and October 2017, the court denied MCWD’s challenges. In January 2018, MCWD filed a notice of appeal of thecourt’s
 judgment. On  June 28, 2019, the California Court of Appeal dismissed MCWD’s appeal. On July 15, 2019, MCWD filed a petition for rehearing with theCourt of Appeal, which was denied on July 19, 2019. This dec
ision is now final.Water Supply Project Land Acquisit
ion and Slant Well Site UseIn
 July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned byCEMEX
 on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit orgovernmental
 entity. The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistentwith existing easements and other rights of record. A
 permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June 2018 to allow Cal Am access to theproperty
 and to construct, operate and maintain the Water Supply Project intake wells. On November 26, 2019, the City of Marina notified CEMEX that, based onthis
 easement and Cal Am’s proposed use of the site for the intake wells, CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement (to whichCal
 Am was not a party). The City states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Am’s extraction is limited to 500acre-feet
 per year of groundwater, that Cal Am cannot export extracted water out of the basin, and that the permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am isvoid.
 The City has requested a meeting with CEMEX as part of a mandatory dispute resolution process under the annexation agreement prior to filing a lawsuit.CEMEX
 has denied the City’s claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of the permanent easement. Cal Am and CEMEX believe thatthere
 is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on Cal Am’s right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use byCal Am’s customers.
Under
 California’s  Sustainable  Groundwater  Management  Act  (“SGMA”)  enacted  in  2015,  groundwater  basins  designated  by  the  state  as  criticallyoverdrafted
 must be managed by a groundwater sustainability agency (“GSA”) by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan (“GSP”)designed
 to  achieve  sustainability  by  2040.  Under  the  SGMA,  GSAs  have  broad  powers  to  achieve  sustainability  including,  but  not  limited  to,  regulatinggroundwater
 extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating, limiting or suspending extractionsfrom
 wells.  The  400-acre  CEMEX  site  overlies  a  small  portion  of  the  180/400  Subbasin  of  the  Salinas  Valley  Groundwater  Basin;  the  84,000-acre  180/400Subbasin has been designated by the st
ate as critically overdrafted, mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin.40

Table of ContentsIn
 late 2016, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (“SVBGSA”) was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA for theSalinas Valley Ground
water Basin and prepare a GSP. In April 2018, the City of Marina filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlapwith
 the SVBGSA’s filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSA commenced preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180/400 subbasin, including theCEMEX
 site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site with the intent to severely limit or prohibitgroundwater
 pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (“SDWR”) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will not acceptthe
 GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December 2019, the Countyof
 Monterey  filed  its  own  notice  to  become  the  exclusive  GSA  at  the  CEMEX  site  in  order  to  resolve  the  overlap,  which  is  permitted  under  SGMA.  SDWRaccepted the County’s fil
ing on December 18, 2019, and now lists the County as the exclusive GSA for the site.On
 December 30, 2019, the City of Marina filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of California challenging the County’s filing, and SDWR’s acceptance ofthe filing, as the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site. The City has
 named the County and its Board of Supervisors, the County GSA, and SDWR and its director asdefendants,
 and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The City seeks to invalidate the County’s filing, as well as injunctive relief to preserve theCity’s
 status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit, which is scheduled to be heard onFebruary 18, 2020.

Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part ofWVAWC’s
 West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure to up to approximately25,000
 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,2015,
 a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20%by
 the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  wasreconfigured
 to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fullyrestored on July 1, 2015 to all custo
mers affected by this event.On
 June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries,  et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was  filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in KanawhaCounty
 on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaintalleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regardi
ng the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligenceby
 WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries  plaintiffs  seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lostprofits,
 annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipefailure and a large outage.
In
 October 2017, WVAWC filed with the court a motion seeking to dismiss all of the Jeffries plaintiffs’  counts alleging statutory and common law tortclaims.
 Furthermore,  WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegationsinvolving
 violations of the applicable tariff, the public utility code and related rules. In May 2018, the court, at a hearing, denied WVAWC’s motion to apply theprimary
 jurisdiction  doctrine,  and  in  October  2018,  the  court  issued  a  written  order  to  that  effect.  On  February  21,  2019,  the  court  issued  an  order  denyingWVAWC’s
 motion to dismiss the Jeffries plaintiffs’  tort claims. On August 21, 2019, the court set a procedural schedule in this case, including a trial date ofSeptember 21, 2020.
 Discovery in this case is ongoing. On February 4, 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed  a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breachof contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if impo
sed. A hearing on class certification iscurrently scheduled for M
arch 11, 2020.The
 Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will continueto vigorously defend itself 
against these allegations.Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On
 September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“TAWC”), experienced a break of a 36-inchwater
 transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the mainbreak
 by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon on September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for allcustomers on September 16, 2019.

 — East Palo Alto Water System Voluntary Report In
 April 2017, AWE, the parent entity of CSG ,  voluntarily reported to the Division of Drinking Water of the SWRCB potential violations of the CaliforniaSafe
 Drinking Water Act (the “CSDWA”) in connection with AWE’s operation of the City of East Palo Alto’s water distribution system. Upon the resignation ofthe
 system’s  general  manager  in  March  2017,  AWE  discovered  that  it  may  have  operated  the  system  without  a  properly  certified  operator  for  two  years,  thetriennial
 LCR sampling was not completed, and the 2015 Consumer Confidence Report improperly reported data for lead and copper samples from the system’supstream water provider. Promptly after discovering these
 issues, AWE engaged an outside law firm to conduct an internal investigation and reported the results ofthat investigation to th
e SWRCB.On
 June 15, 2017, the SWRCB issued to AWE a citation that required AWE to, among other things: comply with regulations related to water operatorcertifications,
 lead and copper tap sampling requirements and the publishing of a Consumer Confidence Report; provide public notification of the LCR violation;and
 prepare  a  corrective  action  plan  to  evaluate  the  causes  leading  to  these  incidents  and  measures  to  be  taken  to  prevent  recurrence  of  future  incidents.  Thecitation did not impose on AWE any 
monetary penalties, but the SWRCB reserved the right to take additional enforcement action.In
 October 2017, the SWRCB advised AWE that it is in compliance with all of the directives and relevant statutory and administrative provisions specifiedin
 the SWRCB’s June 2017 citation. In February 2018, the SWRCB referred this matter to the San Mateo County, California District Attorney’s office for furtherinvestigation. AWE
 continues to cooperate with the SWRCB, the City of East Palo Alto and the San Mateo County District Attorney regarding this matter. Provenviolations of the CSDWA may result in 
civil and criminal penalties.General

Adjusted
 diluted earnings per share represents a non-GAAP financial measure and, as shown in the table above, is calculated as GAAP diluted earnings pershare,
 excluding the impact of one or more of the following events: (i) a loss on the sale in the fourth quarter of 2019 of the Keystone operations; (ii) previouslyreported settlement activities
 related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia; (iii) a gain recognized in the third quarter of 2018 on the sale of themajority
 of CSG ’s  O&M contracts; (iv) a goodwill and intangible impairment charge in the third quarter of 2018 related to the Keystone operations; (v) an earlyextinguishment
 of debt charge at parent company in the third quarter of 2017; and (vi) non-cash re-measurement charges recorded in the fourth quarters of 2017and
 2018 resulting from the impact of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on the Company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of theTCJA.
The
 Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful information by excluding certain matters that may not be indicative ofits
 ongoing  operating  results,  and  that  providing  this  non-GAAP  measure  will  allow  investors  to  better  understand  the  businesses’  operating  performance  andfacilitate a
 meaningful year-to-year comparison of the Company’s results of operations. Although management uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally toevaluate
 its results of operations, the Company does not intend results reflected by this non-GAAP measure to represent results as defined by GAAP, and thereader
 should  not  consider  them  as  indicators  of  performance.  This  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  derived  from  the  Company’s  consolidated  financialinformation
 but is not presented in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as asubstitute
 for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure as defined and used above,may not be comparable to s
imilarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, may have significant limitations on its use.Growth—through
 capital  investment  in  infrastructure  and  regulated  acquisitions,  as  well  as  strategic  growth  opportunities  in  the Market-Based Businesses
The
 Company expects to continue to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses  through  (i) continuedcapital investment
 in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulatedacquisitions
 to expand the Company’s services to new customers. The Company also expects to continue to grow the Market-Based Businesses ,  which leveragesits core water and wastewat
er competencies. In 2019 ,  the Company invested $1.9 billion , primarily in the Regulated Businesses , as discussed below: Regulated Businesses
 Growth and Optimization •
$1.7 billion  capital investment in the Regulated Businesses , the majority for inf rastructure improvements and replacements.•
$235 million  to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses , which added approximately 53,100  water and wastewater custom ers.•
The Company has entered into agr eements for pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses  to add approximately 44,200  customers. On 
November  20,  2019,  the  Company  and  its  New  York  subsidiary  entered  into  a  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  with  Liberty  Utilities  Co.  (“Liberty”),pursuant
 to  which  Liberty  will  purchase  all  of  the  capital  stock  of  the  New  York  subsidiary  (the  “Stock  Purchase”)  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  ofapproximately 
$608 million  in  cash, subject to adjustment as provided in that agreement. The New York subsidiary includes all of the water and wastewater assetsof
 the  Company’s  New  York  regulated  utility  operations,  with  approximately 125,000  customer  connections  in  the  State  of  New  York.  Algonquin  Power  &Utilities
 Corp., Liberty’s parent company, executed and delivered an absolute and unconditional guaranty of the performance of all of Liberty’s obligations underthe stock purchase agree
ment.The
 Stock Purchase is subject to various conditions, including obtaining regulatory approval, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periodunder
 the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law and other customary closing conditions. The stock purchase agreement may be terminated by either party if theStock
 Purchase is not completed by June 30, 2021, subject to extension for up to six months if all of the conditions to closing have been met, other than obtainingregulatory
 approvals.  Liberty  may  also  terminate  the  stock  purchase  agreement  if  any  governmental  authority  initiates  a  condemnation  or  eminent  domainproceeding
 against  a  majority  of  the  consolidated  properties  of  the  New  York  subsidiary,  taken  as  a  whole.  The  Company  currently  estimates  that  the  StockPurchase
 is  to  be  completed  by  early  2021.  Accordingly,  the  assets  and  related  liabilities  of  the  New  York  subsidiary  were  classified  as  held  for  sale  onthe

Operational Excellence
The
 Company continues to strive for industry-leading operational efficiency, driven largely by technology. The Company’s technology investments areaimed at enhancing its cu
stomer experience and operational efficiency.•
In 2019: •
the Regulated Businesses achieved an adjusted O&M ef ficiency ratio (a non-GAAP measure) of 34.5%  for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared
 to 35.6%  and 35.3%  for  the years ended December  31, 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively. The improvement in the Company’s adjustedO&M
 efficiency ratio in 2019 ,  when compared to 2018 ,  was due to an increase in operating revenues as well as continued focus on operatingcosts of the Regulated Businesses;
•
the  Company worked to decrease costs and deploy capital efficiently, including using trenchless technologies for pipeline rehabilitation andleveraging its buying power and st
rategic sourcing to drive cost savings;•
the  Company  continued  its  commitment  to  water  quality  and  the  environment  by  leveraging  new  technologies;  the  Company  now  hasadvanced
 water quality sensors at all of its major drinking water intake sites and is automating its environmental reporting and compliancesystems; and
•
the  Company  implemented  other  technology  tools  that  will  enhance  communication,  collaboration  and  mobility,  enable  further  businessinsights
 and  process  automation,  and  increase  self-service  capabilities,  to  help  its  employees  work  safely  and  efficiently,  and  enhance  thecustomer experience.
•
Looking forward, the Company will focus on t echnology and efficiency to:•
be  the leader in optimizing technology across the water and wastewater industry, with a focus on specific, innovative projects that will set itapart
 from other utilities; aiding the Company in serving its customers with greater ease, making the Company’s employees safer and helpingthe Company operate more e
fficiently; and•
further improve the Company ’s adjusted O&M efficiency ratio.48

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s adjusted O&M efficiency ratio is defined as its operation and maintenance expenses from the Regulated  Businesses,  divided by the proforma
 operating revenues from the Regulated  Businesses,  where both operation and maintenance expenses and pro forma operating revenues were adjusted toeliminate
 purchased water expense. Also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses are the allocable portion of non-operation and maintenance supportservices
 costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, which are reflected in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but forconsolidated financia
l reporting purposes, are categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.In
 addition to the adjustments discussed above, for period-to-period comparability purposes, the estimated impact of the TCJA on operating revenues forthe 
Regulated Businesses has  been presented on a pro forma basis for all periods prior to January 1, 2018, as if the lower federal corporate income tax rate was ineffect
 for these periods. The Company also made the following adjustments to the O&M efficiency ratio: (i) excluded from operation and maintenance expenses isthe impact
 of certain Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2017, 2018 and 2019 (see Note 16—Commitments and Contingenci es in the
 Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional  information);  and  (ii)  excluded  from  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  is  the  impact  of  theCompany’s
 January 1, 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Improving  the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-Retirement
 Benefit Cost (“ASU  2017-07”), for 2017, 2018 and 2019. The items discussed above were excluded from the calculation as they are not reflective ofmanagement’s ability to increase
 the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses . The
 Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors, because it directly measures improvement in theefficiency
 of the Regulated  Businesses.  This information is derived from the Company’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financialstatements
 prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  This  information  is  intended  to  enhance  an  investor’s  overall  understanding  of  the  Company’s  operatingperformance.
 The Company’s adjusted O&M efficiency ratio is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP, may not be comparable to other companies’operating measures and should no
t be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.49

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On 
December 22, 2017,  the  TCJA was  signed  into  law,  which,  among  other  things,  enacted  significant  and  complex  changes  to  the  Code,  including  areduction
 in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35%  to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utilityindustry,
 including continuation of interest expense deductibility, the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income taxes.In
 2018, the Company’s 14  regulatory jurisdictions began to seek to address the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates to reflect thelower income tax rate in 
11  states. In one  of those 11  states, a portion of the tax savings is being used to reduce certain regulatory assets. In one  additional state, theCompany
 is using the tax savings to offset additional capital investment and to reduce a regulatory asset. Proceedings in the other two regulatory jurisdictionsremain pending.
52

Table of ContentsThe
 enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes that materially impacted its 2017 results of operations andfinancial
 position.  The  portion  of  this  re-measurement  related  to  the  Regulated  Businesses  was  substantially  offset  by  a  regulatory  liability,  as  the  Companybelieves
 it is probable that the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) created by the TCJA will be used to benefit its regulated customers in futurerates. 
Six  of  the  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries  are  amortizing  EADIT  and  crediting  customers,  including one  which  is  using  the  EADIT  to  offset  futureinfrastructure
 investments. The Company expects the timing of the amortization of EADIT credits by the eight  remaining  regulated subsidiaries to be addressed inpending or future rate c
ases or other proceedings.On
 March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (the “CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA corrects and clarifies some aspects of theTCJA
 related to bonus depreciation eligibility. Specifically, property that was either acquired, or as to which construction began prior to September 27, 2017, iseligible
 for bonus depreciation. The Company had a federal NOL carryover balance as of December 31, 2019 that is not expected to be fully utilized until 2020,which is when the Company expects that 
it will become a cash taxpayer for federal income tax purposes.Legislative Updates
In
 Illinois,  the  Governor  signed  a  10-year  extension  of  the  Water  Systems  Viability  Act,  Illinois’  fair  market  value  legislation,  in  2018,  which  becameeffective in 2019.
 In addition to extending the act, the updated law removes the previous restriction on the size of water or wastewater systems that can be acquiredand allows all municipalitie
s to take advantage of the benefits of the program.During 2019, the Company’s regulatory ju
risdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of December 31, 2019:•
Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 472 allows non-municipal utilities to benefit from full appraisal recovery of their assets in a sale.•
Indiana House Enrolled Act 1406 estab lished the first state appropriation for water infrastructure investment at $20 million per year.•
Indiana  Senate Enrolled Act 4 extends leveling legislation to require biannual water loss audits and establishes the state revolving fund administratoras the central coordin
ator for water issues in the state.•
In  Pennsylvania, House Bill 751, now Act 53 of 2019, allows water and wastewater utilities responsible for funding the income taxes on taxablecontributions and advances to 
record the income taxes paid in accumulated deferred income taxes for accounting and ratemaking purposes.•
In West Virginia, House Bill 117 al lows qualified low income customers to apply for a 20% discount on their wastewater bill.53

Table of ContentsOperating Supplies and Services
In 
2019,  operating supplies and services increased  $10 million primarily  due to higher costs for technology services, including higher software licensingcosts and technical support, 
and expenses related to various projects in the Company’s California subsidiary, as well as an increase in other operating expenses.Maintenance Materials and Suppl
iesIn 
2019,  maintenance materials and supplies decreased  $7 million primarily  due to higher volume of main breaks and paving costs, driven by the colderweather experienced dur
ing the first quarter of 2018.Customer Billing and Accounting
In 
2019, customer billing and ac counting decreased  $5 million from a decrease in customer  uncollectible expense.Other (Operation and Maintenance)
In 
2019,  other (operation and maintenance) increased  $10 million primarily  due to a $20 million benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2018, resultingfrom
 an insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia, offset in part by (i) a $4 million reduction to the liability related tothe
 Freedom Industries chemical spill, recorded in the first quarter of 2019, and (ii) an increase in operating revenues and O&M expense during 2018 resultingfrom
 the authorization for the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary to use a portion of the income tax savings resulting from the TCJA for accelerated recovery ofcertain regulatory assets.
Depreciation and Amortization
In 
2019, depreciation and amor tization increased  $29 million primarily due to additio nal utility plant placed in service from investments.Other Income (Expenses)
In 
2019,  other income (expenses) decreased  $15 million primarily  due to an increase in interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt inthe second
 quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2018 to support growth of the business, partially offset by interest savings from early debt redemptions and tax-exempt bond refinancings dur
ing 2019.Provision for Income Taxes
For the year ended 
December 31, 2019 , the Company’s provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate.Market-Based Businesses

$5 million  increase in employee-related co sts primarily in HOS  and MSG  due to growth in the  business, partially offset by lower costs resulting fromthe
 sale of the majority of CSG ’s  O&M contracts and the exit of the construction business at Keystone, both occurring during the third quarter of2018; partially offset by a

ed above.Depreciation and Amortization
In 
2019, depreciation and amor tization increased  $8 million primarily due to the a cquisition of Pivotal in the second quarter of 2018.Loss (Gain) on Asset Dispositions and Purchases
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on sale of 
$44 million , or $35 million after-tax, rela ting to the sale of its Keystoneoperations. See 
Note  4—Acquisitions and Divestitures in  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, during the thirdquarter of 2018, the Company recogn
ized a pre-tax gain of $14 million  on the sale of the major ity of CSG ’s O&M contracts. Impairment Charge
During
 the third quarter of 2018, a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $57 million  was recorded  for Keystone, the result of operational andfinancial challeng
es encountered in the construction business, and the Company’s determination to narrow the scope of the Keystone operations to focus on its coreoperations
 of  providing  water  transfer  services.  See Note  8—Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  foradditional information.

Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes
In 
2019, provision for income taxes increased  $9 million primarily due to an increa se in pre-tax income.Liquidity and Capital Resources
The
 Company  regularly  evaluates  and  monitors  its  cash  requirements  for  capital  investments,  acquisitions,  operations,  commitments,  debt  maturities,interest
 and dividends. The Company’s business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, theCompany
 also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. The Company may alsoaccess
 the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms dependson
 its credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equitycapital
 markets, and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending theterms
 of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in thecapital markets.
If
 these  business,  market,  financial  and  other  conditions  deteriorate  to  the  extent  that  the  Company  is  no  longer  able  to  access  the  capital  markets  onreasonable
 terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2024 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion . The facility
 is used principally to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCC’s $2.10 billion  commercial  paper program and to provide a sublimit of upto 
$150 million for  letters of credit. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under thefacility by up to 
$500 million . In
 order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. As of December  31, 2019, AWCC
 had no  outstanding borrowings and $76 million  of  outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $2.25 billion  available  to fulfill itsshort-term liquidity needs, to issue letters of
 credit, and to provide support for $786 million  in outstanding commercial  paper. The Company believes that its abilityto access the debt and equi
ty capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-term requirements. The
 Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and creditmarkets.
 However, there can no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCCwill
 be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all. See “Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt” below foradditional information.
In
 addition, the Regulated  Businesses receive  advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund constructionnecessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are refun
dable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customersbegin
 to  receive  service  or  other  contractual  obligations  are  fulfilled.  Amounts  which  are  no  longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to  contributions  in  aid  ofconstruction.
The
 Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities,(iii)
 pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) the Company estimates, during 2020, to begin to payfederal
 income taxes. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment.Additionally,
 the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recoverygenerally
 takes  place  over  an  extended  period  of  time,  and  certain  capital  recovery  is  also  subject  to  regulatory  lag.  See Item  1—Business— RegulatedBusinesses
— Regulation and Rate Making for  additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination ofexternal
 debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater thanits
 cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities forthe
 next  five  years  through  a  combination  of  long-term  debt  and  equity.  If  necessary,  the  Company  may  delay  certain  capital  investments  or  other  fundingrequirements, or
 pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meetits obligations and fund its m
inimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.With
 the enactment of the TCJA and the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%  to 21%, the Company anticipates a decrease infuture
 revenue  authorizations  associated  with  the Regulated  Businesses,  initially  leading  to  lower  cash  flows.  The  Company  expects  this  cash  flow  impact  todecline
 over time, as the Regulated  Businesses’  rate base grows, the result of lower deferred income tax liabilities, which offset rate base. The lower deferredincome
 tax  liabilities  are  mainly  due  to  (i)  a  lower  U.S.  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate,  (ii)  the  normalization  (refunding  to  customers)  of  the  re-measureddeferred
 income tax liabilities over the remaining life of the associated assets, and (iii) the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects thatbegan after September 27, 2017.

Table of ContentsOne
 component  of  WIFIA  is  a  federal  credit  program  administered  by  the  EPA  for  eligible  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure  projects.  The  WIFIAprogram
 accelerates investment in the U.S.’s water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significantprojects. The Company is curren
tly pursuing WIFIA financing of approximately $80 million  for a project in the Company ’s Missouri subsidiary.Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
Cash
 flows  provided  by  operating  activities  primarily  result  from  the  sale  of  water  and  wastewater  services  and, due  to the  seasonality  of  demand,  aregenerally
 greater during the warmer months. The Company’s future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by, among other things: economicutility
 regulation inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; maintenance costs; customer growth; declining customerusage of water; employee
-related costs, including pension funding; weather and seasonality; taxes; and overall economic conditions.The
 enactment of the TCJA is accretive to the Company’s consolidated earnings over time through (i) growth in rate base for the same level of expectedcapital
 expenditures due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the re-measurement of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities,(ii)
 increased earnings in the Market-Based Businesses  due  to the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, all partially offset by (iii) the lower tax shield oninterest expense
 at parent company, as well as increased debt levels from lower cash flows from operations as the Company passes the lower tax rate benefits to itsregulated
 customers.  The  Company  believes  that  it  will  likely  begin  paying  federal  income  taxes  during  2020,  when  the  Company  expects  its  federal  NOLcarryforwards
 balance will be fully used, although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in its future results of operations and the outcome ofregulatory proceedings r
egarding the TCJA.Cash
 flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majorityof
 the Company’s capital investments. The Company expects to seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of its capital investment, if any,and
 fund its dividend payments, as needed. Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the Company’s rate regulated environments, changes inthe 
Market-Based Businesses,  changes in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and the Company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in atimely
 manner,  among  other  items.  The  Company  can  provide  no  assurance  that  its  customers’  historical  payment  pattern  will  continue  in  the  future.  TheCompany’s
 current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the periodic use of short-term debt as a fundingsource,
 primarily  to  meet  scheduled  maturities  of  long-term  debt,  fund  acquisitions  and  construction  projects,  as  well  as  cash  needs  which  can  fluctuatesignificantly due to the s
easonality of the business. The Company addresses cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms.Presented in the table be

Table of ContentsIn 
2019, cash flows provided by operating a ctivities decreased  $3 million, primarily due to the settlement  of cash flow hedges and increased interest costs inconnection
 with  the  Company’s  $1.10  billion  debt  offering  that  closed  on  May  13,  2019  and  an  increase  in  pension  contributions.  Partially  offsetting  thesedecreases
 was an increase in net income. The main factors contributing to the increase in net income are described in “Consolidated Results of Operations” and“Segment Results of Operations” 
above.The
 Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $38 million  in 2020.  In addition, the Company estimates that contributions willamount to 
$33 million , $34 million, $34 million and $32 million  in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 ,  respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change materiallyfrom these estimat

In 
2019,  cash flows used in investing activities decreased $91 million  primarily  due to the acquisition of Pivotal for $365 million on June 4, 2018, partiallyoffset by an increase in capital expenditures, principally from incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of the Company’s transmissi
onand
 distribution infrastructure in the Regulated Businesses ,  as discussed below. The Company also had an increase of proceeds from sale of assets due to the saleof Keystone for 
$31 million , in the fourth quarter of 2019. The
 Company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces infrastructure, as needed, andmajor
 capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth andwater
 quality regulations. The Company’s projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes ineconomic conditions and othe

 Company  also  grows  its  business  primarily  through  acquisitions  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  as  well  as  other  water-related  services.  Theseacquisitions
 are complementary to the Company’s existing business and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. Generally,acquisitions are funded in
itially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with the proceeds from long-term debt, once reflected in rate base.61

Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of th
e acquisitions and dispositions affecting the Company’s cash flows from investing activities during 2019 : •
Paid $235 million  for 21 water and wastewater systems, representing in the aggregate approximately 53,100  customers. •
Received $48 million  for the sale of assets, in cluding $31 million  from the sale of the Keyston e operations.As previously noted, the
 Company expects to invest between $8.8 billion  to $9.4 billion from 2020  to 2024, with $8.2 billion  of  this range for infrastructureimprovements
 in the Regulated Businesses ,  and between $20 billion  to $22 billion from  2020 to 2029. In 2020 ,  the Company expects to invest between a range of$1.7 billion
 to $1.9 billion in 2020,  with $1.6 billion  for  infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses .  Also in 2020 ,  the Company expects to investbetween 
$100 million  to $300 million for acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses . Cash Flows from Financing Activities

In
 2019, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased  $232 million,  primarily due to the issuance of common stock in 2018, the proceeds of whichwere used
 to finance a portion of the 2018 acquisition of Pivotal, as well as an increase in cash used for dividend payments in 2019. AWCC issued $1.10 billion oflong-term
 debt as part of its May 13, 2019 debt offering, of which $51 million of the net proceeds was used to repay long-term debt obligations at maturity. Netproceeds from the debt of
fering were also used to repay pre-existing short-term borrowings, which resulted in a net cash outflow for 2019 of $178 million . The
 Company’s  financing  activities,  primarily  focused  on  funding  regulated  infrastructure  expenditures,  regulated  and  market-based  acquisitions  andpayment
 of dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC and in 2018, included an equity issuancefor
 approximately 50% of the Pivotal acquisition. In addition, new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction,net
 of refunds, which amounted to $26 million , $21 million and $28 million  for  the years ended December  31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively. Based on theneeds
 of the Regulated  Businesses and  the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans,provide those borrowings to the 
Regulated Businesses  and parent company. The Regulated Businesses  and parent  company are obligated to pay their portion of therespective
 principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent company’s borrowings are not asource
 of  capital  for  the Regulated  Businesses,  therefore,  parent  company  is  not  able  to  recover  the  interest  charges  on  its  debt  through  regulated  water  andwastewater
 rates. As of December  31, 2019,  AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the Regulated Businesses  amounting  to$4.8
 billion and $675  million,  respectively. Additionally, as of December  31, 2019,  AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans toparent
 company amounting $2.4  billion and $111  million,  respectively. As of December  31, 2019,  parent company has made long-term fixed rate loans to theMarket-Based Businesses
 amounting to $183 million  related to the acquis ition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018 . 62

Table of ContentsOn 
May 13, 2019,  AWCC completed a $1.10 billion  senior  unsecured debt offering which included the sale of $550 million  aggregate  principal amount ofits 
3.45% Senior Notes due 2029  and $550 million  aggregate principal amount of its 4.15%  Senior Notes due 2049 . At the closing of the offer ing, AWCC received,after deduction
 of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.09 billion . AWCC used the net proceeds to: (i)
 lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) repay $25  million principal  amount of AWCC’s 7.21%  Series  I Senior Notes at maturity onMay
 19,  2019;  (iii)  repay $26  million aggregate  principal  amount  of  subsidiary  debt  at  maturity  during  the  second  quarter  of  2019;  and  (iv)  repay  AWCC’scommercial paper ob
ligations, and for general corporate purposes.On 
May 6, 2019,  the Company terminated five  forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $510 million ,  realizing a net lossof 
$30 million,  to be amortized through interest, net over 10  and 30  year periods, in accordance with the terms of the new debt issued on May 13, 2019. Noineffectiveness was re
cognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.During 2019,
 AWCC and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also issued tax-exempt bonds at various dates with a total principal amount of $417 millionand
 a  weighted  average  interest  rate  of  2.5%.  The  bonds  are  scheduled  to  mature  in  2039  and  contain  optional  or  mandatory  redemption  dates  in  2029.  Theproceeds from these bonds were us
ed to repay $417 million of tax-exempt bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% and original maturities in 2039.One
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows riskmanagement
 policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managingcommercial
 paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. Thederivative
 contracts  entered  into  are  for  periods  consistent  with  the  related  underlying  exposures.  The  Company  is  exposed  to  the  risk  that  counterparties  toderivative
 contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by only dealing withleading, credit-worthy f
inancial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.In
 May 2018, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needsthrough
 the  offer  and  sale  to  the  public  from  time  to  time  of  an  unlimited  amount  of  various  types  of  securities,  including  American  Water  common  stock,preferred
 stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, andas
 applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in May 2021. During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , $1.10 billion, $1.33 billion,  and $1.35 billion , respectively, of debt securities
 were issued pursuant to this and the Company’s predecessor registration statement. Additionally, during 2018 under this registrationstatement, the Company issued 2.32 
million shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $183 million . Presented in the table be

 February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued through theCompany’s dividend reinvestment
, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares
 of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Theprogram
 is  conducted  in  accordance  with  Rule  10b-18  of  the  Exchange  Act,  and,  to  facilitate  these  repurchases,  the  Company  enters  into  Rule  10b5-1  stockrepurchase plans with a thi
rd-party broker, which allow the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented fromdoing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed tradin

AWCC
 has an unsecured revolving credit facility of $2.25 billion  that  expires in March 2024. In April 2019, AWCC and its lenders agreed to extend thetermination
 date  of  the  credit  agreement  with  respect  to  AWCC’s  revolving  credit  facility  pursuant  to  its  terms  from  March  2023  to  March  2024.  Subject  tosatisfying
 certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million
, and to request extensions of i ts expiration date for up to two, one-year periods, as to which one such extension request remains.Interest
 rates  on  advances  under  the  facility  are  based  on  a  credit  spread  to  the  LIBOR  rate  (or  applicable  market  replacement  rate)  or  base  rate  inaccordance
 with  Moody  Investors  Service’s  and  Standard  &  Poor’s  Financial  Services’  then  applicable  credit  rating  on  AWCC’s  senior  unsecured,  non-creditenhanced
 debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million  in  letters of credit. Indebtednessunder
 the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of aguarantee by parent comp
any of AWCC’s payment obligations under the credit facility.In March 2018, AWCC increased the max
imum aggregate outstanding amount under its commercial paper program from $1.60 billion  to $2.10 billion. Presented
 in the table below is the aggregate credit facility commitments, letter of credit sublimit under the revolving credit facility and commercial paperlimit, as well as the availa

The
 Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants,an
 event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company or its subsidiaries may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue newdebt or
 access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Companyfrom
 issuing  debt  secured  by  the  Company’s  assets,  subject  to  certain  exceptions.  Failure  to  comply  with  any  of  these  covenants  could  accelerate  repaymentobligations.
Covenants
 in  certain  long-term  notes  and  the  revolving  credit  facility  require  the  Company  to  maintain  a  ratio  of  consolidated  debt  to  consolidatedcapitalization (as
 defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2019 , the Company’s ratio was 0.61  to 1.00 and therefore theCompany was in compliance with the 
covenants.Security Ratings
Presented
 in  the  table  below  are  long-term  and  short-term  credit  ratings  and  rating  outlooks  as  of February  18, 2020 as  issued  by  the  following  ratingagencies:

 Moody’s InvestorsService
 Standard & Poor’sRatings Service
Rating Outlook
 Stable  Stable Senior unsecured debt
 Baa1  A Commercial paper
 P-2  A-1 On June 7, 2019, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service a
ffirmed the Company’s long-term ‘A’ and short-term ‘A-1’ credit ratings, with a stable outlook.On April 1, 2019, Moody’s Investors Service changed the
 Company’s senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1, from A3, with a stable outlook. The Company’scommercial paper 
rating remained unchanged.A
 security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning ratingagency,
 and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in anamount sufficient to se
rvice debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintainits
 existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although sucha downgrading could increase f
ees and interest charges under its credit facility.65

Table of ContentsAs
 part  of  its  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  routinely  enters  into  contracts  for  the  purchase  and  sale  of  water,  energy,  chemicals  and  otherservices.
 These  contracts  either  contain  express  provisions  or  otherwise  permit  the  Company  and  its  counterparties  to  demand  adequate  assurance  of  futureperformance
 when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by acredit rating agency, 
especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgradeas a basis for making a dem
and for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure itsobligations.
 The Company does not expect to post any collateral  which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financialposition or cash flows.
Access
 to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by theCompany’s
 securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, theCompany has
 also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lowerthe overall cost of debt.
Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions
For
 discussion  of  the  Company’s  dividends,  dividend  restrictions  and  dividend  policy,  see Note  9—Shareholders’ Equity in  the  Notes  to  ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for a
dditional information.Insurance Coverage
The Company
 carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistentwith
 industry  standards.  However,  insurance  coverage  may  not  be  adequate  or  available  to  cover  unanticipated  losses  or  claims.  Additionally,  annual  policyrenewals
 can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured tothe
 extent  that  losses are  within the policy  deductible  or exceed  the amount  of insurance  maintained.  Such losses  could have a material  adverse  effect  on theCompany’s short-term and long-
term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.Contractual Obligations and Commitments

Table of ContentsPerformance Obligations
The
 Company has entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and othercustomers.
 These obligations are not included in the table above. For discussion of the Company’s performance obligations see Note  3—Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financia
l Statements for additional information.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions andjudgments
 that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptionsand
 judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimatesand
 assumptions  in  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain  and  that  may  change  in  subsequent  periods.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the  estimates,  assumptions  andjudgments
 applied to these accounting policies  could have a significant  impact on the Company’s financial  condition, results of operations  and cash flows, asreflected
 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Company’sAudit,
 Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these criticalaccounting policies and th
eir application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Polic ies in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements.Regulation and Regulatory Accounting
The
 Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required forrate
 regulated  utilities,  which  requires  the  Company  to  reflect  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Use  of  this  authoritativeguidance is applicable
 to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumptionthat
 rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December  31, 2019,  the Companyconcluded that the opera
tions of its utilities met the criteria.Application of
 this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemakingprocess.
 The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, butare
 not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and otherdifferences
 in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulatedentity,
 to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of aregulatory
 liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and arerefundable to customers.
For
 each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatoryassets
 continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  recovery  and  regulatory  liabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  Thisassessment
 includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specificor
 similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate thatthe regulatory
 assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s Consolidated Statements ofOperations
 and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business nolonger
 meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include theelimination
 of  any  or  all  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  that  had  been  recorded  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Failure  to  meet  the  criteria  of  thisauthoritative guidanc
e could materially impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On 
December 22, 2017,  the  TCJA was  signed  into  law,  which,  among  other  things,  enacted  significant  and  complex  changes  to  the  Code,  including  areduction
 in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%  to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significant excess deferred incometaxes
 that the Company and its regulatory jurisdictions  believe should be refunded to customers. As such, the Company recorded  these amounts as regulatoryliabilities.
As
 of December  31, 2019 and 2018 ,  the Company’s regulatory asset balance was $1.1  billion and $1.2  billion,  respectively, and its regulatory liabilitybalance was 
$1.8 billion  and $1.9 billion , respectively. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabili ties in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements for furtherinformation regarding the 
Company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities.67

Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated  primarily  from water and wastewater  services  delivered  to customers.  These contractscontain
 a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separatelyidentifiable
 from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  aregenerally
 no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amountscalculated
 based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amountsthat
 the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the valuetransferred to the customer.
Increases
 or decreases  in the volumes  delivered  to  customers  and rate  mix due  to changes  in usage patterns  in customer  classes  in the  period  could besignificant to the ca
lculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled foreach
 meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31, 2019
 and 2018  was $142 million  and $144 million , respectively. The
 Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited tocustomers will occur through 
the ratemaking process.Revenue
 from the Company’s Homeowner  Services  Group is  generated  through various protection programs in which the Company provides fixed feeservices
 to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and external water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating andcooling
 systems,  water  heaters,  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  Most  of  the  contracts  have  a  one-year  term  and  each  service  is  a  separateperformance
 obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligatedto
 pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services. Advancesfrom customers are deferred u
ntil the performance obligation is satisfied.The
 Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various militaryinstallations
 and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, and prior to the sale of Keystone, the Company had shorter-term contracts that providedcustomized
 water transfer services for shale natural gas companies and customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably overthe term of the contr
act, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Companyto
 make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, wherebystand-alone,
 fixed  pricing  is  separately  stated  for  each  improvement.  The  Company  has  determined  that  these  capital  improvements  are  separate  performanceobligations, with
 revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during theperiod
 in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recordedas
 unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performanceand
 related  estimated  contract  profitability  may  result  in  revisions  to  costs  and  revenues,  and  are  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  revisions  are  determined.Unbilled revenue for the 
Market-Based Businesses  as of December 31, 2019  and 2018  was $30 million  and $42 million , respectively. Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant
 management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken,as well as deferred tax 
assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.In
 accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with atwo-step
 approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greaterthan
 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technicalmerits,
 no  benefit  is  recorded.  Uncertain  tax  positions  that  relate  only  to  timing  of  when  an  item  is  included  on  a  tax  return  are  considered  to  have  met  therecognition
 threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the positionwill
 be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognitionthreshold has been met and, i
f so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.The
 Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and abilityto
 implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those inthe
 form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferredtax assets when it concludes th
at it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.68

Table of ContentsUnder
 GAAP,  specifically  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  740, Income  Taxes (“ASC  740”),  the  tax  effects  of  changes  in  tax  laws  must  berecognized
 in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected toapply
 when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured basedupon
 the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and maybe
 subject to refund to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustmentto earnings.
Actual
 income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Company’sforecasted
 financial  condition  and results  of operations,  failure  to successfully  implement  tax planning  strategies  and recovery  of taxes  through the regulatoryprocess
 for the Regulated  Businesses,  as  well as  results  of  audits  and examinations  of  filed  tax  returns  by taxing  authorities.  The  resulting  tax balances  as  ofDecember
 31, 2019 and 2018  are  appropriately  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  authoritative  guidance;  however,  the  ultimate  outcome  of  taxmatters
 could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note  14—Income Taxes
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits
The
 Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations.See 
Note 15—Employee Benefits in  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for thedefined benefit pension pl
ans and postretirement benefit plans.The Company’s pension and postretirement
 benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions providedby
 the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension andpostretirement
 benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected torepresent
 the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overalleconomy.
 These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptionsare:
•
Discount Rate—The  discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be madein
 the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio ofhigh-quality debt instrum
ents, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.•
Expected  Return  on  Plan  Assets  (“EROA”)—Management  projects  the  future  return  on  plan  assets  considering  prior  performance,  but  primarilybased
 upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefitcosts the Company records curr
ently.•
Rate  of  Compensation  Increase—Management  projects  employees’  pay  increases,  which  are  used  to  project  employees’  pension  benefits  atretirement.
•
Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Manage ment projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.•
Mortality—Management  retained the Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality base table, which provides rates of mortality in 2006, but adopted thenew MP-2018 mortality improvem
ent scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2006.The discount rate assumption, which is
 determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistentwith
 changes  in  applicable  high-quality,  long-term  corporate  bond  indices.  The  Company  uses  an  approach  that  approximates  the  process  of  settlement  ofobligations
 tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selectedbonds.
 For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with theprojected
 benefit payments. The discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 3.44% , 4.38% and 3.75%  at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
 The  discount  rate  for  determining  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  was 3.36% , 4.32% and 3.73%  at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
In
 selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans.The
 long-term  EROA  assumption  used  in  calculating  pension  cost  was 6.20%  for 2019 , 5.95% for 2018 ,  and 6.49%  for 2017 .  The  weighted  average  EROAassumption used in calcula
ting other postretirement benefit costs was 3.56%  for 2019, 4.77% for 2018 and 5.09%  for 2017. 69

ing Plan ChangesOn 
July 31, 2018,  a new, five -year national benefits agreement was ratified, covering approximately 3,200  of  the Company’s union-represented employees.Most
 of the benefits under this new agreement became effective on January 1, 2019, and include, among other things, union-represented employees’ participationin
 the  Company’s  cash-based  annual  performance  plan,  additional  medical  plan  options  and  changes  to  certain  retiree  medical  benefits,  which  required  theCompany to remeasure its oth
er postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018.For
 those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65, the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a Health ReimbursementArrangement
 (“HRA”) similar to the cap currently in place for non-union retirees. The Company is providing a subsidy allowing the post-65 retirees to purchase aMedicare
 supplemental plan on a private exchange network. The pre-65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed tolimit
 the employer costs to 2018 levels. For pre-65 union members retiring early in 2019-2021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of thecap.
On 
August 31, 2018,  the  Postretirement  Medical  Benefit  Plan  was  remeasured  to  reflect  this  plan  change.  The  plan  change  resulted  in  a $175  millionreduction
 in future benefits payable to plan participants,  and, in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement  date, resulted in a $227 million
 reduction  to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The plan amendment will be amortized over 10.2  years, the average future workinglifetime to full eligibility age for
 all plan participants.After
 the remeasurement, the Retirement and Benefit Plans Investment Committee (the “Investment Committee”), which is responsible for overseeing theinvestment
 of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, determined that the funded status of the Postretirement Medical BargainingPlan was in excess of that needed 
to pay current and future benefits.Given the change in funded status 
in 2018, the Investment Committee commissioned an asset-liability study for the Postretirement Medical Bargaining Plan.This
 study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the investment risk in the plan due to its current funded status. The study also recommended reducing itsexposure
 to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability. The InvestmentCommittee
 approved the recommendations. Plan assets in excess of those securities designed to match the long-term liabilities are invested in shorter durationfixed income securit
ies and equities.Presented in the table be

 selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2018, theCompany’s health care
 cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 6.75%  in 2019 gradually declining to 5.00%  in 2026 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2019
, the Company is projecting tha t medical inflation will be 6.50% in 2020 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter.The
 Company will use a discount rate and EROA of 3.44%  and 6.50% ,  respectively, for estimating its 2020  pension  costs. Additionally, the Company willuse
 a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 3.36%  and 3.68% ,  respectively, for estimating its 2020  other  postretirement benefitcosts.
 A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Company’s pension expense. The Company’s 2019  and 2018  pension  and postretirementbenefit
 costs were $17 million  and $21 million ,  respectively. The Company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of$38
 million in 2020,  and $33  million, $34 million, $34 million and $32  million in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 ,  respectively. Actual amounts contributed couldchange
 significantly  from  these  estimates.  The  assumptions  are  reviewed  annually  and  at  any  interim  re-measurement  of  the  plan  obligations.  The  impact  ofassumption
 changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicableaccounting standards.
Accounting for Contingencies
The
 Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount ofthe
 loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about thelikely
 outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause thesejudgments or estimates 
to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: thenature
 of the litigation, claim  or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience  gained fromsimilar cases or situ
ations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or anadditional
 loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as asingle amount or within a re
asonable range.Actual
 amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have asignificant
 impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note  16—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financia
l Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.New Accounting Standards
See 
Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements for a description of recent accounting standards.ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCL OSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe
 Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risksfrom
 changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure bylimiting
 its  variable  rate  exposure  and  by  monitoring  the  effects  of  market  changes  in  interest  rates.  The  Company  also  has  the  ability  to  enter  into  financialderivative
 instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lockagreements
 to  manage  and  mitigate  interest  rate  risk  exposure.  As  of December  31, 2019,  a  hypothetical  increase  of  interest  rates  by 1%  associated  with  theCompany’s short-term borrowings would r
esult in a $7 million  increase in short-te rm interest expense.The Company’s
 risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and theexpected
 ability to recover price increases through rates, in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each regulatoryjurisdiction.
 Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position andcash flows.
The
 market price of the Company’s common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to its operating performance. In particular, theCompany’s
 stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. Thesecould
 include,  among  other  things,  interest  rate  movements,  quarterly  variations  or  changes  in  financial  estimates  by  securities  analysts  and  governmental  orregulatory
 actions. This volatility may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its commonstock or other equity securities, regardless
 of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of certainbusiness opportunities or mee
t business obligations.71

Table of ContentsThe
 Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and other water-related services provided by the Regulated  Businesses and Market- Based Businesses
. The Company’s Regulated Businesses  serve residential,  commercial, industrial and other customers, while the Market-Based Businesses  engage in
 business activities with developers, government entities and other customers. The Company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractualobligations
 and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. The Company’s credit risk is managedthrough
 established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposureand
 the  use  of  credit  risk  mitigation  measures  such  as  letters  of  credit  or  prepayment  arrangements.  The  Company’s  credit  portfolio  is  diversified  with  nosignificant
 customer  or  industry  concentrations.  In  addition,  the Regulated  Businesses are  generally  able  to  recover  all  prudently  incurred  costs  includinguncollectible custom
er accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates.The Company’s retirement trust assets are
 exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impactthe
 Company’s  pension  and  other  benefits  expense,  funded  status  and  future  minimum  funding  requirements.  Changes  in  interest  rates  can  impact  retirementliabilities.
 The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar tothat
 of  its  pension  liabilities,  seeking  to  hedge  some  of  the  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  its  liabilities.  That  way,  if  interest  rates  fall  and  liabilities  increase,  theCompany expects
 that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be reduced through its abilityto recover pension and other b
enefit costs through rates.The
 Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates.The
 credit quality of the Company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorableeconomic
 cycles  and  other  market  changes.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  regulators  will  grant  sufficient  rate  authorizations.  Therefore,  theCompany’s
 ability  to  fully  recover  operating  expense,  recover  its  investment  and  provide  an  appropriate  return  on  invested  capital  made  in  the Regulated Businesses
 may be adversely impacted. 72

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareho
lders ofAmerican Water Works Comp
any, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We
 have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries (the  “Company”)  as  ofDecember
 31, 2019 and 2018 ,  and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows foreach
 of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 ,  including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). Wealso
 have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2019,  based on criteria established in Internal  Control - IntegratedFramework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as ofDecember 31, 2019
 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019  in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiveinternal
 control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2019,  based on criteria established in Internal  Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by theCOSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note
 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.Basis for Opinions
The
 Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,and
 for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  FinancialReporting
 appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internalcontrol
 over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates)
 (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about  whether  the consolidated financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated
 financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements,
 whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding
 the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates
 made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting
 included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  andevaluating
 the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in th
e circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor
tingA
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand
 the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.74

Table of ContentsBecause
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters
The
 critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  wascommunicated
 or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financialstatements
 and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any wayour
 opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separateopinion on the critical 
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Accounting for the Effects o
f Rate RegulationAs
 described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,128 million
 and  $1,806  million,  respectively,  as  of December  31,  2019.  The  Company’s  regulated  utilities  are  subject  to  regulation  by  multiple  state  utilitycommissions
 and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to bereflected in the Company
’s consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business,management
 assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatoryliabilities
 continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  This  assessment  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  changes  in  regulatoryenvironments, recent
 rate orders, including  recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdictions,and the status of any pending or pot
ential legislation.The
 principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  accounting  for  the effects  of  rate  regulation  is a  critical  auditmatter
 are there was significant judgment by management related to the accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, including assessing whether the regulatoryassets
 continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement as a result ofchanges
 in regulatory environments, recent rate orders, including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities inthe
 same  jurisdictions,  and  the status  of  any  pending or  potential  legislation.  This  in  turn led  to  a high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity,  and effort  inperforming audit procedure
s and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to management’s judgments.Addressing
 the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidatedfinancial
 statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s regulatory accounting process, including controlsover
 management’s assessment and consideration of factors related to the probability of future recovery or settlement. These procedures also included, amongothers,
 evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Company’s correspondencewith
 regulators,  status  of  regulatory  proceedings,  past  practices,  recent  rate  orders  on  specific  or  similar  incurred  cost  to  other  regulated  entities  in  the  samejurisdictions, and
 other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and disclosure implications; and evaluating regulatory assets and liabilities balancesbased on provisions and formulas out
lined in rate orders and other correspondence with the Company’s regulators./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Table of ContentsAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unless otherwise noted, in mil
lions, except per share data)Note 1: Organization and Operation
American
 Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “American  Water”)  is  a  holding  company  for  regulated  and  market-based  subsidiariesthroughout
 the United States. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries. The Company’s primarybusiness
 involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 16  states in the United States, collectively referred to as the“
Regulated Businesses.”  The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary water and wastewater services within non-reportableoperating
 segments,  collectively  referred  to  as  the  “Market-Based  Businesses.”  The  Company’s  primary Market-Based  Businesses include  the Homeowner Services Group
,  which provides various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers; and the Military  Services Group, which enters into long-term 
contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations.Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies
Regulation
The
 Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectivelyreferred
 to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, whichrequires
 the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended torecover
 the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may also approve accounting treatments, long-termfinancing
 programs  and  cost  of  capital,  operation  and  maintenance  (“O&M”)  expenses,  capital  expenditures,  taxes,  affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,reorganizations, mergers,
 acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences inthe
 collection of a regulated utility’s revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated
 entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require thecreation
 of  a  regulatory  liability  for  amounts  collected  in  rates  to  recover  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  in  the  future,  or  amounts  collected  in  excess  of  costsincurred and are refund
able to customers. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabili ties for additional information. Use of Estimates
The
 preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  (“GAAP”)  requires  thatmanagement
 make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual resultscould
 differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatoryaccounting
 principles  and  the  related  determination  and  estimation  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  (ii)  revenue  recognition  and  the  estimates  used  in  thecalculation
 of  unbilled  revenue,  (iii)  accounting  for  income  taxes,  (iv)  benefit  plan  assumptions  and  (v)  the  estimates  and  judgments  used  in  determining  losscontingencies. The Company’s critical
 accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets andliabilities, incom
e taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.Principles of Consolidation
The
 accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest ismaintained after the elimination of
 intercompany balances and transactions.Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement ofretirement
 units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering andsupervision, transportation
 and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged toO&M expense as incurred.
The cost of utility pla
nt is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation inconformity
 with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’ remaininguseful lives.
Nonutility
 property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Company’s Market-Based  Businesses and  for internal operations. Thisproperty is stated at cos
t, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.82

Table of ContentsWhen
 units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulateddepreciation.
 To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory assetis
 recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. Theseamounts
 result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets areincurred.
The
 costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of thesecosts amounted to 
$345 million  and $336 million  as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds
Substantially
 all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased areconsidered to be cash equiva
lents.Restricted
 funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future servicesunder O&M
 projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on theConsolidated Balance Sheets as e
ither current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.Presented
 in the table below is a reconciliation of the cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds amounts as presented on the Consolidated BalanceSheets to the sum of such amounts pr
esented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31 :

ther long-term assets—  1 Cash and cash equivalents and res
tricted funds as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows$ 91  $159 Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues
Accounts receivable
 include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally ona
 monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based tradeaccounts
 receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has notbeen billed to customers 
and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Allowances
 for  uncollectible  accounts  are  maintained  for  estimated  probable  losses  resulting  from  the  Company’s  inability  to  collect  receivables  fromcustomers.
 Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowancefor
 uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due and previous loss history. The Company generally writes off accounts when theybecome
 uncollectible or reserves accounts that exceed a certain number of days outstanding. See Note  6—Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for  additionalinformation.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies a
re stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.Leases
The Company has operating and finan
ce leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company determinesif
 an  arrangement  is  a  lease  at  inception.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  operating  lease  right-of-use  (“ROU”)  assets,  accrued  liabilities  and  operating  leaseliabilities
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities onthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. Th
e Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.83


Table of ContentsROU
 assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arisingfrom
 the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease payments overthe
 lease  term.  As  most  of  the  Company’s  leases  do  not  provide  an  implicit  rate,  the  Company  uses  its  incremental  borrowing  rate  based  on  the  informationavailable
 at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. ROUassets
 also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the leasewhen it is reasonably cert
ain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The
 Company  has  lease  agreements  with  lease  components  (e.g.,  fixed  payments  including  rent,  real  estate  taxes  and  insurance  costs)  and  non-leasecomponents
 (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-leasecomponents
 as  a  single  lease  component  for  certain  leases.  Certain  lease  agreements  include  variable  rental  payments  adjusted  periodically  for  inflation.Additionally,
 the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do notcontain any material residual 
value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.Goodwill
Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of abusiness.
 Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested forimpairment
 at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reportingunit below its carrying valu
e.The
 Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with (i) the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003, (ii)the
 acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to the Company’s previous owner in 2001, and (iii) the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions (“Pivotal”)in
 2018; and has been allocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, thereporting
 units in the Regulated  Businesses segment  are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The Market-Based  Businesses is  comprised of the Homeowner Services Group
 and Military Services Group  reporting units. The
 Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November  30 of  each year, in conjunction with the completion of the Company’s annualbusiness
 plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors,that
 the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses thequalitative
 assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than itscarrying
 value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respectivenet
 carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’scarrying value compared to
 its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Application
 of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value ofreporting
 units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, butare not limited to, fo
recasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates.The
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from theassumptions and
 considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 for additional information. Intangible Assets
Intangible
 assets consist primarily of finite-lived customer relationships associated with the acquisition of Pivotal. Finite-lived intangible assets are initiallymeasured
 at their estimated fair values, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangibleassets are consumed or othe
rwise used. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  for additional information. 84

Table of ContentsImpairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
 assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assetsfor
 impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the Company estimates the fairvalue of
 the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimatedfair
 value to the carrying value of the asset. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the long-lived asset’s carrying valuecompared to its estim
ated fair value.The
 long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wideoperations that
 do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery inrates of that asset is no 
longer probable.The Company holds other long-term
 investments in privately held companies and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, and are classified asother
 long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of the long-term investments is dependent on the financial performance andsolvency of the entities in
 which the Company invests, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. If such long-term investments are considered impaired,an impairment loss will b
e recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the investment’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.The
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differsfrom the assumptions and
 considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction
Regulated
 utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estatedevelopers to fund construct
ion necessary to extend service to new areas.Advances
 are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included inother current
 liabilities as of December 31, 2019  and 2018  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $25 million  and $23 million , respectively. Those amounts represent expe
cted refunds during the next 12-month period.Advances
 that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions. Contributions are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particularconstruction
 project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds.
Generally,
 the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense,producing
 a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatoryguidelines,
 some of  the Company’s utility  subsidiaries  do  not amortize  contributions,  and any  contribution  received  remains  on the  balance  sheet  indefinitely.Amortization
 of  contributions  in  aid  of  construction  was $29  million, $28  million and $27  million for  the  years  ended December  31,  2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
Revenue Recognition
On
 January  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  606, Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers, and  all  relatedamendments
 (collectively, “ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective approach, applied to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Underthis approach, periods prior 
to the adoption date have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.Under ASC
 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to acustomer.
 Revenue  is  recognized  when  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  promised  goods  or  services.  The  amount  ofrevenue
 recognized  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange  for  goods  or  services.  Under  ASC  606,  acontract’s
 transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determinesare
 within  the  scope  of  ASC  606,  the  Company  performs  the  following  five  steps:  (i)  identifies  the  contracts  with  a  customer;  (ii)  identifies  the  performanceobligations
 within  the  contract,  including  whether  any  performance  obligations  are  distinct  and  capable  of  being  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  contract;  (iii)determines
 the transaction price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizes revenue when, or as, theCompany satisfies each per
formance obligation.85

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days  of  billingand
 none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year ;  therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing componentpractical expedien
t and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.Regulated Businesses Revenue
Revenue
 from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated  primarily  from water and wastewater  services  delivered  to customers.  These contractscontain a
 single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separatelyidentifiable
 from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  aregenerally
 no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amountscalculated
 based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amountsthat
 the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the valuetransferred to the customer. The
 Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are tobe credited to custome
rs will occur through the ratemaking process.Market-Based Businesses Revenue
Through
 various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company provides fixed fee services to residential customers for interior andexterior
 water  and  sewer  lines,  interior  electric  and  gas  lines,  heating  and  cooling  systems,  water  heaters  and  other  home  appliances,  as  well  as  power  surgeprotection
 and other related services. Most of the contracts have a one-year term and each service is a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as thecustomers
 simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months
 or  via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services. Advances from customers are deferred until the performanceobligation is satisfied.
The
 Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various militaryinstallations
 and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, and prior to the sale of Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC (“Keystone”), the Companyhad
 shorter-term contracts that provided customized water transfer services for shale natural gas companies and customers. Billing and revenue recognition for thefixed
 fee  revenues  occurs  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  contract,  as  customers  simultaneously  receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  Company.Additionally,
 these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications oramendments to
 the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capitalimprovements
 are  separate  performance  obligations,  with  revenue  recognized  over  time  based  on  performance  completed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.Losses
 on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess ofbillings
 on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognitioncriteria
 are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues, and are recognized inthe period in which revisions a
re determined. See Note 3—Revenue Recognition  for additional information. Income Taxes
The
 Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group arecharged with the amou
nt of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.Certain
 income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Companyprovides
 deferred  income  taxes  on  the  difference  between  the  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  amounts  at  which  they  are  carried  in  the  financialstatements.
 These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. Inaddition,
 the  regulated  utility  subsidiaries  recognize  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  effect  on  revenues  expected  to  be  realized  as  the  tax  effects  oftemporary differen
ces, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.Investment tax
 credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives ofthe related assets.
The
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collectedfrom customers and rem
itted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 14—Income Taxes  for additional information. 86

Table of ContentsAllowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC
 is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity fundsdevoted
 to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable toborrowed
 funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds wouldbe included in other, net on th
e Consolidated Statements of Operations. Presented in the table below is AFUDC for the years ended December 31 :  
2019  2018  2017 Allowance for other funds used during 
construction$ 28  $24  $19 Allowance for borrowed funds used during cons
truction13  13  8 Environmental Costs
The
 Company’s water and wastewater operations and the operations of its Market-Based  Businesses are  subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreignrequirements
 relating  to  environmental  protection,  and  as  such,  the  Company  periodically  becomes  subject  to  environmental  claims  in  the  normal  course  ofbusiness. Environmental expenditures that
 relate to current operations or provide a future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs thatrelate
 to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can bereasonably
 estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010and
 amended in 2017 required the subsidiary to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the CarmelRiver
 watershed in the State of California. The subsidiary agreed to pay $1  million annually  commencing in 2010 with the final payment being made in 2021.Remediation costs accru
ed amounted to $2 million  and $4 million  as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are enteredinto
 for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter intoderivative contrac
ts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.All
 derivatives  are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  On  the  date  the  derivative  contract  is  entered  into,  the  Company  may  designate  thederivative as a hedge of the fair
 value of a recognized asset or liability (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows tobe received or paid related t
o a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlyi
ng hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gainsand
 losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.Any ineffective portion of d
esignated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.Cash flows from derivative con
tracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 11— Long-Term Debt
 for additional information. 87

Accounting for
Leases 
 
Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for leasingarrangements. Under this guidance, a lessee is required to recognize
the following for all leases, excluding short-term leases, at the
commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which 
is a lessee’s obligationto make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that
represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. A package of optional transition practical
expedients allows an entity not to reassess under the new guidance: (i)
whether any expired or existing contracts as of the adoption date are
or contain leases; (ii) lease classification; and (iii) ini
tial direct costs.Additional, optional transition practical expedien
ts are available whichallow an entity not to evaluate expired or existing land easemen
ts as ofthe adoption date if the easements were not previously accounted for
as leases; and to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and
recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment in the opening balance of
retained earnings in the period of adoption.

eligible for hedge accounting. Under this guidance, a qualitative
effectiveness assessment is permitted for certain hedges if an entity
can reasonably support an expectation of high effectiveness
throughout the term of the hedge, provided that an initial quanti
tativetest establishes that the hedge relationship is h
ighly effective. Also, forcash flow hedges determined to be highly effective, all changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument will be recorded in other
comprehensive income, with a subsequent reclassification to earnings
when the hedged item impacts earnings.

taxesin an interim period when the year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated
loss. The guidance adds requirements to reflect changes to tax laws or
rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interi

similar taxes that are partially based on income as an income-based
tax and any incremental amounts as non-income-based tax, and to
evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be
considered part of the business combination in which the book

Contract Balances
Contract
 assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In the Company’sMarket-Based
 Businesses, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or uponachievement
 of  contractual  milestones.  Contract  assets  are  recorded  when  billing  occurs  subsequent  to  revenue  recognition  and  are  reclassified  to  accountsreceivable
 when  billed  and  the  right  to  consideration  becomes  unconditional.  Contract  liabilities  are  recorded  when  the  Company  receives  advances  fromcustomers
 prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts and home warranty protection program contracts, and arerecognized
 as  revenue  when  the  associated  performance  obligations  are  satisfied.  Contract  assets  are  included  in  unbilled  revenues  and  contract  liabilities  areincluded in other curren
t liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 . 90

These  regulatory assets are related to the pending transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and are included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated BalanceSheets. See 
Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures  for additional information. The
 Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $375 million
 and $352 million  as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively. The  remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to thepension plans which is deferred by 
certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan.Removal costs recoverabl
e through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.Regulatory
 balancing  accounts  accumulate  differences  between  revenues  recognized  and  authorized  revenue  requirements  until  they  are  collected  fromcustomers or are refund
ed. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs and purchased power and water accounts.Other
 regulatory assets include San Clemente Dam project costs, debt expense, purchase premium recoverable through rates, tank painting costs, certainconstruction
 costs  for  treatment  facilities,  property  tax  stabilization,  employee-related  costs,  deferred  other  postretirement  benefit  expense,  business  servicesproject
 expenses,  coastal  water  project  costs,  rate  case  expenditures  and  environmental  remediation  costs  among  others.  These  costs  are  deferred  because  theamounts are being recove
red in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.94

Regulatory
 liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate making process. Also, ifcosts

These  regulatory liabilities are related to the pending transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and are included in liabilities related to assets held for sale on theConsolidated Balance Sheets. See 
Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures  for additional information. Income
 taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December  22, 2017,  the TCJAwas
 signed  into  law,  which,  among  other  things,  enacted  significant  and  complex  changes  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986  (the  “Code”),  including  areduction
 in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%  to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significant excess deferred incometaxes
 that the Company and its regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers. Since these are significant refundable amounts, the Companybelieves it is probable 
these amounts will be refunded to customers through future rates, and as such the amounts have been recorded to a regulatory liability.During
 2018, the Company’s 14  regulatory jurisdictions began to seek to address the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates toreflect
 the lower income tax rate  in 11  states.  In one  of  those 11  states,  a  portion  of  the  tax  savings  is  being  used  to  reduce  certain  regulatory  assets.  In one additional
 state,  the  Company  is  using  the  tax  savings  to  offset  additional  capital  investment  and  to  reduce  a  regulatory  asset.  Proceedings  in  the  other two jurisdictions
 remain pending. With respect to excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”), six  of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are amortizingEADIT
 and crediting  customers,  including one  which  is  using  the  EADIT to  offset  future  infrastructure  investments.  The  Company  expects  the  timing  of  theamortization of EADIT cred
its by the eight  remaining regulated subs idiaries to be addressed in pending or future rate cases or other proceedings.Removal
 costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer ratesover the lives of the assoc
iated assets.On 
August 31, 2018,  the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certainunion
 and non-union plan participants. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a $227 million  reduction  to the net accumulated postretirementbenefit obligation, with a 
corresponding regulatory liability.Other
 regulatory  liabilities  include  TCJA  reserve  on  revenue,  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  balancing  accounts,  legal  settlement  proceeds,deferred gains and various 
regulatory balancing accounts.95

This  goodwill is related to the pending transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and is included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures
 for additional information. In 2019, the Company acquired goodwill of 
$3 million  associated with three  of its acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses  segment. Additionally, as par t ofthe
 sale  of  the  Company’s  Keystone  operations  on December  12,  2019,  the  Company  reduced  goodwill,  net,  by $38  million.  See Note  4—Acquisitions  andDivestitures
 for additional information. The
 Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November  30, 2019,  which included quantitative assessments of its Regulated Businesses
, Homeowner Services Group and Military  Services Group reporting  units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that there were nofactors present that would 
indicate that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values as of November 30 , 2019. In
 2018, the Company acquired goodwill of $247 million  associated  with its acquisition of Pivotal, which was allocated to the Homeowner Services Group reporting
 unit, within the Market-Based  Businesses.  Additionally,  the Company acquired  goodwill of $2  million associated  with one  of its  acquisitions  in theRegulated Businesses
 segment. During
 the third quarter of 2018, as a result of the narrowing the scope of the Company’s former Keystone operations, the Company concluded there wereindicators
 that the Keystone reporting unit may have been impaired. Accordingly, impairment testing was performed as part of the preparation of the Company’sConsolidated Financial
 Statements during the third quarter of 2018. The results of this impairment test showed the fair value of the former Keystone reporting unitwas
 lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $53 million .  Additionally, the impairment test showed the fairvalue
 of the former Keystone reporting unit’s customer relationship intangible asset was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax impairmentcharge of 
$4 million .  In the aggregate, a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $57 million  was  recorded in impairment charge on the Consolidated Statement ofOperations for the year end
ed December 31, 2018 , of which, $54 million  was attributable to the Comp any, after adjustment for noncontrolling interest.Intangible Assets

 Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to netincome in its entirety,
 as a portion of these costs have been capitalized as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are includedin the computation of net p
eriodic pension cost. See Note 15—Employee Benefits  for additional information. During
 the second quarter of 2019, the Company substantially exited its foreign operations in Canada due to a contract expiration in its Contract ServicesGroup. As a result, the
 Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $1 million  from cumulative  foreign currency translation, and a corresponding change of accumulatedother comprehensive loss.
The
 amortization  of  the  gain  (loss)  on  cash  flow  hedges  is  reclassified  to  net  income  during  the  period  incurred  and  is  included  in  interest,  net  in  theaccompanying Consolidated Stat
ements of Operations.Dividends
The
 Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to havingaccess
 to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness fromthe
 Company’s subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements, andother
 factors. The Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, amongother
 factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared,they are typically pa
id in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to thedistribution date. Since th
e dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.During 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company paid $353 million , $319 million and $289 million  in cash dividends, respectiv ely. Presented in the table below isthe per share cash dividends p

The issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by American Water Capital Corp
. (“AWCC”), the Company’s whollyowned financing
 subsidiary, does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. However, state PUCauthorization
 is  required  to  issue  long-term  debt  at  most  of  the  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries.  The  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries  normally  obtain  therequired approvals on a per
iodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing.Under
 applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at asubsidiary
 may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to American Water. Furthermore, the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay upstreamdividends
 or  repay  indebtedness  to  American  Water  is  subject  to  compliance  with  applicable  regulatory  restrictions  and  financial  obligations,  including,  forexample,
 debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations, and other agreements orcovenants made or enter
ed into by the Company and its subsidiaries.Note 10: Stock Based Compensation
The Company
 has granted stock options, stock units and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Companypursuant
 to the terms of its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Stock units under the 2007 Plan generally vest based on (i) continuedemployment
 with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in wholeor
 in part of stated performance-based goals (“PSUs”). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus Plan, as defined below, and no additional awardsmay
 be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued under that planprior to May 12, 2017.
In
 May  2017,  the  Company’s  shareholders  approved  the  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  2017  Omnibus  Equity  Compensation  Plan  (the  “2017Omnibus
 Plan”). The Company has granted stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers andemployees
 under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. A total of 7.2 million  shares  of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2019 , 6.8 million
 shares  were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the followingforms:
 incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.Dividend equivalents may be gr
anted only on stock units or other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027.The
 cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant datefair
 value of the awards issued. The value of stock options and stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite serviceperiod.
 All awards granted in 2019 , 2018 and 2017  are  classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vestingperiod of
 the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate iscompared
 to  the  actual  forfeitures  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  and  adjusted  as  necessary.  Presented  in  the  table  below  is  the  stock-based  compensationexpense recorded in O&M expense

Table of ContentsThe
 Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stockunits.
 For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company recognizes the tax benefits, which have been included in deferred income tax assets,related
 to  compensation  costs.  The  tax  deductions  in  excess  of  the  benefits  recorded  throughout  the  requisite  service  period  are  recorded  to  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Operations and 
are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Stock Options
There
 were no  grants of stock options to employees in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .  The stock options that were previously issued vested ratably over the three - year
 service period beginning on January 1 of the year of the grant and have no performance vesting conditions. Expense was recognized using the straight-linemethod and was amortized ove

During 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the  Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2007 Plan and 2017 Omnibus Plan, as applicable. RSUs generallyvest based on continued employm
ent with the Company over periods ranging from one  to three years. During 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the  Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in fullon
 the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30  days of  the earlier of (i) 15  months after  the date of the last annual meeting ofshareholders, subject to
 any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Because these stock units vested on the grant date, thetotal grant date fa

 RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a three -year service period. These RSUs are amortized 
through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.100

The
 Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (other thanthe
 Company’s executive officers) may use payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a discount of 85%  of the fair market value of the commonstock at
 the end of the purchase period. A total of 2.0 million  shares may  be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31, 2019 , there were 1.8 million  shares of common
 stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered compensatory. During the years ended December  31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 ,  theCompany issued 
88 thousand , 95 thousand and 93 thousand  shares, respectively, unde r the ESPP and its predecessor plan.Note 11: Long-Term Debt

Table of ContentsOne
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows riskmanagement
 policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managingcommercial
 paper and debt maturities. The Company also does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.The
 derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties toderivative
 contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions havinglong-term credit r
atings of “A” or better.On 
May 6, 2019,  AWCC terminated five  forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $510 million ,  realizing a net loss of $30 million
, to be amortized through in terest, net over 10  and 30  year periods, in accordance with the terms of the new debt issued on May 13, 2019. No ineffectivenesswas recognized on hedging instrum
ents for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.The Company has employed interest rate swaps to
 fix the interest cost on a portion of its variable-rate debt with an aggregate notional amount of $3 million . The
 Company  has  designated  these  instruments  as  economic  hedges,  accounted  for  at  fair  value,  with  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  interest,  net.  The  gainrecognized by the Company was de min

Short-term
 debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $786  million and $964  million as  of December  31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The weighted average interest rate
 on AWCC short-term borrowings was approximately 2.54%  and 2.28%  for the year ended December 31, 2019  and 2018
, respectively. As of December 31, 2019  there were no  borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.Liquidity
 needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are funded through cash flows from operations, public and privatedebt
 offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility and, in the future, issuances ofequity.
 The revolving credit facility provides $2.25 billion  in  aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. On April 9, 2019, thetermination date
 of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility was extended, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, from March21,
 2023 to March 21, 2024. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million  for letters
 of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. Subject tosatisfying
 certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million
,  and  to  request  up  to two  extensions  of  its  expiration  date  each  for  up  to  a  one-year  period,  as  to  which  one  such  extension  request  remains.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2019, AWCC had no  outstanding borrowings and $76 million  of  outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with $2.17 billion available
 to  fulfill  the  Company’s  short-term  liquidity  needs  and  to  issue  letters  of  credit.  The  Company  regularly  evaluates  the  capital  markets  and  closelymonitors
 the financial  condition of the financial  institutions  with contractual  commitments  in its revolving credit  facility.  Interest  rates on advances  under thefacility
 are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s andStandard & Poor’s Financial Servi
ces’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.Presented

 of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading couldincrease fees and int

 part of the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. Thesecontracts
 either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance whenthere
 are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency,especially
 if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis formaking
 a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on the Company’s net position with the counterparty, the demand could be for theposting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed provision

 be a function of the facts and circumstances of the Company’s situation at the time of the demand. If the Company can reasonably claim that it is willing andfinancially
 able to perform its obligations, it may be possible that no collateral would need to be posted or that only an amount equal to two  or three months of future
 payments should be sufficient. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results ofoperations, financial pos

December 22, 2017,  the  TCJA  was  signed  into  law.  Substantially  all  of  the  provisions  of  the  TCJA  are  effective  for  taxable  years  beginning  afterDecember
 31,  2017.  The  TCJA  includes  significant  changes  to  the  Code,  including  amendments  which  significantly  change  the  taxation  of  individuals  andbusiness entities, and
 includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Company included in the TCJAare
 reductions in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35%  to 21%, and several technical provisions including, among others, limiting the utilization of netoperating
 losses (“NOLs”) arising after December 31, 2017 to 80%  of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The specific provisions related to regulatedpublic utilities in the TCJA generally allow for the continued ded
uctibility of interest expense, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain propertyacquired after September 27, 2017 and the continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. Non-regulated segments of
the Company’s business may be able 
to take advantage of the full expensing provisions of the TCJA.Changes in the Code from the TCJA had a mat
erial impact on the Company’s financial statements in 2017. Under GAAP, specifically Accounting StandardsCodification
 Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC  740”), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740also
 requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized orsettled. Thus,
 at the date of enactment, the Company’s deferred income taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities,substantially
 all  of  the  change  in  deferred  income  taxes  are  recorded  as  an  offset  to  either  a  regulatory  asset  or  liability  because  changes  are  expected  to  berecovered
 by or refunded to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred income taxes is recorded as a non-cash re-measurementadjustment to earnings.
The
 staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the TCJA, and on December 22, 2017issued
 guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available orcomplete
 and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. The Company made a reasonable estimate for themeasurement
 and accounting of certain effects of the TCJA which were reflected in the financial statements as of December 31, 2017. The re-measurement ofdeferred
 income  taxes  at  the  new  federal  tax  rate  increased  the  2017  deferred  income  tax  provision  by $125  million for  the year ending December  31, 2017.Additionally,
 the  accumulated  deferred  income  tax  liability  decreased  by $1.39  billion and  regulatory  liabilities  increased  by $1.51  billion,  respectively,  as  ofDecember 31, 2017.
As
 of December 31, 2018, the Company recorded all its reasonable estimates resulting from the TCJA under SAB 118. These estimates, however, are stillsubject to changes due to the future impacts of various items, including further change
s in income tax laws, forecasted financial conditions and the actual tax returnfilings with the tax author
ities. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not identified any changes that would require its prior estimates to be modified.ASC
 740 requires the re-measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income.Adjusting
 temporary  differences  originally  recorded  to  AOCI  through  the  income  statement  result  in  disproportionate  tax  effects  remaining  in  AOCI.  As  ofDecember 31, 2018, the Company adopted Accoun
ting Standards Update 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax E ffects from Accumulated Other ComprehensiveIncome,
 which  allows  companies  to  reclassify  the  income  tax  effects  of  TCJA  on  items  within  AOCI  to  retained  earnings.  As  a  result  of  the  TCJA  tax  ratereduction,
 there  were  income  tax  effects  related  to  the  Company’s  hedge  and  pension  positions  of $2  million and $22  million,  respectively,  remaining  in  theCompany’s
 accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  balance.  The  Company  reclassified  these  tax  effects  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  toaccumulated defic
it as of December 31, 2018. No further adjustments were recorded during 2019 as a result of this re-measurement.106

 of December  31, 2019 and 2018 ,  the Company recognized federal NOL carryforwards of $673  million and $813  million,  respectively. The Companybelieves
 the federal NOL carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and require no valuation allowance. The Company expects to fully utilize itsfederal NOL carryforwards be
fore they begin to expire in 2028 . As
 of December  31, 2019 and 2018 ,  the  Company  had  state  NOLs  of $453  million and $387  million,  respectively,  a  portion  of  which  are  offset  by  avaluation
 allowance because the Company does not believe these NOLs are more likely than not to be realized. The  state NOL carryforwards began to expire in2019 through 2038
. The
 capital loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes have increased from the previous year due to the capital loss produced by the sale of theCompany’s
 Keystone operations. As of December  31, 2019,  the capital loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes was approximately $66 million .  As ofDecember 31, 2019
 and 2018 , the Company had an insignifican t amount of Canadian NOL carryforward.The
 Company  files  income  tax  returns  in  the  United  States  federal  jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  With  few  exceptions,  theCompany is
 no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or before 2012. The Company hasstate income tax exa

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The
 Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations.Benefits
 under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pensionplans
 were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groupsspecified in
 the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hiredon
 or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are provided with a 5.25%  of  base pay defined contribution plan. TheCompany
 does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provideadditional retirement benefits to
 certain employees.The Company’s pension
 funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct
 of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid “at risk”status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protectio
n Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financialrequirements and
 the plans’ funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiariespending
 future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note  7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for  additionalinformation.
 Pension  plan  assets  are  invested  in  a  number  of  actively  managed,  commingled  funds,  and  limited  partnerships  including  equities,  fixed  incomesecurities, guaranteed ann
uity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).The
 Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfareplans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 20
06. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002.The
 Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number ofactively managed and co
mmingled funds including equities and fixed income securities.The
 investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over along-term
 horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of theCompany’s securities are 
included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets.The
 Company  uses  fair  value  for  all  classes  of  assets  in  the  calculation  of  market-related  value  of  plan  assets.  As  of  2018,  the  fair  values  and  assetallocations of
 the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands WaterCompany, Inc. Pension Plan.

 Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and riskmitigation
 strategies  for  the  plans  are  tailored  specifically  for  each  trust.  In  setting  new  strategic  asset  mixes,  consideration  is  given  to  the  likelihood  that  theselected
 asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updatesthe
 long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  to  determine  the  optimal  asset  allocation.Considerations include plan l
iability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.In
 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over fundedpostretirement
 medical  benefits  bargaining  plan. Given the change in funded status,  the Retirement  and Benefit  Plans Investment  Committee  (the  “InvestmentCommittee”),
 which is responsible for overseeing the investment of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, commissioned a newasset-liability
 study for the postretirement medical bargaining plan. This study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the investment risk in the plan due to thecurrent
 funded status. The study also recommended reducing its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flowsfor future benefit payments
 of the liability. The Investment Committee approved the recommendations.The
 Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixedincome,
 equity,  alternatives)  or  strategy  for  which  they  have  been  appointed.  Investment  management  agreements  and  recurring  performance  and  attributionanalysis
 are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used toadjust portfolio duration 
to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.In order
 to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposedto interest rate
 risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities.Conversely,
 rate  decreases  will  increase  fixed  income  assets,  partially  offsetting  the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  byconstructing a
 portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the postretirementmedical bargaining pl
an, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plan’s exposure to changes in interest rates.Actual
 allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of timeit
 takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, ifnecessary.
 Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) Trust assets include the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan,the
 New York Water Service Corporation Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-BargainingPlan, and the American Wat
er Life Insurance Trust.110

Cash—Cash
 and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are consideredcash and are included in th
e recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.Equity
 securities—For  equity  securities,  the  trustees  obtain  prices  from  pricing  services,  whose  prices  are  obtained  from  direct  feeds  from  marketexchanges, that
 the Company is able to independently corroborate. Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized asLevel
 1. Other equities, such as international securities held in the pension plan, are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds arevalued
 to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly observable or not availableon
 a  nationally  recognized  securities  exchange  for  the  commingled  funds,  they  are  categorized  as  Level  2.  For  limited  partnerships,  the  assets  as  a  whole  arecategorized as Level 3 due to
 the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnershipvehicle cannot be read
ily traded.112

Table of ContentsFixed-income
 securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid
 and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bondsare
 based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because thevaluations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-tra
ded options and futures, for whichmarket
 quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they aretraded and are classi
fied as Level 1.Real estate fund—Real est
ate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle is inthe form of a limit
ed partnership.REITs—REITs
 are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since th
e net asset value is not directly observable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.Guaranteed annuity contracts—Guara
nteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these marketvalues
 are  determined  by  the provider,  they are  not highly  observable  and  have been  categorized  as  Level  3.  Exchange-traded  future  and option  positions  arereported in accordance wit

In
 2006, the PPA replaced the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring that defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of thecurrent
 liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk”and
 additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan year with short-term phase-in provisions for boththe
 funding  target  and  at-risk  determination.  The  Company’s  qualified  defined  benefit  plan  is  currently  funded  above  the  at-risk  threshold,  and  therefore  theCompany
 expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s fundedstatus and projected cont
ributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.Minimum
 funding  requirements  for  the  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  are  determined  by  government  regulations  and  not  by  accountingpronouncements.
 The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2020  to the qualified pension plans. Contribu
tions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances.Presented in the table be

 for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turno
ver and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. Theassumptions
 are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capitalmarkets and the overal
l economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.Presented in the table be

“N/A” in the table above means assumption is not applicable. The
 discount  rate  assumption  was  determined  for  the  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plans  independently.  The  Company  uses  an  approach  thatapproximates
 the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expectedmaturity values
 of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would produce the samepresent value as that using spo
t rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.115

Table of ContentsThe
 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment managementfees,
 for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes wereselected
 after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocationfor
 each  asset  class,  the  overall  expected  rate  of  return  for  the  portfolio  was  developed,  adjusted  for  historical  and  expected  experience  of  active  portfoliomanagement results
 compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company usedan
 expected  return  on  plan  assets  of 6.20%  to  estimate  its  2019  pension  benefit  costs,  and  an  expected  blended  return  based  on  weighted  assets  of 3.56%  to estimate its 2019 other 
postretirement benefit costs.The
 Company adopted a table based on the Society of Actuaries RP 2014 mortality table including a generational BB-2D projection scale. In 2018, theCompany
 adopted the new MP-2018 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward. In 2019, the Company maintained the MP-2018 mortality improvem
ent scale until it can conduct a new experience study.Presented in the table be

 Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than 10%  due to anevent that results in terminati
ons and/or retirements.Cumulative
 gains and losses that are in excess of 10%  of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortizedover the expected average remai
ning future service of the current active membership for the plans.Savings Plans for Employees
The
 Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions thatare
 invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject tocertain
 limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing anadditional 
5.25%  of  base  pay  defined  contribution  benefit  for  union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  afterJanuary
 1,  2006.  The  Company’s  401(k)  savings  plan  expenses  totaled $12  million, $12  million and $13  million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,  respectively.Additionally,
 the Company’s 5.25%  of  base pay defined contribution benefit expenses totaled $13 million , $11 million and $9 million  for 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. All of the Comp
any’s contributions are invested in one or more funds at the direction of the employees.116

The
 Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of December  31, 2019,  the Company has accruedapproximately 
$17  million of  probable  loss  contingencies  and  has  estimated  that  the  maximum  amount  of  losses  associated  with  reasonably  possible  losscontingencies
 that can be reasonably estimated is $25  million.  For certain matters, claims and actions, the Company is unable to estimate possible losses. TheCompany
 believes  that  damages  or  settlements,  if  any,  recovered  by  plaintiffs  in  such  matters,  claims  or  actions,  other  than  as  described  in  this Note  16—Commitments and Contingencies
, will not have a materi al adverse effect on the Company.West Virginia Elk River Fre
edom Industries Chemical SpillOn
 June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted final approval of a settlement class and global class actionsettlement
 (the “Settlement”) for all claims and potential claims by all class members (collectively, the “West Virginia Plaintiffs”) arising out of the January 2014Freedom Industries, Inc.
 chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement was July 16, 2018. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement,West
 Virginia-American Water Company (“WVAWC”) and certain other Company affiliated entities did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability forany of the allegations m
ade by the West Virginia Plaintiffs in any of the actions that were resolved.The
 aggregate  pre-tax  amount  contributed  by  WVAWC  of  the $126  million portion  of  the  Settlement  with  respect  to  the  Company,  net  of  insurancerecoveries, is 
$19 million . As of December 31, 2019 , $5 million of that $126 million  has  been reflected in accrued liabilities, and $5 million  in offsetting insurance receivables
 have been reflected in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount reflected in accrued liabilities as of December  31, 2019reflects
 reductions in the liability and appropriate reductions to the offsetting insurance receivable reflected in other current assets, associated with the ongoingprocessing of actual and pot
ential Settlement claims. The Company funded WVAWC’s contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity.Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class A
ction LitigationOn
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part ofWVAWC’s
 West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately25,000
 WVAWC  customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,2015, a
 second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80%  of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by
 the  next morning.  The second  repair  showed signs  of leaking,  but the  water  main  was  usable  until  June 29,  2015 to allow  tanks to  refill.  The  system  wasreconfigured
 to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000  customers  while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fullyrestored by July 1, 2015 to all custo
mers affected by this event.117

Table of ContentsOn
 June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries,  et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was  filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in KanawhaCounty
 on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaintalleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regardi
ng the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligenceby
 WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries  plaintiffs  seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lostprofits,
 annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipefailure and a large outage.
In
 October 2017, WVAWC filed with the court a motion seeking to dismiss all of the Jeffries plaintiffs’  counts alleging statutory and common law tortclaims.
 Furthermore,  WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegationsinvolving
 violations of the applicable tariff, the public utility code and related rules. In May 2018, the court, at a hearing, denied WVAWC’s motion to apply theprimary
 jurisdiction  doctrine,  and  in  October  2018,  the  court  issued  a  written  order  to  that  effect.  On  February  21,  2019,  the  court  issued  an  order  denyingWVAWC’s
 motion to dismiss the Jeffries plaintiffs’  tort claims. On August 21, 2019, the court set a procedural schedule in this case, including a trial date ofSeptember 21, 2020.
 Discovery in this case is ongoing. On February 4, 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed  a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breachof contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if impo
sed. A hearing on class certification iscurrently scheduled for M
arch 11, 2020.The
 Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. WVAWC is vigorouslydefending itself
 against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range ofsuch losses related to this p
roceeding.Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Ac
tion LitigationOn
 September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“TAWC”), experienced a break of a 36-inchwater
 transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the mainbreak
 by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon on September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for allcustomers on September 16, 2019.
On
 September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce,  et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was  filed in the Circuit Court of HamiltonCounty, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and Ame
rican Water Works Service Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the“Tennessee-American
 Water Defendants”), on behalf of an alleged class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result ofthe
 Chattanooga  main  break  (the  “Tennessee  Plaintiffs”).  The  complaint  alleges  breach  of  contract  and  negligence  against  the  Tennessee-American  WaterDefendants,
 as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. The Tennessee Plaintiffs seek an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses,business
 and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages,attorneys’ fees and pre- a
nd post-judgment interest.On
 November 22, 2019, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which reliefmay be granted, and, with respe
ct to the Company, for lack of personal jurisdiction. A hearing on this motion is scheduled for February 18, 2020.The
 Tennessee-American Water Defendants believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and they arevigorously
 defending themselves against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of anyloss or a range of such losses re
lated to this proceeding.118

The following methods and assumptions we
re used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:Current assets
 and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, includingrevolving credit debt, 
due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.Preferred
 stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirementsand
 long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debtclassified as Level
 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valuedusing
 observable and unobservable inputs. The fair values of instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3 are determined by a valuation model that is based on aconventional discounted
 cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market rates. The Company calculated a base yield curve using a risk-free rate(a
 U.S. Treasury securities yield curve) plus a credit spread that is based on the following two factors: an average of the Company’s own publicly-traded debtsecurities
 and the current market rates for U.S. Utility A debt securities. The Company used these yield curve assumptions to derive a base yield for the Level 2and
 Level 3 securities. Additionally, the Company adjusted the base yield for specific features of the debt securities including call features, coupon tax treatmentand collateral for 
the Level 3 instruments.Presented
 in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and thefair values of the Company’s

Table of ContentsFair Value Measurements
To
 increase  consistency  and  comparability  in  fair  value  measurements,  GAAP  establishes  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the  inputs  to  valuationtechniques used to measure 
fair value into three levels as follows:Level
 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.Financial
 assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs include  active  exchange-traded  equity  securities,  exchange-based  derivatives,  mutual  funds and  moneymarket funds.
Level
 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable throughcorroboration
 with  observable  market  data.  Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  2  inputs  include  fixed  income  securities,  non-exchange-basedderivatives, commingl
ed investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.Level
 3—Unobservable  inputs,  such  as  internally-developed  pricing  models  for  the  asset  or  liability  due  to  little  or  no  market  activity  for  the  asset  orliability.
 Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment fundssubject to purchase and sal
e restrictions.Recurring Fair Value Measurements

Table of ContentsRestricted
 funds—The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement offacilities and fro
m customers for future services under operation, maintenance and repair projects. Long-term restricted funds of less than $1 million  and $1 million were included in other long-
term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.Rabbi
 trust investments—The Company’s rabbi trust investments consist of equity and index funds from which supplemental executive retirement planbenefits and deferred 
compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Deposits—Deposits
 include  escrow  funds  and  certain  other  deposits  held  in  trust.  The  Company  includes  cash  deposits  in  other  current  assets  on  theConsolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred
 compensation  obligations—The  Company’s  deferred  compensation  plans  allow  participants  to  defer  certain  cash  compensation  into  notionalinvestment
 accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferredcompensation
 obligations is based on the market value of the participants’  notional investment  accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily  ofmutual funds, which are based on obse
rvable market prices.Mark-to-market
 derivative assets and liabilities—The Company utilizes fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, typically designated as fair-value hedges, toachieve
 a targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. The Company also employs derivative financial instruments in the form of variable-to-fixed
 interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps, classified as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest coston
 existing  or  forecasted  debt.  The  Company  uses  a  calculation  of  future  cash  inflows  and  estimated  future  outflows,  which  are  discounted,  to  determine  thecurrent fair value. Additi
onal inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.Other
 investments—Other  investments  primarily  represent  money  market  funds  used  for  active  employee  benefits.  The  Company  includes  otherinvestments in other cur
rent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Note 19: Leases
On
 January  1,  2019,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update 2016-02, Leases  (Topic  842),  and all  related  amendments  (collectively,  the“Standard”).
 The Company implemented the guidance in the Standard using the modified retrospective approach and applied the optional transition method, whichallowed
 entities to apply the new Standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in theperiod of adoption. Under this approac
h, prior periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.The
 Standard includes practical expedients, which relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the adoption date, initial directcosts
 for leases that commenced before the adoption date, the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase theunderlying asset and the abi
lity to carry forward accounting treatment for existing land easements.Adoption
 of the Standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 ofapproximately 
$117 million  and $115 million , respectively. The difference between the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The Stand
ard did not materially impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations and had no impact on cash flows.Certain
 operating leases have renewal options ranging from one  to 60 years.  The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion.Renewal
 options that the Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Company’s ROU assets. Certain operating leases contain the option topurchase
 the  leased  property.  The  operating  leases  for  real  property,  vehicles  and  equipment  will  expire  over  the  next 40  years, seven years,  and five  years, respectively.
The
 Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (“Partners”) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the Companytransferred
 a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”) issued by the Partnersunder
 the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a period of 30  to 40years
.  The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment, as ownership of the assets will revert back to the Companyat the end of the lease term.
 The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $147 million  and $147 million  as  of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. TheCompany
 determined  that  the  finance  lease  obligations  and  the  investments  in  IDBs  meet  the  conditions  for  offsetting,  and  as  such,  are  reported  net  on  theConsolidated Balance Sheets and ex
cluded from the finance lease disclosure presented below.121

Table of ContentsThe
 Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners’ assets in performing under theO&M
 agreements.  The  O&M  agreements  are  recorded  as  operating  leases,  and  future  annual  use  fees  of $4  million in  2020  through  2024,  and $54  millionthereafter, are 
included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Rental
 expenses under operating and finance leases presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $16 million  for  the year ended December 31, 2019.Rental
 expenses under operating leases which included variable and short-term lease costs were $35  million and $29  million for  the years ended December 31,2018 and 2017, respectively.

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The
 Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,conducted
 an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under th
e Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.Based on
 that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2019 , the Company’s disclosure controls
 and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonableassurance
 that  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  the  Company  in  the  reports  it  files  or  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,summarized
 and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC’s  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  tomanagement, including th
e Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report
ingThe
 Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined inRule
 13a-15(f)  of  the  Exchange  Act.  The  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  by  or  under  the  supervision  of  the  ChiefExecutive
 Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financialstatements
 for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that(i)
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonableassurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receiptsand
 expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  its  management  and its  directors,  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regardingprevention or timely detectio
n of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.The
 Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control overfinancial
 reporting,  as  of December  31,  2019,  using  the  criteria  described  in Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (COSO).Based
 on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal  Control—Integrated Framework (2013),  its management concluded that its internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was effective as of December 31, 2019 . The effectiveness of th
e Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019  has been audited by Pricewate rhouseCoopers LLP, anindependent
 registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item  8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K
. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The
 Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter that havematerially affected, or are reasonabl
y likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.126

Exhibit 4.20DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN WAT
ER WORKS COMPANY, INC.’S EQUITY SECURITIESThe
 following description of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), is not intended to be complete. For moreinformation
 regarding  the  Common  Stock,  please  refer  to  the  Company’s  Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  (the  “Certificate  of  Incorporation”),  and  theCompany’s Amended
 and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), which have been filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to the Company’s Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The follo
wing descriptions are based on the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as of February 18, 2020.The
 terms and provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are hereby incorporated by reference herein. The terms of these securities also may beaffected by the Genera
l Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”).General
The
 Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of February 13,2020, there were 
180,974,719  shares of Common Stock outstanding and no sha res of preferred stock outstanding.Common Stock
Voting Rights
Other
 than  with  respect  to  director  elections,  except  as  otherwise  required  by  law,  all  matters  to  be  voted  on  by  the  Company’s  shareholders  must  beapproved
 by a majority of the shares present in person or proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. With respect to uncontested directorelections,
 the Bylaws require that in order to be elected, a director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast (for this purpose, a majority of the votes castmeans
 that the number of shares voted “for” a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that nominee). For contested director electionswhere
 the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the Bylaws require that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of theshares represented in pe
rson or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.Dividends
Holders
 of Common Stock will share  equally  in any dividend  declared  by the Company’s board of directors  (the  “Board”),  subject to the rights of theholders of any outstanding pref
erred stock.Liquidation Rights
In
 the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company’s affairs, holders of Common Stock would be entitled,after
 payment of the liquidation preference to all holders of any outstanding preferred stock, to share ratably in the Company’s assets that are legally available fordistribution
 to shareholders after payment of liabilities. The Company must pay the applicable distribution to any holders of its preferred stock before it may paydistributions to the holders o
f Common Stock.Other Rights
The Company’s shareholders have no pr
eemptive or other rights to subscribe for additional shares.Preferred Stock
The
 Board  may  authorize  the  issuance  of  preferred  stock  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  series,  without  shareholder  approval.  Subject  to  the  limitsimposed
 by  the  DGCL,  the  Board  is  authorized  to  fix  for  any  series  of  preferred  stock  the  number  of  shares  of  such  series  and  the  voting  powers  (if  any),designation,
 preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series. The Board is alsoauthorized
 to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further voteor action by the Company’s shareho
lders.The Board
 may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that affect adversely the voting power or other rights of holders ofCommon
 Stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have theeffect
 of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, causing the market price of a share of Common Stock to decline, or impairing the voting and otherrights of the holders of Common Stock.

Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the DGCLThe
 following provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, even ifdoing so would benefit the Company’s shar
eholders.Undesignated Preferred Stock
The
 ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the Board to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with super voting, specialapproval,
 dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire the Company. These and otherprovisions may have the eff
ect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of the Company.Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Me
etings, Nominations and ProposalsThe Bylaws
 provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called only upon the request of the majority of the members of the Board, upon request ofthe
 Chairman of the Board, or by the Secretary of the Company upon request of shareholders holding at least 15% of the outstanding Common Stock. The Bylawsprohibit the conduct of any busin
ess at a special meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting.The
 Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election asdirectors,
 other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof. A shareholder who wishes to bring a matter before a meetingmust
 comply with the Company’s advance notice requirements  and provide the Company with certain information. Additionally, vacancies and newly createddirectorships
 may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, even though less than a quorum, or by shareholders. Theseprovisions
 may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwiseattempting to obtain con
trol of the Company.Shareholder Action by Written Consent
As
 permitted  by  Section  228  of  the  DGCL,  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  states  that  any  action  required  or  permitted  to  be  taken  by  the  Company’sshareholders must be eff
ected at a duly called annual or special meeting and may not be effected by consent in writing by such shareholders.Certain Anti-Takeover Matters
A
 significant number of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are subject to economic regulation by state public utility commissions. Some of these stateshave
 enacted laws that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of any regulated utility. In those states, obtaining “control” of the parent or anyother
 company that controls a regulated utility also requires prior regulatory approval. The threshold for a change in control is a fact-specific inquiry that varies bystate.
 For example, in some states, a presumption of control will arise when an acquiring party acquires more than 9.9% of the voting securities of the regulatedutility
 or the controlling entity. In addition to ownership, other states may analyze the degree of influence or control an acquiror may exert over the company. Anyperson
 acquiring Common Stock in an offering or in any other purchase of Common Stock in an amount sufficient to trigger a change in control under state lawwould need the prior approval of 
the applicable state public utility commission.Certain Other Provisions of the Certi
ficate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the DGCLBoard of Directors
The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the
 number of directors is fixed in the manner provided in the Bylaws. The Bylaws provide that the number ofdirectors will be fixed 
from time to time by the Board.Business Combinations under Delaware Law
The Company is subject to Section 203 of 
the DGCL, which prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” withan
 “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the time the shareholder became an “interested stockholder,” subject to certain exceptions, including if,prior
 to  such  time,  the  board  of  directors  approved  the  business  combination  or  the  transaction  which  resulted  in  the  shareholder  becoming  an  “interestedstockholder.” “Business combinations” include
 mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the “interested stockholder.” Subject tovarious
 exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or within the prior three years did own,15% or more of

the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. These restrictions generally prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change-in-controlattempts that are no
t approved by a company’s board of directors.Limitations of Liability and Indemni
fication of Directors and OfficersThe
 DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages forbreaches of directors’ fiduciary
 duties. The Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damagesfor actions taken as a di
rector to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. The DGCL does not permit exculpation for liability:•
for breach of the duty of loyalty;•
for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law;•
under Section 174 of the DGCL (relating to unlawful dividends or stock repurchases); or•
for transactions from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.The
 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. TheBylaws also
 expressly authorize the Company to carry directors’ and officers’ insurance providing indemnification for its directors, officers and certain employeesand agents for certain 
liabilities.The
 limitation  of  liability  and  indemnification  provisions  in  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  and  Bylaws  may  discourage  shareholders  from  bringing  alawsuit
 against  the Company’s  directors  for  breach  of  their  fiduciary  duty. These  provisions  may  also have  the effect  of reducing  the likelihood  of derivativelitigation
 against the Company’s directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and its shareholders. Inaddition,
 an  investment  in  the  Common  Stock  may  be  adversely  affected  to  the  extent  the  Company  pays  the  costs  of  settlement  and  damage  awards  againstdirectors and office
rs in accordance with these indemnification provisions.Transfer Agent and Registrar
American Stock Transfer & T
rust Company, LLC serves as the registrar and transfer agent for the Common Stock.New York Stock Exchange Listing
The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchang
e under the trading symbol “AWK.”

3.
    Performance Goals. (a)
    Unless a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period (as defined below), thedistribution
 of  the  shares  of  Company  Stock  attributable  to  the  Performance  Units  is  contingent  upon  achievement  of  theperformance goals set forth in 
Exhibit A  attached hereto (the “ Performance Goals ”) and  the Participant satisfying the continuation ofemployment and service with the Employer (as defined in the Plan) requirement described in Paragraph 4 below.
(b)
    As  soon  as  administratively  practicable  following  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period  (as  defined  in  Paragraph  3(d)below),
 the  Committee  will  determine  whether  and  to  what  extent  the  Performance  Goals  have  been  met  and  the  number  ofPerformance
 Units the Participant has earned, if any. Except as described in Paragraph 4 below, the Participant must be employedby, or providing service to, the Employer on the last day of the Performance Period in order to earn the Performance Units.
(c)
    If a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Company is not the surviving corporation(or
 survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation or entity (the “surviving  corporation”))  and the Performance Units are notconverted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), then the Performance

 the surviving corporation but the Participant ceases to be employed by, or providing service to, the surviving corporation (or aparent or subsidiary of the surviv
ing corporation) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change of Control on account of (i)a

 the Target Award level as of the Termination Date. For purposes of this Grant, “Change of Control
”  shall mean as such term is defined in the Plan, except that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred forpurposes
 of this Grant unless the event constituting the Change of Control constitutes a change in ownership or effective control ofthe
 Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, within the meaning of section 409A of theInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “
Code ”) and its corresponding regulations. (d)

 a termination for Cause (as defined below), the Participant will earn a pro-rata portion of the Performance Units, ifthe
 Performance Goals and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance Period. The pro-rata portionearned
 will be equal to the number of Performance Units that would have been earned if the Participant had remained employedthrough
 the last day of the Performance Period, multiplied by a fraction, which fraction shall be equal to (i) 1/3, if the Participant’semployment
 or service with the Employer terminates on or after January 31, 2020, but prior to January 31, 2021; (ii) 2/3, if theParticipant’s

 for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposalof
 a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change orevent
 similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2018.The ending
 point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss orexpense
 for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposalof
 a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change orevent similar in nature.
The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:
 
 
  Compounded EPS Growth

  7.3%
 25%  
  < 6.0%
 0% If
 actual  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  does  not  meet  threshold  performance  (i.e.,  less  than  6.0%  for  Compounded  EPSGrowth,
 then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units atits
 assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at 200%, and themaximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.

 for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposalof
 a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change orevent
 similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2018.The ending
 point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss orexpense
 for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposalof

  < 6.0%
 0% If
 actual  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  does  not  meet  threshold  performance  (i.e.,  less  than  6.0%  for  Compounded  EPSGrowth,
 then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units atits

 for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposalof
 a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change orevent
 similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2018.The ending
 point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss orexpense
 for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposalof
 a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change orevent similar in nature.
The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:
 
 
  Compounded EPS Growth
Actual 
Compounded EPS 
Growth
 Target Award 11.0% or more
 200%  
  9.8%
 175%  
  8.5%
 100%  
  7.3%
 25%  
  < 6.0%
 0% If
 actual  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  does  not  meet  threshold  performance  (i.e.,  less  than  6.0%  for  Compounded  EPSGrowth,
 then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units atits
 assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at 200%, and themaximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.

The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:
Earnings Per Share
 
 
        
 12/31/2018   12/31/2021  
 Adjusted   Illustration  
  Adjusted diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations
 $3.30   $4.27  
       Compounded EPS growth      8.97%  
       Earned Performance Units
 
      
 Achievement   Award  
  Compounded EPS Growth
 8.97%  127.5% In
 this example, the individual who was awarded a Target Grant of 1,000 Performance Units would earn 1,275 Performance Units(1,000 x 1.275), which is convertible

 payments to be made on or after the Participant’s Required Beginning Date to the Designated Beneficiary after theParticipant’s
 death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that wouldhave been payable to the Participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-6. If the Annuity Starting
Date

 lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Participant under the Uniform Lifetime Tableset
 forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9 for the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the Annuity StartingDate

n period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9 plus the excess of 70over
 the  age  of  the  Participant  as  of  the  Participant’s  birthday  in  the  year  that  contains  the  Annuity  Starting  Date.  If  theParticipant’s
 spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and nolife
 annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant’s applicable distribution period, as determinedunder
 this Section 6.6(c)(ii), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse asdetermined
 under  the  Joint  and  Last  Survivor  Table  set  forth  in  Treas.  Reg.  §  1.401(a)(9)-9,  using  the  Participant’s  andspouse’s
 attained ages as of the Participant’s and spouse’s birthdays in the calendar year that contains the Annuity StartingDate.

 Beneficiary  determined  using  the  Designated  Beneficiary’s  age  as  of  the  Designated  Beneficiary’sbirthday in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date.

 Participant’s  surviving  spouse  is  the  Participant’s  sole  Designated  Beneficiary,  and  the  surviving  spouse  dies  beforedistributions
 to  the  surviving  spouse  begin,  this  Section  6.6(d)  will  apply  as  if  the  surviving  spouse  were  the  Participant,except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to Section 6.6(a)(ii)(A).

 measurement date, then that limitation does not apply to benefits with annuity starting dates that are on or after that later section436 measurement date.
In
 addition, after the section 436 measurement date on which the limitation on prohibited payments under Section 17.1(a) or17.2(a)
 ceases to apply to the Plan, any Participant or beneficiary who had an annuity starting date within the period during whichthat
 limitation applied to the Plan is permitted to make a new election (within 90 days after the section 436 measurement date onwhich

 that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year would not be less than 60% taking into account anyrestored benefit accruals for the prior Plan Year.
(c)
    Shutdown and Other Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits. If  an unpredictable contingent event benefit with respectto
 an unpredictable contingent event that occurs during the Plan Year is not permitted to be paid after the occurrence of the eventbecause
 of  the  limitation  of  Section  17.2(b),  but  is  permitted  to  be  paid  later  in  the  same  Plan  Year  (as  a  result  of  additionalcontributions or
 pursuant to the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Yearthat
 meets the requirements of section 1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations), then that unpredictable contingent eventbenefit

    Effective for Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, in no case shall the annual benefit with respect to anyParticipant
 payable under the Plan and all other Defined Benefit Plans, when expressed in the form of an annual single life annuity(with
 no ancillary benefits), exceed the “maximum permissible benefit” which shall be the lesser of the amount determined underParagraph
 C.1.1 or C.1.2 (both adjusted where required, as provided in Paragraph C.1.3, and, if applicable, in Paragraph C.1.4 orParagraph C.1.5):
C.1.1
    the  dollar  limitation  specified  in  section  415(b)(1)(A)  of  the  Code,  as  in  effect  for  the  Limitation  Year($215,000
 for 2017), as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year under section 415(d) of the Code in such manner as theSecretary of the Treasury shall prescribe (the “Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation”)); or
C.1.2
    the greater of $10,000 or 100% of the Participant’s average annual Compensation received during the threeconsecutive
 years of Continuous Service (years of participation in the Plan for Limitation Years beginning before January 1,2006)
 with  the  Employer  and  all  50%  related  employers  during  which  he  receives  the  greatest  aggregate  annualCompensation.
 The  $10,000  restriction  shall  not  apply  if  the  Participant  participates  in  any  defined  contribution  planmaintained
 by the Employer, a 50% related employer or a predecessor employer. For purposes of determining the $10,000amount,
 the benefit payable to the Participant under the Plan for a Limitation Year reflects all amounts payable under thePlan
 for  the  Limitation  Year  (except  as  otherwise  provided  in  Treas.  Reg.  §  1.415(d)-1)  and  are  not  adjusted  for  faun  ofbenefit or commencement date.
C.1.3
    If the Participant has fewer than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitationshall
 be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in thePlan
 and (ii) the denominator of which is 10. In the case of a Participant who has fewer than 10 Years of Service with theEmployer, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limit
ation shall be multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number ofyears (or part thereof) of service with the Employer and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.
C.1.4
    If the benefit of a Participant begins prior to age 62, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable to theParticipant
 at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier agethat
 is the Actuarial  Equivalent  of the Defined  Benefit  Dollar Limitation  applicable  to the Participant  at age 62 (adjustedunder Paragraph C.1.3 above, if required). The Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable
APP-2-6

at an age prior to age 62 is determined as the lesser of (i) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit DollarLimitation computed using the interest rate
 provided under Section 2.1(b), or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of theDefined
 Benefit  Dollar  Limitation  computed  using  a  5  percent  interest  rate.  Any  decrease  in  the  Defined  Benefit  DollarLimitation
 determined  in  accordance  with  this  Paragraph  C.1.4  shall  not  reflect  a  mortality  decrement  if  benefits  are  notforfeited
 upon the death of the Participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken intoaccount.
Effective
 for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an ageprior to
 age 62 is determined as the lesser of (1) the actuarial equivalent at such age of the defined benefit dollar limitation computedusing
 a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (2) the amount determined bymultiplying
 the defined benefit dollar limitation by the ratio of the annual amount of the single life annuity beginning at such earlierage
 (computed using the interest rate and mortality table as applicable under Section 2.1(b)) to the annual amount of the single lifeannuity
 under the Plan commencing at age 62 (with both such amounts determined without application of the rules of section 415 ofthe Code).
C.1.5
    If  the  benefit  of  a  Participant  begins  after  the  Participant  attains  age  65,  the  Defined  Benefit  Dollar  Limitationapplicable
 to the Participant at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the laterage
 that is Actuarially Equivalent to the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable to the Participant at age 65 (adjusted underParagraph C.1.3 above, if required). The
 Actuarial Equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable at an age after age65
 is determined as the lesser of (i) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation computed usingthe interest rate provided under Section 2.1(b), or
 (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitationcomputed using a
 5 percent interest rate. For these purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence shallbe ignored.
Effective
 for  Limitation  Years  beginning  on  and  after  July  1,  2007,  for  benefits  commencing  after  age  65,  the  dollarlimitation
 shall  be  determined  as  the  lesser  of  (1)  the  actuarial  equivalent  at  such  age  of  the  defined  benefit  dollar  limitationcomputed
 using an interest rate of 5% and the applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (2) theamount
 determined  by  multiplying  the  defined  benefit  dollar  limitation  by  the  ratio  of  (A)  the  annual  amount  of  the  single  lifeannuity beginning at
 such later age (computed using the interest rate and mortality assumptions for delayed retirement benefits underthe
 Plan, if applicable) to (B) the annual amount of the single life annuity under the Plan commencing at age 65 (computed withoutusing
 the  interest  rate  and  mortality  assumptions  for  delayed  retirement  benefits  under  the  Plan,  if  applicable)  (with  both  suchamounts
 in (A) and (B) determined without application of the rules of section 415 of the Code). The amount of the annual benefitcommencing at such later age is the annual amount of the
APP-2-7

benefit (determined without regard to section 415 of the Code) computed by disregarding the Participant’s accruals after age 65, butincluding actuarial adjustments even if such adjustments are applied to offset benefit accrual.
C.1.6
    Benefit increases resulting from the increase in the limitations of section 415(b) of the Code shall be provided to allParticipants
 with benefits limited by section 415(b) of the Code who, (i) as of January 1, 2002 have commenced receipt of theirbenefit under the Plan; or (ii) are credited with at least one Hour of Service on or after January 1, 2002.
C.1.7
    If a Participant’s benefit is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity, the determination as to whether thelimitation of
 this Paragraph C.1 has been satisfied shall be made by adjusting such benefit to the form of a straight life annuity usingan
 interest  rate  equal  to  the  greater  of  5%  or  the  interest  rate  provided  under  Section  2.1(b).  However,  for  purposes  of  suchadjustment,
 any ancillary benefit that is not directly related to retirement income benefits and that portion of any joint and survivorannuity
 that constitutes a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity shall not be taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, forpurposes of adjusting any form of benefit subject to the
 requirements of section 417(e)(3) of the Code, the interest rate used shall notbe
 less than the greater of (i) the applicable interest rate under section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the October immediately precedingthe calendar year
 during which the Annuity Starting Date occurs, provided that the lump sum present value for distributions made onor
 before  October  1, 2007,  shall  not  be less  than  the  lump  sum present  value  based  on the  applicable  interest  rate  under  section417(e)(3)
 of the Code for the third calendar month preceding the calendar month in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs, or (ii)the interest rate specified in Section 2.1(b).
Notwithstanding anything
 herein to the contrary, for purposes of adjusting any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3) ofthe
 Code for Plan Years beginning in 2004 or 2005, the interest rate used shall not be less than the greater of (i) 5.5%, or (ii) theinterest rate specified in Section 2.1(b).
Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, effective for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, for purposes of applyingthe
 limitations under this Article C, if a Participant’s benefits are payable in a form of benefit other than a single life annuity or aqualified
 joint and survivor annuity, the benefit shall be limited as follows. The benefit shall be converted to a single life annuityusing
 the interest rate and mortality assumptions specified in the Plan for the Actuarial Equivalent of the particular form of benefitpayable.
 The single life annuity, which has been so determined, shall be compared to the single life annuity computed using a 5%interest rate
 assumption (or for any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, the applicable interest rate as defined insection
 417(e)(3) of the Code) and the IRS mortality table prescribed in section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) of the Code). The greater of thesetwo
 amounts shall be the applicable limit for the benefit payable in a form other than a single life annuity or a qualified joint andsurvivor annuity.
APP-2-8

Effective as of January 1, 2006, if a Participant’s benefit is payable in a form subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, suchbenefit
 shall be adjusted, for purposes of applying the limitations under this Article C, so that it is the greater of (1) a straight lifeannuity
 determined  using  the  interest  rate  and  mortality  table  as  applicable  under  Section  2.1(b),  (2)  a  straight  life  annuitydetermined
 using an interest rate of 5.5% and the applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (3) astraight
 life annuity determined using the interest rate that produces a benefit of not more than 105% of the benefit that would beproduced using the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code.
C.2
    Applicable  Mortality  Table  for  Distributions  With  Annuity  Starting  Dates  on  or  after  December  31,  2002. Notwithstanding
 any other Plan provisions to the contrary, the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefitor limitation
 under section 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the Code as set forth in this Article C (unless another mortality table is eitherrequired
 under section 415(b) of the Code or otherwise referenced in this Article C) is the table prescribed in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 forPlan
 Years beginning after December 31, 2007 (Rev. Rul. 2001-62 for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2008), or such othertable as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.
