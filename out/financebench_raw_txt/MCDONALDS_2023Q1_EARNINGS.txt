3 THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASE  
Constant currency  results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at 
prior year average exchange rates. Managem ent reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, 
impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation 
plans on these results bec ause the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.  
Comparable sales and comparable guest counts  are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and 
transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether oper ated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months 
including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling , 
rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters and  acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities (including restaurants temporarily closed due 
to COVID -19, as well as those that remain closed in Ukraine). Restaurants in Russia were treated as permanently closed as of April 1, 
2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable guest counts beginning in the second quarter of 
2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally 
identified as those m arkets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three -year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more 
accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, McDonald's excluded results from Argentina and 
Lebanon in the calculation of comparable sales due to hyperinflation (Venezuela continues to be excluded). Comparable sales are drive n by 
changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.  
Systemwide  sales  include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from 
digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company -operated and franchised restaurants. While 
franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding t he 
Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenue s and 
are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company- operated restaurants and 
fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide 
sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.   
Free cash flow , defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free 
cash flow divide d by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits 
into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
